The classification of information as Confidential Information, SSI, and/or PCII is made by the TJPA and/or the United States Department of Transportation and the United States Department of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration).\nThe TJPA recognizes the need to share certain Confidential Information, SSI, and/or PCII with the Designated Individual and Contractor to allow them to prepare and submit a bid for a portion of the work at the Project and/or perform a portion of the work at the Project. The Designated Individual and Contractor acknowledge that in order for them to perform their duties and/or obligations with regard to preparing and submitting a bid or performing their work at the Project, they may require access to certain Confidential Information, SSI, and/or PCII, and that the TJPA, by granting the Designated Individual access to such information, has placed a special confidence and trust in him/her to ensure that such information is not subject to unauthorized disclosure and use. Therefore, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Designated Individual, for himself/herself and on behalf of the Contractor, agrees as follows:\n1. Applicable Definitions.\na. Confidential Information. As used herein, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes (1) information that contains sensitive financial, commercial, or other proprietary business information concerning or relating to the TJPA or the Project; (2) information that contains sensitive financial, commercial, or other proprietary business information received from third parties under Non-Disclosure and/or Confidentiality Agreements; or (3) information that the TJPA has determined, in its sole discretion, to constitute confidential, privileged, sensitive, or proprietary information concerning the Project\u2019s security, operations, or facilities.\n b. Sensitive Security Information or SSI. As used herein, the terms \u201cSensitive Security Information\u201d or \u201cSSI\u201d includes information about security, operations, facilities or other assets or capital projects whose disclosure would be detrimental to the security of TJPA\u2019s employees or patrons, or would invade an individual\u2019s privacy, or reveal trade secrets or privileged or confidential information.\nc. Protected Critical Infrastructure Information or PCII. As used herein, the terms \u201cProtected Critical\nInfrastructure Information\u201d or \u201cPCII\u201d includes information that is not customarily in the public domain and relates to the security of critical infrastructure or protected systems and includes information regarding systems, facilities, or operational security, or that is proprietary, business sensitive, or which might be used to identify a person who submits such information to a federal agency, such as the Department of Homeland Security.\nd. Specification. As used herein, the term \u201cSpecification\u201d refers to the Specification set forth in Section 01 35 70, entitled \u201cDocument Control Procedure For Protected Information\u201d (\u201cTJPA\u2019s Document Control Procedure\u201d).\n2. Non-Disclosure Of Confidential Information, SSI, Or PCII.\nConfidential Information, SSI, and PCII shall be held and treated in the strictest confidence in a manner designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure to third parties. Confidential Information, SSI, and PCII may appear in records in written or electronic form, including but not limited to, drawings, photographs, schematics, plans, memorandums, reports, emails, videos, tape recordings, and Powerpoint presentations. Confidential Information, SSI, and/or PCII shall not be disclosed to third parties without the express written permission of the Executive Director of the TJPA or her designee; and if such permission is granted, then said information will be provided only upon the execution of a Non-Disclosure Agreement by that third party.\nIf at any time Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII is disclosed in violation of this Agreement, including but not limited to any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation that the Designated Individual has knowledge of (whether or not he/she is personally involved), the Designated Individual shall immediately give the TJPA written notice of that fact and a detailed account of the circumstances regarding such disclosure. The Designated Individual\u2019s anonymity shall be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.\n3. Use and Handling of Information.\nConfidential Information, SSI, or PCII so marked shall be used solely for the purpose of preparing and submitting a bid for a portion of the work at the Project and/or performing work at the Project, and shall not be used for any other purpose without the express written consent by the Executive Director of the TJPA or her designee.\nConfidential Information, SSI, and PCII shall be handled and safeguarded by the Designated Individual in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information.\nThe Designated Individual shall not alter or remove the protective markings of \u201cConfidential Information,\u201d \u201cSensitive Security Information,\u201d or \u201cProtected Critical Infrastructure Information,\u201d which may appear on documents that the Designated Individual reviews. Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII may be used for the sole purpose of preparing and submitting a bid for a portion of the work at the Project and/or performing work at the Project. If the Designated Individual must use Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII to create derivative documents for the purpose of preparing and submitting a bid for a portion of the work and/or performing work at the Project, the appropriate protective marking shall be carried forward to the derivative documents. All derivative documents shall be protected in the same manner as the original documents.\n4. Representations And Warranties.\nThe Designated Individual represents and warrants that he/she has reviewed, understands, and is familiar with the TJPA\u2019s Document Control Procedure, the Contractor\u2019s Document Control Procedure, and the standards for protecting Confidential Information, SSI, and PCII as set forth in the TJPA\u2019s Document Control Procedure and as set forth in the relevant laws, regulations, and/or directives applicable to the specific categories of information to which the Designated Individual may be granted access.\nThe Designated Individual further represents and warrants that he/she understands that the TJPA may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding information under this Agreement.\nThe Designated Individual further represents and warrants that he/she is an employee, officer, director, agent, representative, subcontractor, or consultant that has been designated by the Contractor as a person with a need to know the Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII to prepare and submit a bid for a portion of the work and/or perform work at the Project, and is fully authorized to enter into this Agreement by the Contractor.\n5. Requests For Disclosure By Third Parties.\nIf a subpoena, discovery request, Court order, Freedom Of Information Act Request, or any other request or demand authorized by law seeking disclosure of the Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII is received by the Designated Individual, individually or on behalf of the Contractor, the Designated Individual shall immediately notify the TJPA thereof in order to permit the TJPA to investigate the circumstances, prepare any appropriate documentation, seek to quash the subpoena, to seek a protective order, or to take such other action regarding the request as it deems appropriate; and the undersigned will fully cooperate in the TJPA\u2019s efforts in this regard. The Designated Individual, the Contractor, and its respective counsel will use their best efforts to obtain confidential treatment thereof by cooperating with the TJPA to obtain a protective order. In the absence of a protective order, disclosure shall be made of only that part of the Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII as is required to be disclosed, after advisement and consultation with the TJPA. If Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII is inappropriately disclosed, the undersigned will immediately report that fact and the circumstances to the TJPA.\n6.

The Designated Individual understands and acknowledges that for documents returned to the TJPA, it is within the TJPA\u2019s sole discretion to determine whether to destroy or maintain any returned documents.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if required by law, the Designated Individual may retain documents containing Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII only if: (1) the TJPA is notified in writing of such retention; and (2) the Designated Individual continues to abide by the requirements of this Agreement with respect to protection of Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII.\n7. Violations And Remedies.\nUnauthorized Disclosure: If a Contractor or any Designated Individual knows or has a reasonable belief that documents subject to the Specification have been or may be disclosed to an unauthorized person(s), the Contractor and/or Designated Individual shall immediately notify the TJPA. The TJPA shall make the final determination as to whether a violation of the Specification occurred and the course of action to address the violation.\nRemedies: Any Contractor or Designated Individual that violates the Specification with respect to Confidential Information, SSI and/or PCII shall, at the TJPA\u2019s election, be subject to any of the following: (1) written reprimand of the Contractor and/or Designated Individual; (2) termination of the Contractor or Designated Individual\u2019s access to Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII; (3) directive to the Contractor to immediately suspended the Designated Individual from performing any further work relating to the Project; (4) if a contract has been awarded, treatment of the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII as a material breach of the contract, warranting the termination of the contract for cause; (5) commencement of legal proceedings for any other legal rights and remedies, including injunctive relief and monetary damages arising from the breach of contract; (6) reporting of any violation related to SSI or PCII to the Department of Homeland Security, the Transportation Security Administration, or the Department of Transportation (these agencies may also independently assess penalties and/or take corrective action as provided under Federal law, including 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 15.17 and 1520.17); (7) disqualification of a Contractor from bidding on any work for the Project; and/or (8) written directive to retrieve all Confidential Information, SSI, and/or PCII disclosed to unauthorized persons at Contractor\u2019s expense and to cease future unauthorized disclosure.

Furthermore, Contractor agrees to indemnify the TJPA for any expenses or damages (including attorney\u2019s fees or costs) incurred by the TJPA arising out of or relating to the Contractor and/or Designated Individual\u2019s unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, SSI, and/or PCII.\n8. Duration And Survival Of Confidentiality Obligations.\nThe obligations under this Agreement shall be perpetual (unless otherwise provided for herein) or until such time as the information is no longer considered Confidential Information, SSI, or PCII and a written notice to that fact is provided to the Designated Individual and/or the Contractor by the Executive Director of the TJPA.\n9.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA)\nTHIS AGREEMENT is made on __________ by and between _________________________________, (\""Discloser\"") and M5 Computer Security (\""Recipient\"").\n1. Purpose. The Discloser has agreed to make available to the Recipient certain Confidential Information (as defined below) of the Discloser for the purpose of performing an Information Security Assessment of the Discloser. Additionally, while performing Penetration Testing activities, the Recipient may discover Confidential Information about the Discloser.\n2. Definition. \""Confidential Information\"" means any information, technical data, or know-how, including, but not limited to, that which relates to research, product plans, products, services, customers, markets, software, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing or finances, which Confidential Information is designated in writing to be confidential or proprietary, or if given orally, is confirmed promptly in writing as having been disclosed as confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information does not include information, technical data or know-how which: (i) is in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure as shown by the receiving party's files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (ii) prior or after the time of disclosure becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving party; or (iii) is approved for release by the Discloser in writing.\n3. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than that set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement. The Recipient will not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties except those directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents of Recipient who are required to have the information in order to carry out the purpose set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement. Recipient has had or will have directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents of Recipient to whom Confidential Information is disclosed or who have access to Confidential Information sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in content substantially similar to this Agreement and will promptly notify the Discloser in writing of the names of each such person who has signed such agreements after such agreements are signed. Recipient agrees that it will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized hereunder to have any such information, which measures shall include the highest degree of care that Recipient utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. Recipient agrees to notify the Discloser in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of such Confidential Information which may come to its attention.\n4. Mandatory Disclosure. In the event that the Recipient or its directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents are requested or required by legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Recipient shall give prompt notice so that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief. In the event that such protective order is not obtained, the Recipient shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which its counsel advises that it is legally required to disclose.\n5. Return of Materials. Any materials or documents of which have been furnished by the Discloser to the Recipient will be promptly returned, accompanied by copies of such documentation, after the evaluation set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement has been concluded.\n6. No License Granted. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to Recipient under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right nor shall this Agreement grant Recipient any rights in or to the other party's Confidential Information, except the limited right to review such Confidential Information solely for the purpose set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement.\n7. Term. The foregoing commitments shall survive any termination of discussions between the parties, and shall continue for a period of three (3) years following the date of this Agreement.\n8. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be binding upon and for the benefit of the undersigned parties, their successors and assigns, provided that Confidential Information may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the Discloser. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any term hereof.\n9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, and shall be binding upon the parties hereto in The United States of America and worldwide. The federal and state courts within the State of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of this Agreement.\n10. Remedies. Recipient agrees that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the Discloser and its business, and expressly agrees that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate the Discloser for any breach of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Recipient agrees and acknowledges that any such violation or threatened violation will cause irreparable injury to the Discloser and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or otherwise, the Discloser shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\nDISCLOSER RECIPIENT (M5 Computer

No Formal Business Relationship. This Agreement is for the purpose of protecting Confidential Information only and shall not be construed to create any agency, partnership, joint venture or other such relationship between the parties, nor shall the exchange of Confidential Information represent any commitment by the parties to enter into any business relationship.

Breach of Confidentiality. The Receiving Party shall immediately notify the Disclosing Party upon learning of any actual or potential access of its Confidential Information by unauthorized third parties. If (i) an Authorized Person\u2019s or former Authorized Person\u2019s action or omission would be considered a breach of this Agreement if they had been a party thereto, and (ii) the Receiving Party has coercive power over them at the time of such action or omission, then the Receiving Party shall be responsible for such action or omission as if it were its own breach.\n3.7. Required Disclosures.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement is entered into by and between Frames Data Inc., a California corporation with a business address at 100 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10013 (\u201cFDI\u201d), and ________________________________, a ______________ __________________ with a business address at __________________ (\u201cDeveloper\u201d).\nWHEREAS, FDI has compiled and maintains certain databases pertaining to ophthalmic frame style specifications which it updates and modifies from time to time that includes textual and graphic data relating to frames manufactured by various manufacturers (the \u201cData\u201d); Developer develops optical practice management software applications (the \u201cApplications\u201d) and wishes to obtain a sample of certain Data (the \u201cSample Data\u201d) for the sole purpose of assessing whether Developer can adapt the Applications to be compatible with the Sample Data (the \u201cPermitted Purpose\u201d); and FDI is willing to provide Developer with a sample of Sample Data for the Permitted Purpose for a limited time (the \u201cAssessment Period\u201d) on the terms and conditions set forth below;\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises made below, the parties agree as follows:\n1. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use of Sample Data\na. Non-Use. Developer shall not use any Sample Data for any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose.\nb. Non-Disclosure. Except as provided in subsection (c) below, Developer shall not disclose any Sample Data to any third party or to its own employees, agents or professional advisors except employees, agents or professional advisors who are required to have the Sample Data to implement the Permitted Purpose. Developer shall have each employee to whom any Sample Data will be disclosed, or who will have access to Sample Data, sign a nondisclosure agreement that is substantially similar to this Agreement. Developer shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of the Sample Data, including, without limitation, using the highest degree of care that Developer uses to protect its own confidential information. Developer shall notify FDI in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of Sample Data immediately after it becomes aware of such misuse or misappropriation. Developer shall not reproduce any Sample Data in any form or store it in a retrieval system or database without FDI\u2019s prior written consent, except as Developer reasonably may require for the Permitted Purpose.\nc. Legal Compulsion. If Developer becomes legally compelled to disclose any Sample Data, Developer shall provide FDI with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that FDI may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or both, or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n2. Return of Sample Data. When the Assessment Period is over, if the parties have not agreed to go forward and sign a comprehensive agreement that permits Developer to use the Data to modify its Applications and pursuant to which FDI will provide Developer with the technical documents that are necessary for Developer to do so, Developer shall return to FDI or destroy all copies of the Sample Data in its possession or control.\n3. Term. Due to the valuable and proprietary nature of the Sample Data, the obligations assumed by Developer hereunder other than those stated in Section 1(c) shall be unlimited in time or territory.\n4. Ownership. Developer acknowledges that FDI owns the Sample Data and agrees not to challenge FDI\u2019s ownership of the Data or the Sample Data.\n5. Injunctive Relief. Developer agrees that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure by it of any Sample Data, and that, in addition to all other remedies, Developer shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for Developer\u2019s unauthorized use or disclosure, without the requirement of posting any bond. In the event that FDI deems it appropriate to initiate any action to enforce the obligations of Developer under this Agreement, and should Developer be held to have breached this Agreement, Developer shall reimburse FDI for all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\n6. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.\nFrames Data Inc.\nBy: _________________________\nName: Thomas Lamond\nTitle: President\n[Developer]\nBy: _________________________\nName: _______________________\nTitle: ________________________\n"",","nondisclosure, agreementnthis, nondisclosure, agreement, entered, frame, data, inc, california, corporation, business, address, 100, avenue, america, new, york, new, york, 10013, u201cfdiu201d, business, address, u201cdeveloperu201dnwhereas, fdi, compiled, maintains, certain, database, pertaining, ophthalmic, frame, style, specification, update, modifies, time, time, includes, textual, graphic, data, relating, frame, manufactured, various, manufacturer, u201cdatau201d, developer, develops, optical, practice, management, software, application, u201capplicationsu201d, wish, obtain, sample, certain, data, u201csample, datau201d, sole, purpose, assessing, whether, developer, adapt, application, compatible, sample, data, u201cpermitted, purposeu201d, fdi, willing, provide, developer, sample, sample, data, permitted, purpose, limited, time, u201cassessment, periodu201d, term, condition, set, forth, belownnow, therefore, consideration, mutual, promise, made, party, agree, followsn1, nondisclosure, nonuse, sample, datana, nonuse, developer, shall, use, sample, data, purpose, permitted, purposenb, nondisclosure, except, provided, subsection, c, developer, shall, disclose, sample, data, third, party, employee, agent, professional, advisor, except, employee, agent, professional, advisor, required, sample, data, implement, permitted, purpose, developer, shall, employee, sample, data, disclosed, access, sample, data, sign, nondisclosure, agreement, substantially, similar, agreement, developer, shall, take, reasonable, measure, protect, secrecy, avoid, disclosure, use, sample, data, including, without, limitation, using, highest, degree, care, developer, us, protect, confidential, information, developer, shall, notify, fdi, writing, misuse, misappropriation, sample, data, immediately, becomes, aware, misuse, misappropriation, developer, shall, reproduce, sample, data, form, store, retrieval, system, database, without, fdiu2019s, prior, written, consent, except, developer, reasonably, may, require, permitted, purposenc, legal, compulsion, developer, becomes, legally, compelled, disclose, sample, data, developer, shall, provide, fdi, prompt, prior, written, notice, requirement, fdi, may, seek, protective, order, appropriate, remedy, waive, compliance, term, agreementn2, return, sample, data, assessment, period, party, agreed, go, forward, sign, comprehensive, agreement, permit, developer, use, data, modify, application, pursuant, fdi, provide, developer, technical, document, necessary, developer, developer, shall, return, fdi, destroy, copy, sample, data, possession, controln3, term, due, valuable, proprietary, nature, sample, data, obligation, assumed, developer, hereunder, stated, section, 1c, shall, unlimited, time, territoryn4, ownership, developer, acknowledges, fdi, owns, sample, data, agrees, challenge, fdiu2019s, ownership, data, sample, datan5, injunctive, relief, developer, agrees, money, damage, would, adequate, remedy, unauthorized, use, disclosure, sample, data, addition, remedy, developer, shall, entitled, specific, performance, injunctive, equitable, relief, remedy, developeru2019s, unauthorized, use, disclosure, without, requirement, posting, bond, event, fdi, deems, appropriate, initiate, action, enforce, obligation, developer, agreement, developer, held, breached, agreement, developer, shall, reimburse, fdi, cost, expense, including, reasonable, attorneysu2019, feesn6, governing, law, agreement, shall, governed, law, state, new, york, without, regard, conflict, law, provisionsnframes, data, incnby, nname, thomas, lamondntitle, presidentndevelopernby, nname, ntitle, n"
"      Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThis Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is effective as of the date of Company\u2019s electronic acceptance (\u201cEffective Date\u201d).\nKimberly-Clark Corporation and/or Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. and/or Kimberly-Clark Global Sales, LLC and/or one or more of Kimberly-Clark\u2019s other subsidiaries, affiliates or licensees (collectively ''K-C''); and Company desire to review or evaluate a subject of mutual interest (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\nAccordingly, either party may find it desirable or necessary to disclose information which may be considered proprietary and confidential by the party making the disclosure (''Confidential Information''). Such Confidential Information will be disclosed for the Purpose and for no other purpose in accordance with the following understandings:\n1. Confidentiality Obligations. Each party shall maintain in confidence Confidential Information obtained from the other and use such Confidential Information only for the Purpose. Such Confidential Information shall be identified in writing and marked ''Confidential'' by the disclosing party or, if first presented orally or visually, shall be reduced to writing, the writing marked ''Confidential'' by the disclosing party and delivered to the receiving party within twenty (20) days of the oral or visual disclosure. Each party agrees to treat Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other with the same degree of care as it does in protecting its own confidential and proprietary information, and the Confidential Information shall be disclosed within the recipient party only on a need-to-know basis.\n2. Exceptions to Confidentiality Obligations. The obligations of confidentiality and non-use shall not apply to Confidential Information which the receiving party can document: (a) at the time of disclosure was generally known to the public or, after such disclosure, became generally known to the public other than by a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party; (b) was already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of such disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) was later received on a non-confidential basis by the receiving party from a third party having the right to impart such Confidential Information; or (d) is developed by an employee of the receiving party who did not have access to the Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be within one or more of the foregoing exceptions merely because any part of such Confidential Information is embodied in general disclosures or because individual features, components or combinations are now or hereafter become publicly known.\n3. Compelled Disclosure. If any party becomes legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information of the other, the party so compelled shall promptly notify the other party and shall cooperate with the other party in securing a protective order or any similar action taken to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. The party so compelled shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is legally required to furnish.\n4. Publicity. In addition to the foregoing obligations, the parties to this Agreement agree to consult with and obtain written permission from the other party prior to publishing or disseminating any advertising, promotion or other printed material, participating in seminar/symposia presentations or other activity which would disclose that they have participated in a review or evaluation of the Confidential Information, have a pending or actual business relationship and/or any details of that relationship.\n5.

All written, printed, electronically stored or other tangible documents, samples and materials submitted by one party to the other hereunder, and all copies thereof remaining in the receiving party\u2019s possession, shall promptly be returned to the disclosing party and electronic media erased upon request or upon termination of this Agreement, except that a copy of each may be retained by the receiving party under appropriate security.\n6. No Additional Rights or Obligations. Nothing in this Agreement shall be understood as granting, expressly or by implication, any rights to either party under the patents, technical information or know-how of the other party except to the extent expressly set forth herein, nor as giving rise to any obligation on the part of either party to supply or to purchase any goods or services to the other party.\n7. Term; Termination. Either party may at any time upon written notice terminate this Agreement; otherwise participation by the parties in the review or evaluation shall end, and this Agreement shall terminate ten (10) years from the Effective Date.\n8. Survival. Termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not relieve either party of the obligations of confidentiality and non-use respecting Confidential Information disclosed to such party, which shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of ten (10) years, or in the case of a trade secret, such Confidential Information shall survive until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret.\n9. Independent Contractors. The parties hereto at all times remain independent contractors, and no express or implied representations to the contrary shall be made.\n10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except in writing signed by both parties.\n11. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their successors in business, but shall not otherwise be assignable.\n12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wisconsin, U.S.A. pertaining to contracts made and performed within that state, without recourse to any conflicts of laws principles.\n13.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cNDA\u201d) between MAGNET FORENSICS, INC. (\u201cMagnet Forensics\u201d), with headquarters at 156 Columbia Street West, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada and XXXX (\u201cParticipant\u201d) with headquarters at __[address]__ is intended to define each party\u2019s obligations respecting the treatment of certain disclosed information and shall be effective as of XXXX (\u201cEffective Date\u201d).\n1. DEFINITIONS.\na. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information regardless of form or medium, whether tangible or intangible, including any copies or fixations made thereof that is disclosed (or to which the Recipient is otherwise provided access) by Discloser that is proprietary or confidential to Discloser or its affiliated companies or to their respective customers, suppliers or other business partners including, without limitation, information that specifies, concerns or is related to Discloser\u2019s intellectual property, trade secrets, business operations, finances, customers, technical know-how, prototypes, designs, processes, products, services, or the development, testing or commercial exploitation of any of the foregoing that is either specifically identified as confidential prior to or at the time of its disclosure or that would reasonably be considered by a person knowledgeable in the industry to be proprietary or confidential in nature because of legends or other markings on the information, the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of the information itself.\nb. \u201cDiscloser\u201d means the party disclosing information.\nc. \u201cRecipient\u201d means the party receiving the disclosed Confidential Information.\n2. TERM AND PROTECTION PERIODS. This NDA shall commence upon the Effective Date and shall continue for a period of one (1) year unless sooner terminated in writing by either party. This NDA will automatically renew for subsequent one (1) year periods on the anniversary of the Effective Date, unless otherwise terminated in writing by either party. All obligations contained herein shall continue to bind the parties, their successors and permitted assigns and representatives, until the latter of (a) expiry or termination of this NDA or (b) three years from disclosure to Recipient.\n3. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS.\na. Recipient shall hold Confidential Information in confidence and use, reproduce and disclose the Confidential Information only to the extent reasonably required to facilitate a business relationship between the parties (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\nb. Recipient shall protect the Confidential Information using the same degree of care that Recipient uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature to prevent the unauthorized use, reproduction or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Such care shall not be less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any employees, contractors, or third parties except to those employees, contractors or third parties who have a need to know the Confidential Information to fulfill the Purpose, provided that: (i) Recipient shall be vicariously\nliable for any act or omission of such employees, contractors or third parties respecting the Confidential Information, (ii) such employee, contractor or third party has been advised of the confidentiality obligations contained in this NDA and has either agreed in writing to be bound by the obligations of this NDA, or has entered into a binding written obligation of confidentiality with the Recipient that affords substantially similar protection of the Confidential Information.\nc. Recipient agrees that it shall not alter, modify, adapt, create derivative works, translate, deface, decompile, disassemble, convert into human readable form, or reverse engineer all, or any part, of any materials to which it is provided access by Discloser.\nd. Each party will promptly advise the other in writing of any misappropriation or misuse by any person of such Confidential Information of which it may become aware.\n4. EXCLUSIONS. Information that Recipient can establish: (a) was lawfully in Recipient's possession before receipt from Discloser without any confidentiality obligation attached thereto; or (b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; or (c) was independently developed or discovered by Recipient without use of any Confidential Information obtained from Discloser, shall not be considered Confidential Information under this NDA. Additionally, it shall not be considered a breach of this NDA if Recipient discloses Confidential Information if and only to the extent: (i) it is required to do so by law provided that Recipient gives Discloser sufficient notice to enable it to seek an order limiting or precluding such disclosure; or (ii) Discloser gives its prior written authorization to do so which is signed by an officer of the Discloser, provided that Recipient complies with the disclosure parameters set forth in such authorization.\n5. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. At the Discloser\u2019s request, the Recipient shall promptly return any or all Confidential Information received from the Discloser (including, without limitation, any summaries or copies or Confidential Information) or will certify through an officer of the Recipient that all Confidential Information received from the Discloser, and any summaries or copies thereof, have been destroyed. For greater certainty, failure of the Discloser to make such request of Recipient shall not entitle Recipient to make any further use of the Confidential Information or otherwise extend Recipient\u2019s rights set forth herein after expiration or termination of this NDA and Recipient specifically agrees to cease any further use of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information in such event.\n6. NO RESTRICTIONS ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE. The Participant acknowledges that Magnet Forensics may develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to their Confidential Information. Nothing in this NDA shall prohibit Magnet Forensics from developing products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Participant\u2019s Confidential Information provided that Magnet Forensics does not violate any of its obligations under this NDA. The parties agree that because of exposure to Participant\u2019s Confidential Information, employees of Magnet Forensics may gain or enhance their general knowledge, skills and experience (including ideas, concepts, know-how and techniques) related to Participant's business (\""General Knowledge\""). The subsequent use by these employees of such General Knowledge as retained in their unaided memories, without reference to Confidential Information in written, electronic or other fixed form, shall not constitute a breach of this NDA. Magnet Forensics shall have no obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of employees or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of such General Knowledge.\n7. RIGHTS. All right, title and interest in and to the Confidential Information is and shall remain with the Discloser, and no rights to the Confidential Information are granted under this NDA other than the rights expressly granted in Section 3. Recipient shall not acquire any ownership right, interest or title in or to the Confidential Information or any intellectual property rights therein or the right to obtain or apply for such rights under this NDA.\n8. REMEDIES. Recipient acknowledges that the Confidential Information has been developed at significant cost and has significant commercial value to Discloser, and Recipient agrees that disclosure or inappropriate use of the Confidential Information could cause Discloser irreparable harm. Recipient agrees therefore that Discloser will have the right to seek, in addition to any of its other rights and remedies under law and equity, injunctive relief for any violation of this NDA without posting bond or by posting bond at the lowest amount required by law.\n9. NO WARRANTY. This NDA shall not obligate either party to disclose any Confidential Information to the other party or enter into any further agreement or business arrangement with the other party. ANY INFORMATION EXCHANGED UNDER THIS NDA IS PROVIDED \""AS IS\"". Discloser makes no representation, warranty or guarantee whatsoever about the Confidential Information.\n10. GOVERNING LAW. Without regard to conflict of law provisions, this NDA is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario in relation to all matters pertaining to or arising out of this NDA.\n11. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This NDA constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this NDA and cancels and supersedes any prior discussions, correspondence, understandings, agreements, or communications of any nature relating to the subject matter of this NDA.\n12. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\na. All additions or modifications to this NDA must be made in writing and must be signed by an officer of both parties.\nb. No waiver by either party of a breach or omission by the other party under this NDA shall be binding on the waiving party unless it is expressly made in writing and signed by an officer of the waiving party. Waiver by a party of an individual breach or omission by the other party shall not affect or impair the rights of the waiving party in respect of any subsequent breach or omission of the same or different kind.\nc. If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any provision in this NDA invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall have no effect on the remainder of the NDA which shall remain in full force.\nd. Recipient may not export any Confidential Information unless Recipient complies with all applicable export laws.\ne. This NDA does not create any agency or partnership relationship between the parties.\nf. Participant may not assign this NDA without the express prior written authorization of Magnet Forensics. Subject to the foregoing, this NDA shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns.\ng. This NDA may be signed in two or more counterparts each of which together will be deemed to be an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Signing of this NDA and transmission by facsimile document transfer will be acceptable and binding upon the parties hereto.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this NDA.\nMAGNET FORENSICS, INC.

It is agreed that no license and more particularly no licence under any patents or copyrights of any party is granted by this Agreement or by any disclosure of Proprietary Information hereunder.\n5. The parties shall not be liable for disclosure or use of Proprietary Information which:\na) was at the time of receipt otherwise known to the party receiving it without any breach of an obligation of confidentiality;\nb) was published or is otherwise within the public knowledge or is generally known to the public at the time of its disclosure to the receiving party, or becomes part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the recipient;\nc) is developed independently by the recipient or parent, subsidiary or associated companies of the recipient without recourse to the Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder;\nd) becomes legally known or available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party, and without breach of this Agreement by the recipient;\ne) becomes available to the receiving party by inspection or analysis of products available in the market other than the products of either party;\nf) is so disclosed or used with the written approval of the other party;\ng) if, and then to the extent that disclosure is required by law to be given to a governmental body or a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the recipient provides to the disclosing party prompt notice of any such requirement to disclose the Proprietary Information, to permit the disclosing party to seek an appropriate remedy to prevent the disclosure or alternatively to agree to the terms of such disclosure.\n6. No party shall be liable for the inadvertent or accidental disclosure of Proprietary Information if such disclosure occurs despite the exercise of the same degree of care as such party normally takes to preserve and safeguard its own Proprietary Information, but in any event no less than a reasonable degree of care.\n7. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies the disclosing party may have, each party acknowledges and agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement; therefore the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek injunctive (final, interlocutory and provisional or preliminary), specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the provisions of this Agreement before any court of competent jurisdiction.\n8. This Agreement shall, unless earlier terminated as indicated hereafter, be for a term of one (1) year from the date first above mentioned, and be renewed automatically for one year periods, unless a party sends in writing to the other a notice of non-renewal, thirty days prior to the expiration of a term. The disclosing party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement should the recipient fail to comply with any of the provisions of the Agreement.\n9. Notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement, as they relate to the safeguard, disclosure or use of Proprietary Information shall, unless agreed otherwise by the Parties, or unless such information becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the receiving party, remain in full force and effect a) for a period of five (5) years from expiration or termination of this Agreement when the disclosing party is a potential supplier to CAE, or b), for a period of twenty five years if the disclosing party is CAE. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party agrees to promptly return or destroy, as instructed by the disclosing party, any Proprietary Information received from the disclosing party, together with all copies thereof, upon request by the disclosing party, termination of the Agreement or expiry or termination of the Purpose, whichever is earlier. The recipient shall provide to the disclosing party, within ten (10) days of such request, expiry or termination, a certificate of one of its authorized senior corporate officer attesting to this return or destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one (1) copy may be retained in confidential restricted access files of the recipient\u2019s legal department for use by its legal counsel strictly in the event of a dispute.\n10. Each party shall bear its own costs incurred under or in connection with this Agreement.\n11. Nothing in this Agreement shall grant to a party the right to make any commitments of any kind for, or on behalf of, the other party without the prior written consent of such party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an obligation by a party to enter into a contract, subcontract or other business relationship with the other party.\n12. If any provision of this Agreement becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable regulation or law, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired.\n13. Any failure by a party to exercise any rights, power or privilege under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise of any right, power or privilege.\n14. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by a party without the prior written approval of the other party.\n15. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements and undertakings between the parties with respect to Proprietary Information supplied to each other, and is the complete agreement of the parties in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n16. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Quebec excluding its conflict of law rules and any applicable Federal laws of Canada.\n17. This Agreement may be signed in several counterparts, each of such counterparts so signed shall constitute an original, and all counterparts together shall constitute a single instrument. Any signature page delivered via facsimile transmission or electronic mail (pdf format) shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature page. Any party who delivers such a signature page agrees to subsequently deliver an original counterpart to any party that requests it.\n18. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be drafted in the English language.

"      MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into and made effective as of the later of the two signature dates below by and between (NAME OF COMPANY) (\u201cXYZ\u201d (ADDRESS OF COMPANY), and Tennessee Technological University, with its principal office at One William L. Jones Dr., Derryberry Hall 305, Cookeville, TN 38505 (\u201cTTU\u201d). WHEREAS, in connection with certain business discussions between XYZ and TTU, XYZ and TTU may disclose and reveal to each other, either orally, in writing or otherwise, certain materials, trade secrets, proprietary information and other confidential information relating directly or indirectly to their respective products and businesses.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the disclosure of Confidential Information (as defined below) by each party, the covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of all of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:\n1. Disclosure of Confidential Information.\n(a) For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any and all information (including, without limitation, all business, financial, commercial and technical information and data), in whatever form transmitted, whether tangible or intangible, that is disclosed, furnished or otherwise provided or made available by the disclosing party to the receiving party prior to or after the date of this Agreement. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes, without limitation, design documents, trade secrets, files, marketing and business plans, documentation, reports, projections, interpretations, forecasts, records (including information regarding the disclosing party\u2019s businesses, customers, strategies, operations, finances, technology, data, processes, methodologies, know-how, existing or future products, services, applications and methods of operation (including how such methods are developed, conducted or operated)) and all other information, whether in written, oral, encoded, electronic or other tangible or intangible form, and whether or not labeled, marked or otherwise identified as \u201cConfidential\u201d upon disclosure thereof, relating to the disclosing party\u2019s products and businesses, and any other information that would, if disclosed to any actual or potential competitors of the disclosing party, give or increase those competitors\u2019 advantage over the disclosing party or directly or indirectly harm the disclosing party\u2019s business.\n(b) Any trade secrets will be entitled to all of the protections and benefits of applicable trade secret laws and any other applicable laws. For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that information the disclosing party deems to be a trade secret is not a trade secret under applicable law, such information will nevertheless be deemed to be Confidential Information for purposes hereof, provided such information falls within the description set forth in Section 1(a).\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not mean information that, as demonstrated by the receiving party, is (i) in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement through no wrongful act of the receiving party or its agents or employees, (ii) independently developed by the receiving party without any use of, or reference to, Confidential Information, (iii) rightfully furnished to the receiving party by any third party without violation or breach of any confidentiality restriction, or (iv) authorized in writing for release by the disclosing party.\n2. Obligations Regarding Confidential Information.\n(a) Subject to the Tennessee Public Records Act, Section 10-7-5-1 et seq., at all times during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the receiving party shall:\n(i) refrain from disclosing, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information of the disclosing party to third parties, and hold all Confidential Information received from the disclosing party in trust and strict confidence, subject to the terms of this Agreement;\n(ii) take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information and avoid disclosure, loss or misuse of the Confidential Information; and\n(iii) refrain from using any of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information for any purpose not specified hereunder (including, without limitation, in its own business or for its own benefit) without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.\n(b) Subject to the Tennessee Public Records Act, Section 10-7-5-1 et seq.,without the written consent of the disclosing party, the receiving party will not disclose the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information to any person other than the receiving party\u2019s officers, directors, owners, employees, agents and representatives (i) with a valid need to know such Confidential Information and (ii) that have an enforceable agreement with the receiving party containing confidentiality obligations substantially similar to those terms and conditions applicable to the receiving party under this Agreement.\n(c) In the event that the receiving party is legally required to disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party, the receiving party shall give the disclosing party prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the disclosing party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the receiving party will reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party (at the disclosing party\u2019s expense) to obtain such protective order. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the disclosing party waives compliance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.\n(d) The receiving party shall give prompt written notice to the disclosing party upon discovery of any loss, misuse, misappropriation or disclosure of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information, and will reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party to help regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.\n(e) Upon the disclosing party\u2019s request, all documents, materials and other items containing the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information (including without limitation, all originals, copies, and reproductions of the Confidential Information) shall be promptly returned to the disclosing party without retaining a copy thereof, and the receiving party shall provide a certification, signed by an officer, as to the completeness of the return of such materials. Upon such request, the receiving party also shall destroy all documents, materials and other items embodying or summarizing the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information in whatever format, and shall provide a similar certification as to the completeness of the destruction of such materials. Compliance with this Subsection 2(e) shall not relieve the receiving party of its obligations under this Agreement.\n3. Ownership. The disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing party. No license under any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property or proprietary right is granted or implied to any information furnished by or on behalf of either party to the other party, whether or not Confidential Information. Each party acknowledges that the other party\u2019s Confidential Information is highly valuable, confidential and proprietary to the other party and has been developed through the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that maintaining the confidentiality of this Confidential Information is essential for the general successful operations of TTU and Company.\n4. Miscellaneous.\n(a) Neither the holding of discussions nor the exchange of material or Confidential Information shall be construed as (i) obligating a party to enter into any agreement with the other party hereto; (ii) a commitment or obligation by a party to develop, sell or contract with respect to any products or services offered by the other party; or (iii) a license, partnership or joint venture between the parties.\n(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that all Confidential Information is provided \u201cAS-IS\u201d and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding such Confidential Information\u2019s accuracy or completeness. Each party understands and agrees that neither party shall have any liability whatsoever to the other party relating to or resulting from such party\u2019s use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom.\n(c) This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee as executed and performed in that state without regard to conflicts of laws principles. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that a party may assign this Agreement without consent in the event of a sale of securities or assets, merger or change of control of such party. Any assignment in violation of this Subsection 4(d) shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against the successors and permitted assigns of each party to this Agreement.\n(d) Failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver thereof. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the extent permissible and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between the parties concerning the Confidential Information, and no modifications of this Agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof will be binding upon either party unless approved in writing by each party. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in \u201cportable document format\u201d (\u201c.pdf\u201d) form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.\n(e) This Agreement shall be deemed to have been drafted by each party hereto. This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of the drafting or preparation, and the parties expressly agree not to assert that any inference should be drawn against either party on the basis of which party drafted this Agreement.\n(g) Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement.\nCOMPANY TENNESSEE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY\nBy: By:\n(Authorized Signature)\nTitle: Title:\nDate:

Confidential Information.\na) \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all information both tangible and intangible of a Disclosing Party which relates, respectively, to the above identified subject matter, including, but not limited to, trade secrets, business and technical information and data, disclosed orally, visually, in writing, electronic media or by any other means, and that is marked in accordance with this Section 1.\nb) With respect to any tangible information that a Disclosing Party would like to be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall mark such information as \u201cConfidential\u201d prior to disclosing it to the Recipient.\nc) With respect to any oral or visual communication or other intangible information which a Disclosing Party would like to be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall notify Recipient of such fact at the time of disclosure and within fifteen (15) days thereafter, Disclosing Party shall send Recipient a written memorandum outlining the information deemed to be Confidential Information. Such memorandum shall be marked \u201cConfidential.\u201d\n2. Non-Disclosure. A Recipient of Confidential Information under this Agreement shall use the Confidential Information only for the purpose of evaluating a research relationship between the Parties and shall protect such Confidential Information from disclosure to others, using the same degree of care used to protect its own confidentiality or proprietary information of like importance. If necessary to effectuate the furthering of a potential research relationship, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information received under this Agreement to employees and/or consultants with a need to know, provided that any consultants are bound to protect such Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure under the terms of a written agreement. Confidential Information shall not otherwise be disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Neither Party shall use the Confidential Information of the other, in whole or in part, except as permitted under this Agreement.\n3. Exclusions.\na) \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include information that:\ni. was publicly known at the time of the Disclosing Party\u2019s communication thereof;\nii. becomes publicly known through no fault of Recipient subsequent to the time of Disclosing Party\u2019s communication thereof to Recipient;\niii. was in Recipient\u2019s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time of Disclosing Party\u2019s communication thereof to Recipient;\niv. is developed by Recipient independently of this Agreement without use or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information;\nv. is rightfully obtained by Recipient from a third party, provided the Recipient has no reason to believe that such third party was under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party.\nb) In the event Confidential Information of the other party is lawfully required to be disclosed by any governmental agency or otherwise required to be disclosed by law, it may be so disclosed without violation of this Agreement, but only to the extent required; provided however that before making such disclosure, Recipient shall give Disclosing Party reasonable prior written notice of such required disclosure so that Disclosing Party has an opportunity to interpose an objection and/or take action to ensure confidential handling of such information.\n4. Return of Information. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement (including without limitation information in computer software or held in electronic storage media) shall be and remain in the property of Disclosing Party. All such information in tangible form shall be returned to Disclosing Party promptly upon written request by Disclosing Party or the termination or expiration of this Agreement, whichever occurs first, and shall not thereafter be retained in any form by Recipient. In lieu of return, such information may be destroyed by the Recipient provided any such destruction shall be certified in writing to the Disclosing Party by one of Recipient\u2019s duly authorized officers. No intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret, are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement. Neither Party is obligated under this Agreement to purchase from or provide to the other Party any service or product or enter into any agreement.\n5. Duration of Confidentiality. The Recipient shall maintain in confidence and shall not disclose to any person not a party hereto, unless permitted to do so under Section 2, or use or exploit in any way, without the Disclosing Party\u2019s written agreement, any Confidential Information for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of such information, unless such information ceases to be Confidential Information prior to the end of such five-year period through no fault of Recipient, or Recipient and Disclosing Party enter into a written agreement authorizing same.\n6. No Warranty. Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty to Recipient as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it and shall not have any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.

No Relationship. This Agreement is intended to provide only for the handling and protection of Confidential Information. It shall not be construed as a teaming, joint venture, partnership or other similar arrangement.\n8. Injunctive Relief. The Parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information is a unique and valuable asset of Disclosing Party, and that disclosure in breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Disclosing Party for which monetary damages alone would not be an Non-disclosure Agreement \u2013 v. 1.0 adequate remedy. Therefore, the Parties agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality and/or of this agreement, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction prohibiting any such breach or to specific performance or other equitable relief as a remedy available to Disclosing Party. Any such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages.\n9. No Assignment. Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section will be void and of no effect.\n10. Entire Agreement.

Choice of Law and Venue. This Agreement and any actions under it shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. Any disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be heard in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania or the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of said courts and waives any objection which they may have at any time to the jurisdiction of such courts, the laying of venue in such courts or the convenience of the forum.\n12. Export Control. Each Party agrees that it will not directly or indirectly transmit, by way of trans-shipment, export, diversion or otherwise, any Confidential Information of the other Party except in accordance with any and all applicable United States export control laws and regulations. As an institution of higher learning, Carnegie Mellon generally performs fundamental research that is exempt from export control licensing under applicable export control laws. As a result, Carnegie Mellon typically does not wish to take receipt of export-controlled information, except as may be specifically agreed to by Carnegie Mellon and for which Carnegie Mellon has made specific arrangements. __________________ agrees that it will not provide or make accessible to Carnegie Mellon any export-controlled Confidential Information without first informing the Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Office of Sponsored Programs of the export-controlled nature of the Confidential Information and obtaining from Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Office of Sponsored Programs its written consent to accept such information as well as any specific instructions regarding the mechanism pursuant to which such information should be passed.\n13. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the Parties as expressed herein.\n14. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person or entity other than Carnegie Mellon and _________ any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.\n15. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement will be one (1) year from the Effective Date, unless it is terminated earlier by either party providing the other party with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, or unless it is extended as mutually agreed upon by the parties.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative as of the date first written above.\n____________________________________ CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nSignature:____________________________

"      MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d) is made between Conference of State Bank Supervisors, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d), and its affiliates and subsidiaries, whose principal offices are located at 1129 20th Street NW, Washington D.C. 20036 and <Vendor Name Here> whose principal offices are located at _________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________.\nIn consideration of each party\u2019s provision of access to certain confidential information by the other in order to permit the parties to discuss current and future potential business relationships and perform their obligations under a Professional Services Agreement or other agreements or projects between Company and <Vendor Name Here> (collectively, \u201cProject\u201d) and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged, it is agreed as follows:\n1. Each party may be provided with access to selected information (oral, written, or electronic) of the other which helps meet a regulatory purpose or business need, including, but not limited to, that information which relates or refers to: business planning; internal controls; computer, data processing, or communications architectures or systems; electronic data processing architectures, applications, programs, routines, or subroutines; business affairs and methods of operation or proposed methods of operations, techniques or systems of a party or any customer of a party, financial or other non-public information, including but not limited to proposals, processes, forecasts, ideas, concepts, projections, analyses, software, hardware, marketing information, documentation, structure and protocols. Some of the information in each of these categories is confidential in nature or constitutes a trade secret as it is not generally known to its competitors or the public. This information received from a party, either orally or in writing, during the course of the Project shall be deemed to be confidential information (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) for purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement. Notes, documents, summaries or reports which are prepared from Confidential Information to the extent such specifically refer or relate to Confidential Information are themselves Confidential Information.\n2. Each party acknowledges the sensitive and secret nature of the Confidential Information it will have access to during the term of the Project and agrees that it will treat such Confidential Information as strictly confidential and shall exercise the same degree of care in the protection of the Confidential Information as the receiving party exercises with respect to its own proprietary property and trade secrets, but in no event shall it be less than a reasonable degree of care given the nature of the Confidential Information.\n3. Neither party shall disclose the Confidential Information received from the other to any person or entity, except its employees, officers, directors, independent consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and other agents (collectively \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) involved in the performance of the Project, or to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations under the Project. Each party acknowledges and agrees that breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by the other and/or anyone employed by or otherwise associated with the other may also constitute a violation of applicable laws. Access to Confidential Information by the receiving party shall be limited to those Representatives who have agreed to be bound in writing under terms no less stringent than this Confidentiality Agreement.\n4. Neither party shall make copies of the Confidential Information except for those copies required for use by Authorized Persons in the performance of the Project. Each copy, including its storage media, shall be marked Confidential, and also include all copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices which appear on the original. Each party agrees that all Confidential Information of the other party, including any copies thereof, shall be returned to the disclosing party upon request or destroyed within ten (10) business days of the expiration or other termination of the Project. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, 1) neither party will be required to delete electronic Confidential Information stored in back-up/archival storage in accordance with its policies, provided that any such retained Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement until it is destroyed by the receiving party; and 2) a single copy of all Confidential Information may be retained by the Receiving Party\u2019s legal department for dispute resolution purposes only, provided, however, that such Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality Agreement. In the event that a receiving party has or acquires actual knowledge of any breach of the confidentiality of, or the misappropriation of, any Confidential Information received under this Confidentiality Agreement, such party shall promptly give notice thereof to the other party.\n5. Upon written demand by the disclosing party or upon termination of this Confidentiality Agreement, the receiving party shall: (i) cease using the Confidential Information, (ii) return the Confidential Information and all copies, notes or extracts thereof to the disclosing party within ten (10) business days of receipt of demand; and (iii) upon request of the disclosing party, certify in writing that the receiving party has complied with the obligations set forth in this paragraph. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, 1) neither party will be required to delete electronic Confidential Information stored in back-up/archival storage in accordance with its policies, provided that any such retained Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement until it is destroyed by the receiving party; and 2) a single copy of all Confidential Information may be retained by the Receiving Party\u2019s legal department for dispute resolution purposes only, provided, however, that such Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality Agreement.\n6. All intellectual property rights associated with the Confidential Information, including without limitation, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret rights, and moral rights shall remain in the disclosing party. Moreover, this Confidentiality Agreement does not grant any right or license to a party, by implication or otherwise, to any intellectual property owned or controlled by the other party.\n7. The obligation of non-disclosure shall not extend to: (1) information which is then already in the possession of the receiving party and not under a duty of non-disclosure; (2) information which is generally known or revealed to the public; (3) information which is revealed to the receiving party by a third party, unless such party is under a duty of non-disclosure; (4) information which the receiving party develops independently of the disclosure and such independent development can be shown by documentary evidence maintained contemporaneously with such development; or (5) information that is disclosed with the disclosing party\u2019s prior written consent.\n8. In the event that a party receives a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Confidential Information received from the other, the receiving party shall provide prompt actual notice to, in the case of <Vendor Name Here>, the General Counsel of <Vendor Name Here>, and, in the case of Company, to the General Counsel of Company, of such receipt, providing the party with a reasonable opportunity to intervene in the proceeding before the time that the other party is required to comply with such subpoena or other process. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the disclosing party waives compliance with the provision of this Confidentiality Agreement, the receiving party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the receiving party is legally required to disclose and shall exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything otherwise set forth herein, <Vendor Name Here> or Company may disclose Confidential Information: a) to the extent revealed to a government agency with regulatory or oversight jurisdiction over Company; or b) in the course of fulfilling any of <Vendor Name Here> regulatory responsibilities, including responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act) or other applicable law. In either case, <Vendor Name Here> or Company shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the receiving party is legally required to disclose and shall exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded the Confidential Information.\n9. Each party acknowledges that the other, because of the nature of the Confidential Information, would suffer irreparable harm in the event of a material breach of the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement in that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate for such a breach, and that in the event of any material breach or threatened material breach by a party receiving Confidential Information from the other party of any such provisions, a party shall be entitled, in addition to such other legal or equitable remedies which might be available, to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction against the threatened material breach or continuation of any such material breach without showing or proving any actual damages sustained by it. Moreover, any such award of relief to the discloser of such Confidential Information shall include recovery of all actual and reasonable costs associated with enforcement of this Agreement including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 fees.\n10. The Effective Date of this Confidentiality Agreement shall be the date it is signed by both parties and it shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days written notice of either party, or (ii) three (3) years after the effective date.\n11. The representations and obligations of each party relative to the Confidential Information shall survive the expiration or termination of this Confidentiality Agreement for a period of the longer of three (3) years or for such time as such Confidential Information remains a protectable trade secret under applicable law.\n12. The rights and obligations of the parties hereunder are in addition to, and not in derogation of, their respective rights and duties under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\u201cUTSA\u201d) as adopted in the state set forth below or in respective state\u2019s trade secrets laws, if UTSA has not been adopted.\n13. This Confidentiality Agreement contains the full and complete understanding of Company and <Vendor Name Here> with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior representations and understandings whether they be oral or written.\n14. Company and <Vendor Name Here> understand and agree that in the event any part, term or provision of this Confidentiality Agreement is held to be invalid or legally unenforceable, the validity of the remaining parts, terms or provisions shall not be affected, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Confidentiality Agreement did not contain the particular part, term, or provision held to be invalid. This Confidentiality Agreement and performance thereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of laws rules.\n15. The parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information disclosed by each of them under this Confidentiality Agreement may be subject to export controls under the laws of the United States. Each party shall comply with such laws and agrees not to knowingly export, re-export or transfer Confidential Information of the other party without first obtaining all required United States authorizations or licenses.\n16. Neither party may assign this Confidentiality Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may assign or transfer this Confidentiality Agreement and its rights hereunder to an affiliate or successor to its assets or liabilities if such assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof and the non-assignment party is given notice of such an assignment. Any assignment to the contrary shall be void.\n17. The persons executing this Confidentiality Agreement warrant that they have the authority to bind <Vendor Name Here> and Company to the terms and conditions embodied in this Confidentiality Agreement.\n18. Neither party makes or intends to make any warranty or representation of any kind concerning the Confidential Information, except each party represents and warrants that it has the right to disclose Confidential Information to Receiving Party. Confidential Information is provided only for discussion purposes, is provided on an \u201cAs Is\u201d basis, and Receiving Party relies on Confidential Information at its own risk.\n19. As used in this Confidentiality Agreement, the terms \u201c<Vendor Name Here>\u201d and Company shall include any of their respective corporate affiliates or subsidiaries, provided that <Vendor Name Here> and Company (a) shall be responsible for the observance and proper performance by all of their respective corporate affiliates of the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) if requested by the disclosing party, shall cause such corporate affiliate to return or destroy all Confidential Information in accordance with Section 5, prior to a corporate affiliate ceasing to be an affiliate thereof.\n20. Independent Development: This Confidentiality Agreement shall not be construed to limit the Receiving Party\u2019s, or any of its Representatives\u2019, right to independently develop or acquire products, services, or technology without use of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party understands and acknowledges that the Receiving Party and/or its Representatives may currently or in the future be developing information, knowledge or technology internally, or obtaining information, knowledge or technology from other persons that may be similar to information, knowledge or technology contained or reflected in the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n21.

As a condition to furnishing such information to Buyer, the Company and Buyer hereby agree to the following provisions:4\n1. Certain Definitions. As used in this letter agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d):\n(a) \u201cAffiliate\u201d means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that is directly or indirectly Controlling, Controlled by or under common Control with such Person, where \u201cControl\u201d and derivative terms mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. [Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of Section 7, any such Person that is a portfolio company of, or an investment fund that is advised or managed by, [Buyer] [Buyer\u2019s Parent Company] or any of its Affiliates shall not be considered an Affiliate of Buyer unless Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure is made available or actually provided or disclosed to such Person by or on behalf of Buyer; provided that Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure shall not be deemed to have been made available or actually provided or disclosed to any such Person solely as a result of the fact that a Representative of the Buyer with knowledge of any Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure is serving on the board of directors (or similar governing body) or as an officer of such Person.]5\n(b) \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means any information or data concerning the Company or any of its Affiliates, whether in oral, visual, written, electronic or other form, that is disclosed to Buyer or any of its Representatives [before the date hereof,]6 now or in the future by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives, together with all notes, memoranda, forecasts, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings relating thereto that are prepared by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Representatives to the extent that they use, contain, reflect or are derived from or incorporate, in whole or in part, any such information or data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include any information or data that: (i) is or was independently developed by Buyer or any of its Representatives without the benefit of any Evaluation Material;7 (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its Representatives in breach of this Agreement; (iii) is or becomes available to Buyer [on a non-confidential basis]8 from a source other than the Company or any of its Representatives, so long as that source[, to Buyer\u2019s knowledge after reasonable inquiry,]9 is not bound by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company; or (iv) is already in Buyer\u2019s possession at the time of disclosure by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Representatives[ as shown by Buyer\u2019s records immediately prior to the time of disclosure]10 from a source other than the Company or any of its Representatives, so long as that source[, to Buyer\u2019s knowledge after reasonable inquiry,]11 is not bound by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company.\n(c) \u201cincluding\u201d means \u201cincluding, without limitation.\u201d\n(d) \u201cPerson\u201d means any natural person, business, corporation, company, association, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, business enterprise, trust, governmental authority or other legal entity.\n(e) \u201cRepresentatives\u201d means, with respect to any Person, the Affiliates of such Person and any of its and their respective directors, officers, employees, managing members, general partners, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors, consultants and other advisors[, and any actual or potential sources of debt financing for such Person or its Affiliates]12; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any actual or potential sources of equity financing for Buyer or its Affiliates be considered a \u201cRepresentative\u201d of Buyer for purposes of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company.\n2. Confidentiality, Use and Disclosure of Evaluation Material.\n(a) Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material. Buyer agrees that Buyer and its Representatives shall (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and consummating the Transaction (or other legal, audit or compliance purposes permitted by this Agreement);13 (ii) except as otherwise permitted by this Section 2, keep all Evaluation Material strictly confidential; and (iii) disclose Evaluation Material only to Representatives of Buyer to whom disclosure is needed to facilitate the evaluation, negotiation and/or consummation of the Transaction. Before Buyer or any of its Representatives provides access to any Evaluation Material to any of its Representatives, Buyer agrees that it or one of its Representatives shall inform such Representative of the provisions of this Agreement and instruct it to comply with the provisions hereof applicable to its Representatives. Buyer shall be liable for any breaches of this Agreement by its Representatives, except for breaches committed by any Representative that is party to either (a) a separate joinder agreement in the form set forth as Exhibit C hereto or (b) a separate mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement between such Representative and the Company with respect to the Evaluation Material.\n(b) Discussions Disclosure. Without the prior written consent of the Company, neither the Buyer nor any of its Representatives shall: (i) make any disclosure to any other Person (other than its Representatives to whom disclosure is needed to facilitate the evaluation, negotiation and/or consummation of the Transaction) of (A) the fact that investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, (C) the fact that Buyer or any of its Representatives has requested or received Evaluation Material, conducted due diligence or attended management meetings or site visits with the Company or any of its Representatives or is otherwise considering the Transaction or (D) any of the terms, conditions or facts relating to the Transaction, including the status thereof; or (ii) make any public statement concerning the Transaction. Without the prior written consent of Buyer, neither the Company nor any of its Representatives shall make any disclosure to any other Person (other than its Representatives) of the fact that Buyer or any of its Representatives has requested or received Evaluation Material, conducted due diligence or attended management meetings or site visits with the Company or any of its Representatives or is otherwise considering the Transaction (other than on an anonymous basis) or any other information that may reasonably be expected to lead to disclosure of Buyer\u2019s identity (any disclosure or statement prohibited by the two preceding sentences being \u201cDiscussions Disclosure\u201d).\n(c) Compulsory Disclosure.\n(i) If Buyer or any of its Representatives or the Company or any of its Representatives (in the case of Discussions Disclosure) is requested or required by interrogatories, requests for information from a governmental, regulatory or supervisory authority, deposition, subpoena or similar legal process to disclose any Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure, or disclosure of Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure is required [based on the advice of counsel]14 for Buyer or any of its Representatives or the Company or any of its Representatives in order not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation, order or other similar requirement of any governmental, regulatory or supervisory authority or any applicable listing agreement (collectively, \u201cApplicable Law\u201d and such required disclosing party, the \u201cCompulsory Disclosing Party\u201d), the Compulsory Disclosing Party shall provide the other party with prompt prior written notice thereof, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or, in the sole discretion of the other party, waive compliance by the Compulsory Disclosing Party with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.\n(ii) If, in the absence of such a protective order or waiver, the Compulsory Disclosing Party is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose any Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure [based on the advice of counsel], then the Compulsory Disclosing Party may, without liability under this Agreement, disclose only such portion of the Evaluation Material or make only such Discussions Disclosure as is legally required to be disclosed [based on the advice of counsel]; provided that the Compulsory Disclosing Party agrees to use reasonable efforts, at the other party\u2019s expense, to obtain assurances that any such disclosed Evaluation Material and Discussions Disclosure will be afforded confidential treatment.\n(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, none of Buyer or any of its Representatives shall be permitted to make any disclosure of Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure if Buyer or any of its Representatives has, without the prior written consent of the Company\u2019s board of directors, initiated any proxy contest, tender offer, other effort to enter into a business combination with the Company, or any plan or proposal described in Item 4 of Schedule 13D, or taken any other action in violation of Section 8, that would reasonably be expected to trigger such requirement of disclosure.15\n(iv) The Company acknowledges that Buyer has advised the Company that [Buyer is, and] certain of its Representatives may be, registered investment advisers or regulated financial institutions and thus subject to routine examinations, investigations, regulatory sweeps or other regulatory inquiries. Buyer and its Representatives shall not be required to comply with the process described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above in respect of disclosures made to a regulatory agency, self-regulatory organization, governmental agency or examiner thereof in the course of any such routine examinations, investigations, sweeps or inquiries, and any such disclosure shall be permitted.\n(d) Disclosure Permitted to Defend Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2, Buyer or any of its Representatives and the Company or any of its Representatives (in the case of Discussions Disclosure) may disclose Evaluation Material or Discussions Disclosure to the extent necessary to defend any litigation claim or cause of action brought against it by the other party relating to the Transaction; provided that the disclosing party agrees to use (and to cause its applicable Representatives to use) reasonable efforts, at the other party\u2019s expense, to obtain assurances that any such disclosed Evaluation Material and Discussions Disclosure will be afforded confidential treatment.\n3. [Securities Law Restrictions. 16 Buyer acknowledges that: (a) the Evaluation Material and information that, if disclosed, would constitute Discussions Disclosure may contain material non-public information concerning the Company and its Affiliates; and (b) Buyer is aware of the restrictions imposed by U.S. federal and state securities laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, on Persons in possession of material non-public information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either party that any Evaluation Material or other such information in fact contains material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Affiliates.]17\n4. No Representations or Warranties. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by the Company or any of its Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Evaluation Material; and (b) Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties that are expressly set forth in any definitive written agreement that is hereafter executed and delivered by both Buyer or its Affiliate and the Company in connection with the Transaction (a \u201cDefinitive Transaction Agreement\u201d). Except as may be expressly set forth in a Definitive Transaction Agreement, none of the Company or any of its Representatives shall have any liability to Buyer or any of its Representatives on account of the use of any Evaluation Material by Buyer or any of its Representatives or any inaccuracy therein or omission therefrom.\n5. Destruction or Erasure of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the Company\u2019s written request (including by email), Buyer agrees that Buyer and its Representatives shall promptly destroy or erase all Evaluation Material (including any Evaluation Material held electronically) in the possession or control of Buyer or any of its Representatives, and Buyer shall, if requested in writing (including by email) by the Company, certify such destruction or erasure to the Company; provided that (a) neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives shall be required to destroy or erase any electronic copy of any Evaluation Material that is created pursuant to such Person\u2019s standard electronic backup and archival procedures if (x) personnel whose functions are not primarily information technology in nature do not have access to such retained copies and (y) personnel whose functions are primarily information technology in nature have access to such copies only as reasonably necessary for the performance of their information technology duties (e.g., for purposes of system recovery) and [(b) Buyer and its Representatives may each retain (i) one copy of any Evaluation Material to the extent required to defend or maintain any litigation relating to this Agreement or the Evaluation Material, or to comply with its established document retention policies and (ii) such copies of the Evaluation Material to the extent required to comply with requirements of Applicable Law.]18 All such Evaluation Material retained in accordance with the foregoing proviso shall continue to be subject to Section 2 [for so long as any Evaluation Material is so retained].19\n6. Communications Regarding the Transaction. Buyer agrees that all communications by it or any of its Representatives with the other Party concerning the Transaction and its due diligence investigation (including requests for additional Evaluation Material, meetings with management and site visits) shall be directed solely to [___________________], except as may otherwise be approved in advance and in writing (including by email) by the Company. Buyer agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Representatives will contact or communicate with any of the directors, officers, employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, licensees, licensors and clients of the Company, and other persons, including governmental agencies, having business relations with the Company, regarding the Company or the Transaction, in each case except to the extent such contacts and communications are (i) made in the ordinary course of business of Buyer or the applicable Representatives and are unrelated to the Transaction and the evaluation of the Transaction conducted by Buyer and its Representatives or (ii) approved in advance and in writing (including by email) by the Company.20\n7. [No Solicitation or Hiring. Buyer agrees that, except with the prior written consent of the Company, it will not, and it will not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any [employees/officers/senior management of the Company [first introduced to Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates in connection with the evaluation of the Transaction][that first become known to Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates in connection with Buyer\u2019s evaluation of the Transaction][listed on Exhibit A]] for a period of [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement; provided that this Section 7 shall not restrict Buyer or any of its controlled Affiliates from (i) making any general solicitation for employment that is not specifically directed at any such Persons, including through use of a recruiting website or employment search firm (so long as the firm is not instructed to solicit such Persons) or from hiring any Person as a result thereof or (ii) soliciting or hiring any such Person who [has left the employment of the Company][was terminated by the Company] at least [___] months prior to such solicitation or being hired.21\n8.

Remedies. Each party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without the posting of a bond or other security, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.26 Such injunctive or other equitable relief shall be available without the obligation to prove any damages underlying such breach or threatened breach. [In the event of any legal proceedings for the enforcement of this Agreement, the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party and its Representatives as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with such proceedings, including attorney fees and disbursements, shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party.]\n10. No Waiver of Privilege. To the extent that any Evaluation Material includes materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, such disclosure is inadvertent and the Company is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing any Evaluation Material (including Evaluation Material related to pending or threatened litigation) to Buyer or any of its Representatives.\n11.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the subsequent use by such Representative of such general knowledge, skills and experience, as retained in their unaided memories, will not in itself constitute a breach of this Agreement.27\n12. Term. Except for Sections 13(i) (Governing Law; Forum), 13(j) (WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL) and 13(k) (Conflict Waiver), which shall be binding in perpetuity or until the latest date permitted by Applicable Law, [the last sentence of Section 5]28 and Sections 7 and 8 which shall survive in accordance with their respective terms, this Agreement shall expire upon the date that is [___] year[s] after the date of this Agreement.29\n13.

The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by any offering memorandum, web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which Buyer or any of its Representatives is granted access in connection with the evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, \u201cclicking\u201d on an \u201cI Agree\u201d icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that the confidentiality obligations with respect to Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except in accordance with Section 13(f).\n(c) Ownership of Evaluation Material; No License. All Evaluation Material is and shall remain property of the Company. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company nor any of its Representatives grants any license to or other property right or interest in, by implication or otherwise, any copyright, patent, trademark, mask work, database or other intellectual or intangible property or proprietary information disclosed, embodied, fixed, comprised or contained in any Evaluation Material.\n(d) No Financing Exclusivity. Buyer hereby represents and warrants that it is not party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether written or oral) that would restrict the ability of any other person to provide financing (debt, equity or otherwise) to any other person for the Transaction or any similar transaction, and Buyer hereby agrees that it will not directly or indirectly restrict the ability of any other person to provide any such financing.\n(e) Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void and unenforceable.\n(f) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Buyer and the Company. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n(g) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, unless the enforcement of such other provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.\n(h) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement or impose any obligation on either party to (i) consummate a Transaction, (ii) conduct or continue discussions or negotiations concerning a Transaction, (iii) enter into a joint venture or other business relationship of any kind or (iv) enter into or negotiate a Definitive Transaction Agreement. Except with respect to the matters specifically set forth herein, neither party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression by the parties or their respective Representatives unless and until a Definitive Transaction Agreement is executed and delivered. Buyer acknowledges that the Company reserves the right to (A) provide or not provide Evaluation Material to, and request the destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material by, Buyer or any of its Representatives, (B) reject any proposals made by Buyer or any of its Representatives, (C) terminate discussions or negotiations with Buyer or any of its Representatives and (D) engage in discussions and/or negotiations, and to enter into any agreement, with any other Person, in each case in the Company\u2019s sole discretion, without notice to Buyer or any of its Representatives, at any time and for any reason or no reason. Buyer shall not have any claim or cause of action against the Company or any of its Representatives in respect of the foregoing, except as specifically set forth in any Definitive Transaction Agreement, if any, that is hereafter executed.\n(i) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of [New York]31 without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws in any jurisdiction. Each party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the [State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and the courts of the United States located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City in the State of New York] for the adjudication of any action or legal proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each party agrees not to commence any action or legal proceeding relating thereto except in any such court). Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in such courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or legal proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. certified mail addressed to such party at the address set forth above (or such other address as notified by either party to the other party in writing) shall be effective service of process for any such suit, action or proceeding brought against such party in any such court. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose jurisdiction such party is or may be subject by suit upon such judgment.\n(j) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n(k) Conflict Waiver. This Agreement also constitutes notice to Buyer that the Company has engaged [LAW FIRM] as its legal counsel in connection with the Transaction, and Buyer hereby (i) consents to the continued representation of the Company by [LAW FIRM] in connection with the Transaction notwithstanding the fact that [LAW FIRM] may have represented, and may currently or in the future represent, Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates with respect to unrelated matters and (ii) waives any actual or alleged conflict and actual or alleged violation of ethical or comparable rules applicable to [LAW FIRM] that may arise from its representation of the Company in connection with the Transaction, including but not limited to representing the Company against Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates (or any Person acting on behalf of or in concert with Buyer or any such Affiliates who receives Evaluation Material from Buyer and/or its Representatives) in litigation, arbitration or mediation in connection therewith.

The Parties shall make all reasonable, necessary or appropriate efforts to safeguard the Confidential Information from disclosure to anyone other than as permitted hereby.\n3. Information or concepts which are discussed by either Party as an extrapolation of the Confidential Information disclosed are the property of the topic's disclosing Party.

"      EICA \u201cNon-Disclosure Agreement\u201d\nWHEREAS, Electrical Industry Certifications Association (EICA) wishes to protect its Con\ufb01dential Information, as de\ufb01ned below, against any unauthorized use and any unauthorized or uncontrolled disclosure.\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and suf\ufb01ciency of which is acknowledged, EICA and signee agree as follows:\nA. As used throughout this Agreement, the term \u201cCon\ufb01dential Information\u201d means information not generally known to third parties and which is proprietary to EICA including information about EICA\u2019s proprietary test items and item bank questions used for EICA\u2019s certification programs, test scoring criteria for written and practical exams and other business affairs of EICA relating to the management, development, and administration of certification programs and exams. All information, oral or written, of EICA that is disclosed to Signee or to which Signee obtains access, whether originated by Signee or by the discloser or others, shall be presumed to be Con\ufb01dential Information.\nB. As used throughout this Agreement, the acronym \u201cEICA\u201d means the Electrical Industry Certifications Association.\nC. It is understood that unauthorized disclosure or use, whether intentional or unintentional, of any of the Con\ufb01dential Information would be detrimental to EICA and could seriously affect the fairness of EICA\u2019s certification programs and certification exams. Accordingly, Signee agrees:\n1. Not to use any of the Con\ufb01dential Information for any purpose other than for or in connection with the Authorized Purpose.\n2. To maintain all of the Con\ufb01dential Information in con\ufb01dence and not to disclose any portion of the Con\ufb01dential Information to any person or entity not authorized hereunder without the prior written consent of EICA.\n3. That, upon EICA\u2019s request, all records, any compositions, articles, documents and other items which contain, disclose and/or embody any Con\ufb01dential Information (including, without limitation, all copies, reproductions, summaries and notes of the contents thereof), regardless of the person causing the same to be in such form, shall be returned to EICA or destroyed by Signee, and Signee will certify that the provisions of this paragraph have been complied with.\nD. The obligations pursuant to Section C above shall not apply to information which:\n1. Is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of Signee;\n2. Can be shown to be already possessed by Signee as of the date of disclosure;\n3. Shall be made available to Signee on a non---con\ufb01dential basis by a third party having a right to do so;\n4. Is disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or\n5. EICA authorizes, in writing, for release.\nE. In the event that Signee or its representatives receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Con\ufb01dential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body, the receiving party agrees to:\n1. Immediately notify EICA of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that EICA may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive Signee\u2019s compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and\n2. If disclosure of the Con\ufb01dential Information is required in the opinion of Signee\u2019s counsel, to the extent possible cooperate with EICA in obtaining reliable assurances that con\ufb01dential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed Con\ufb01dential Information.\nF. The parties acknowledge that the Con\ufb01dential Information is the property of EICA, and the disclosure of the Con\ufb01dential Information to Signee does not convey any right, title or license in the Con\ufb01dential Information to Signee. Signee shall not appropriate the Con\ufb01dential Information to Signee\u2019s own use or to the use of any third party and shall only use the Con\ufb01dential Information for the exclusive bene\ufb01t of EICA except to the extent otherwise authorized in writing by EICA.\nG. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by EICA in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this Agreement.\nH. The termination of the discussions or relationship between the parties shall not relieve Signee or its employees, agents or af\ufb01liates of the obligations of nonuse or nondisclosure under this Agreement or the obligation to return or destroy certain materials.\nI. The parties agree that money damages would not be suf\ufb01cient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the non---breaching party shall be entitled to enforce this Agreement by injunctive and other available relief, including without limitation speci\ufb01c performance.\nJ. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Utah. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. All obligations of the receiving party and rights of the disclosing party expressed in this Agreement shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, those provided by applicable law. This Agreement may be modi\ufb01ed or waived only by a separate writing by Signee and EICA expressly so modifying or waiving such. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. References to EICA and Signee shall be deemed to include each of their af\ufb01liates, if any. Any disputes arising out of this Agreement shall be adjudicated in federal or state district court in the State of Utah and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such court. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their successors and assigns.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties acknowledge their agreement to the foregoing as of the date \ufb01rst set forth

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Confidential Information that constitutes a Trade Secret, the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement shall survive as long as the information disclosed continues to constitute a Trade Secret under applicable law.\n7. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any information furnished to the Receiving Party or its Representatives, whether oral, written or visual, and regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party or its Representative, and shall include, without limitation:\na) information constituting a \""Trade Secret\"", as defined in Idaho Code, Title 48, Chapter 8; Idaho Trade Secrets Act, as amended from time to time, and will include technical or non-technical data, a formal, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a software program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, non-public forecasts, studies, projections, analyses, all customer data of any kind, or a list of actual or potential customers or suppliers, business and contractual relationships, or any information similar to the foregoing which (i) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known and not readily ascertainable by proper means to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. Trade Secrets will include any information meeting the foregoing criteria which belongs to third parties and which the Disclosing Party under this Agreement is obligated to hold in confidence;\nb) the non-public financial statements of a party;\nc) any confidential and proprietary information which the Disclosing Party obtains from another person or entity under an obligation of confidence and which the Disclosing Party treats as proprietary; and\nd) any valuable, secret business information, other than Trade Secrets, including but not limited to all specifications, drawings, sketches, models, samples, reports, plans, forecasts, and all other technical, financial or business data that is designated or identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or by its nature is clearly recognizable as confidential information to a reasonably prudent person with knowledge of the Disclosing Party\u2019s business and industry\nAll information or material that is disclosed by a Disclosing Party to a Receiving Party before, on or after the date hereof shall only be protected as Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party: (i) if in writing other tangible form, such information is marked as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary; (ii) if oral or in other intangible form, such information or material is identified to the Receiving Party in writing as confidential or proprietary within sixty (60) days of the date of such disclosure; or (iii) if due to the character or nature of such information or material, a reasonable person receiving such information or material under like circumstances would believe that Disclosing Party considered such information or material proprietary or confidential.\n8. Exceptions. The confidentiality obligations under this Agreement shall not apply to, and the term \""Confidential Information\"" shall specifically not include:\na) information which was, or at any time becomes, available in the public domain through no wrongful act of the Recipient or Recipient's Representatives;\nb) information which is already in the Receiving Party\u2019s lawful possession (as shown by written records) prior to the first disclosure of such information to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives, provided such information is not subject to another confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of secrecy to the Disclosing Party or another party;\nc) information which is documented by the Recipient as having been developed independently by it without use, directly or indirectly, of the information received from such Disclosing Party or its Representatives; and\nd) information which is documented by the Recipient as having been lawfully acquired by the Recipient from a source other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of secrecy to the Disclosing Party or another party.\n With regard to clause (a) above, the fact that certain information is in the public domain shall not affect the status of other information, which is not in the public domain, as Confidential Information hereunder, nor shall it cause such other information to be deemed to be in the public domain merely because such public domain information is embodied therein.\n9. Equitable Remedy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) the covenants in this Agreement are reasonable under the circumstances and are necessary to protect the Parties and the property of such Parties; and (ii) the breach by one Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement would cause serious and irreparable harm to the other Party that could not be adequately remedied by monetary damages alone. Each Party, therefore, consents to an order specifically enforcing the provisions of this Agreement or an order being issued against such Party enjoining or restraining it from any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, and agrees that such orders may be issued against such Party without the necessity of an undertaking as to damages or posting of bond by the Party seeking such orders. The Provisions of this Section 9 shall not derogate from any other remedy available at law or in equity that one Party may be entitled in the event of breach hereunder by the other Party.\n10. Requests for Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the confidentiality obligations imposed on each Party hereunder shall not apply to Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure of such information is required under applicable law, regulation or legal process; provided however, that, in the event the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are required by applicable law, regulation or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, prior to making such disclosure, the Receiving Party or its Representatives, as applicable shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such required disclosure as promptly as possible so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in its sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained before disclosure is required or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Receiving Party or its Representative, as applicable, shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is advised by counsel to be legally required and will request that the applicable legal authority hold the Confidential Information in confidence. Further, in such case, the Disclosing Party shall be given an opportunity to review the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to be disclosed by the Recipient prior to its disclosure.\n11. No Representation. Each Party understands and acknowledges that no representation or warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, is made as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information provided by either Party, and neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its affiliates, Representatives, directors, officers, equity owners, managers, employees or agents shall have any liability to the Recipient or to any other person or entity resulting from use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.\n12. No Commitment. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as committing the Parties hereto to enter into any business relationship between the Parties.\n13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements, arrangements, and understandings with respect thereto. No representation, promise, inducement, statement or intention has been made by any party hereto that is not embodied herein, and no party shall be bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise, inducement, or statement not so set forth herein.\n14. Modification. Except as permitted in Section 21 below (unilaterally changing its address), this Agreement may be modified, amended, superseded, or cancelled only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties hereto, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party to be bound by any such waiver.\n15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such prohibition or unenforceability shall not invalidate the remaining provisions thereof or affect the validity or enforceability of such provisions in any other jurisdiction.\n16. Governing Law/Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho, determined without regard to conflicts of law principles. Each Party expressly submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court in Coeur D\u2019Alene, Idaho, or alternatively, to the jurisdiction of the First Judicial District Court of Kootenai County, Idaho.\n17. Independent Advice from Counsel. Each of the Parties has received independent legal advice from legal counsel of their choice with respect to the advisability of entering into this Agreement and its terms or has knowingly and voluntarily waived its right to do so. The terms of this Agreement are the result of mutual negotiations between the parties, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with their fair meanings, and not strictly for or against either party, regardless of which Party may have drafted this Agreement.\n18. Waiver.

To guarantee confidentiality on both sides, the contractual partners hereby agree as follows:\n1. Duty of confidentiality\nThe contractual partners undertake to treat confidentially any information they obtain, to use it only for the intended purpose of the particular assignment or project and not to make it directly or indirectly accessible to third parties. Furthermore, they undertake to place a duty of confidentiality on their employees and any sub-contractors that correspond to the one contained in this Agreement.\nThe duty of confidentiality does not apply to information\n- that the receiving contractual partner was already in possession of when the information was passed on,\n- that was published when or after it was disclosed without being in breach of this Non-Disclosure Agreement,\n- that a contractual partner received legally from a third party where there was no duty of confidentiality,\n- that a contractual partner develops independently of the confidential information after this Agreement has come into force,\n- that a contractual partner has released as a result of a written agreement with the other contractual partner.\n2. Definition of information under this Agreement\nInformation under this Agreement is defined as any data or knowledge from Bomatec or the Business Partner that Bomatec has made or will make available to the Business Partner, or vice versa, in verbal, written or electronic form or in the form of one or several objects, irrespective of whether such data and knowledge was designated as confidential or secret.\nBomatec retains all rights to its data, information and objects.\n3. Restriction on access and dissemination\nThe contractual partners shall restrict the distribution of and access to information they exchange to those persons who need the information to reasonably carry out the planned activity. They shall ensure that access to this information, including information in electronic form in particular, is adequately protected.\nThe contractual partners may only disseminate copies of information, data and data storage media to sub-contractors with the prior approval of an authorized signatory of the other contractual partner.\n4. Destruction of documents and saved information\nUpon completion of an assignment or project, the contractual partners undertake to destroy immediately any information or objects given to them that they or any sub-contractors may have, unless such information and property are required for any outstanding or future follow-up activities under the mutual business partnership. The destruction of information in electronic form also applies to e-mails, data storage media such as USB sticks, local hard disks, servers and back-up copies.\n5. Returning of documents and/or objects\nIf specifically requested by Bomatec, the Business Partner must return to Bomatec any documents or objects it was given during the collaboration and vice versa.\n6. Duration of the Agreement\nThis agreement shall take effect as soon as it has been signed by both parties and shall be valid for the duration of the collaboration or until this agreement is replaced by another agreement. The obligation to confidentiality shall apply for a period of two years beyond the end of the collaboration.\n7. Restriction on using Bomatec as reference\nThe Business Partner and any sub-contractors may only mention to third parties the Bomatec company name (including illustrated material in connection with Bomatec) as well as activities carried out during the collaboration with Bomatec after the prior written approval of Bomatec\u2019s Executive Board.\nThis also applies to publications in information journals, company presentations, entries in Internet documents, etc.\nApproval only applies to the current assignment or project and should be sought from Bomatec by the Business Partner on every occasion that collaboration is repeated.\n8.

Written form\nChanges or additions to this Agreement (including the waiver of this provision) must be made in writing.\n10. Severability clause, applicable law and jurisdiction\nIn the event that one or more of the clauses of this Agreement should prove to be ineffective or should this Agreement contain a disparity, the legal effectiveness of the other provisions shall not thereby be affected. A valid provision that comes closest to the intended purpose of the ineffective provision shall be agreed to replace it.\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be governed by Swiss substantive law. Z\u00fcrich, canton of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland shall be the place of jurisdiction.\n11.

Such remedies shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n7. Waiver and Severability. It is understood that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall constitute waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n8. Non-disclosure Agreement Only. This Agreement shall not constitute, create, give effect to, or otherwise imply a joint venture, pooling agreement, partnership, or formal business organization of any kind. The exchange of Confidential Information does not constitute a business offer, an acceptance, or promise for any future contract or amendment to any existing contract between the parties. Each party represents that the individual signing below has been given, and does have, the requisite authority to legally bind the party represented by that individual.\n9. Modification. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and cannot be modified, released, discharged, abandoned, or otherwise terminated in whole or in part unless approved in writing. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to do so shall be void, provided, however, that either party shall be permitted to assign this agreement to any purchaser of all or substantially all of such party\u2019s assets or equity interests, without consent, provided such purchaser agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions contained herein.\n10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws, and in the courts, of the State of Ohio, County of Lake, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors, permitted assigns, and Representatives of the parties hereto. All notices under this Agreement must be in writing addressed to the address first listed above, or at such other address as may be provided by such party from time to time. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.\n11. Term. This Agreement shall become effective upon execution by the parties and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of two (2) years from the date thereof, provided however, that the obligations of the parties contained herein shall continue for a period of five (5) years following the date of such termination.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of this ___ day of __________, 201__.\nChemsultants International, Inc.

Employee\u2019s and agents of the Company shall only be given access to the Confidential Information in order to proceed with the Services.\n2. The Company undertakes to treat all Confidential Information not in the public domain that it may become a party to as a result of providing the Services to the Client and its associates, including the existence of the request for the Services, the names of the parties involved and any information contained in or which otherwise reflects the information in the documentation received from the Client, as confidential. The Company further undertakes that such Information shall not be disclosed to a third party, save as provided in Clause 4 below, without the prior written consent of the Client.\n3. The Company hereby discloses that it may subcontract all or part of the Services provided to the Client. In such event the Company will use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that all of its Subcontractors, to whom disclosure of the Information is made, act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as if each were a party hereto. Any third party to whom Confidential Information is provided shall be informed of the confidential nature of the information disclosed.\n4. The parties agree that information is not to be regarded as Confidential Information and that the Company will have no obligation with respect to any information which the Company can demonstrate:\n4.1 is publicly available at the time of disclosure;\n4.2 is or becomes known to the public through no wrongful act of the Company;\n4.3 is used or disclosed with the prior written authorisation of the Client; or\n4.4 is disclosed by the Company in compliance with a legal requirement of a government agency or otherwise where disclosure is required by operation of law.\n5.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nBOOSTER Precision Components GmbH\nW\u00f6hlerstra\u00dfe 8-10\n60323 Frankfurt am Main\nGermany\nPlace, Date, Signature, Stamp\nRECITALS:\nBoth Contract Partners intend to exchange information, documents (including expert opinions, notes, correspondence, evaluations, and conclusions), data and/or knowledge \u2013 regardless whether these be transmitted verbally, in writing or electronically \u2013 as well as prototypes and prototype components which may have already been manufactured (hereinafter commonly referred to as \u201cInformation\u201d) which the disclosing party (\u201cDiscloser\u201d) concerned considers to be worthy of being protected and treated confidentially. The exchange of information serves to evaluate the possibility of a supply relationship between the Contract Partners (\u201cPurpose of Exchange\u201d). In order to enable the non-disclosure and the exchange of information the Contract Partners agree as follows:\nThe Contract Partners undertake to keep the Information in accordance with the detailed provisions of this contract as disclosed by the other Contract Partner secure and take the necessary precautions to ensure that third parties have no access to the Information and that the Information is not disclosed to third parties.\n1. The Contract Partner receiving the Information (\u201eRecipient \u201c) will not disclose the Information received to third parties or use the Information for own business purposes for any other purpose except the Purpose of Exchange, without first obtaining the written agreement of the Discloser. This applies explicitly also to the use of Information for the purpose of registering patents, brands, and other intellectual property. The Recipient will ensure that the Information is only disclosed to those employees who need to know the same for the Purpose of Exchange and who explicitly know they owe a duty of confidence to the Discloser and who are bound by obligations equivalent to those in clauses 1 and 2. The Discloser may request from the Recipient a non-disclosure obligation of the employee at any time.\n2. The aforementioned non-disclosure obligation and restriction of use laid down herein does not extend to such information which is state of the art in the public domain and to which the Recipient has access without breach of law, and also not to such information to which the Recipient already had access without breach of law before the Information was disclosed to him by the Discloser, and finally not to such information which the Recipient was eligible to obtain from a third party. The Recipient bears the burden of proof. Nothing in this non-disclosure agreement will prevent the Recipient from making any disclosure of the Information required by law or by any competent authority. In such case the Recipient undertakes to inform the Discloser without delay of his obligation to disclose, will cooperate upon request of the Discloser and at own expenses on the defense against the obligation to disclose and will fulfil this obligation only to such extent as required by law.\n3. Upon request of the Discloser the Recipient will return all Information including all copies and records or delete electronically stored data \u2013 also in the framework of a back-up, provided this does not involve disproportionate expenditure, whereby the Discloser shall be provided proof of the deletion.\n4. There is mutual consent that this agreement cannot be interpreted in such a way that the Contract Partners grant each other a license for imparted know-how, inventions, and patents, or undertake to grant each other a license, grant other rights to intellectual property in connection with the Information. This agreement does not bind the Contract Partners in any service-, works-, broker-, joint venture- or company agreement.\n5. This Discloser shall not be liable for damage of any kind arising from the transfer or use of the Information; in particular, the Discloser is not responsible for the Information injuring the rights of third parties. The Discloser is not responsible for the completeness, correctness, or usability of the Information.\n6. An assignment of the rights arising from this agreement is not permitted. There is mutual agreement, however, that the rights granted in this agreement are due to the customer of the Discloser within the framework of an agreement in favor of a third party.\n7. This agreement is not a preliminary agreement and does not oblige either of the Contract Partners to enter into further contract negotiations or conclude a further-reaching contract. This agreement does not justify any further pre-contractual obligations.\n8. The Contract Partners agree that there is no adequate legal protection against any injury arising from this agreement due to the special nature of the Information to be kept secret. Any injury to the non-disclosure obligation would lead to irreparable damage to the Discloser. The Recipient therefore undertakes to inform the Discloser without delay as soon as has gained such knowledge himself of any unpermitted disclosure or unpermitted use as laid down in this agreement of any Information.\n9. This agreement comes into effect upon signing by both Contract Partners and applies to Information which has already been exchanged within the framework of the Purpose of Exchange. The agreement shall be valid for a fixed period of five years after the end of an individual Project or from the date of last disclosure. The non-disclosure obligation shall continue to apply upon termination of the agreement for the Information exchanged within the agreement.\n10. Each Contract Partner alone bears any costs arising in conjunction with this agreement and the Information.\n11. Amendments or modifications to this agreement require the written form. This also applies to an amendment or modification of this requirement of the written form.\n12. German law is applicable to this agreement. The court of jurisdiction for any disputes arising from or in the broadest sense in connection with this agreement as far as this is legally permissible. The Discloser has the right to take legal actions arising directly or indirectly out of this Non-discloser agreement against Contract Partner a court with jurisdiction at Discloser\u2019s discretion.\n13. Should any individual provisions of this agreement be or become invalid, this will not affect the remaining terms of this agreement. By means of (supplementary) interpretation the rules shall apply that correspond best to the economic purpose of the provision that has become invalid. If the interpretation is excluded for legal reasons, the Contract Partners undertake to make additional agreements. This also applies in the event of any gap arising and that must be filled upon implementation or interpretation of the agreement.\nSupplier:\nName of the Company:\nAddress:\nResponsible

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is made and entered into as of the ______ day of ___________________, 201___ (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between the University of Dayton, having a principal place of business at 300 College Park Drive, Dayton, OH 45469 (the \u201cUniversity\u201d), and ______________________________ (the \u201cVendor\u201d). For purposes of this Agreement, the University and Vendor are collectively referred to as \u201cparties,\u201d and each individually as a \u201cparty.\u201d\nWHEREAS, the University is exploring, with multiple service providers, the possibility of entering into a long-term collaborative relationship where the selected service provider would assume portions of the University\u2019s business services and/or functions of its Facilities Management organization (the \u201cProject\u201d);\nWHEREAS, Vendor desires that the University consider selecting it as a service provider for the Project;\nWHEREAS, the parties desire the ability to explore fully a potential relationship between them for the Project, but in so doing, both parties desire to keep confidential the details of their discussions as well as information they have shared and will share with each other in furtherance of assessing the Project;\nWHEREAS, the University desires that the mere fact of the Project\u2019s existence be kept strictly confidential unless and until the University decides to make that fact public (in which case such publicity shall be managed by the University); and\nWHEREAS, this Agreement sets forth the terms and restrictions that will apply to confidential and/or proprietary information exchanged by and between the parties.\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1.0 For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d can mean either the University or Vendor, and \u201cRecipient\u201d can mean either the University or Vendor.\n2.0 For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information of a confidential and/or proprietary nature first disclosed to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party in connection with discussions between the parties regarding the Project on, before or after the Effective Date, which information is either: (a) in documents or other tangible materials clearly marked CONFIDENTIAL or the like at the time of disclosure or otherwise communicated to be confidential; or (b) provided orally or in any other intangible form, if at the time of first disclosure the Disclosing Party tells the Recipient that the information is confidentially; or (c) although not marked \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d or verbally described to be confidential, Recipient reasonably should know the information is confidential and not generally known to the public. Confidential Information may be information and documents; in written or oral form; factual, interpretive or strategic; analyses, compilations, studies, records or data prepared by a party or a party\u2019s representatives; or information or documents that reflect or otherwise are generated from Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall also include the fact that the parties are considering the Project, until such date such fact is made public by the University.\n3.0 \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not mean or include, and the parties shall have no obligations with respect to, information which: (a) is already known to the Recipient at the time of its disclosure by the Disclosing Party, through no wrongful act of the Recipient; (b) is, or becomes, publicly known, through publication, inspection of a product or otherwise, and through no wrongful act of Recipient; (c) is or has been independently developed by or for the Recipient; (d) is received by the Recipient from a third party without similar restrictions as to non-disclosure and without breach of this Agreement; (e) is approved for release by written authorization of the Disclosing Party; or (f) is disclosed by the Recipient upon receipt of a legal opinion from counsel that such disclosure is required pursuant to the lawful requirement or request of a governmental agency or disclosure is otherwise required by operation of law (provided, however, that the Recipient shall notify and cooperate with Disclosing Party regarding such required disclosure as set forth in Section 6.0).\n4.0 The Recipient shall not disclose to any other person, firm or corporation, other than its employees, directors, agents, or representatives, including without limitation, attorneys, accountants, appraisers and financial advisors, who have a \u201cneed to know\u201d for purposes of completing any assessment of the Project (collectively, \u201crepresentatives\u201d) any of the Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party hereunder, by using the same degree of care to avoid disclosure of such Confidential Information as Recipient employs with respect to its own proprietary and confidential information of like kind. The Recipient further agrees to inform its representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and take reasonable steps to ensure its representatives will abide by the terms of this Agreement.\n5.0 The Confidential Information shall be and remain the property of the Disclosing Party and will be returned to the Disclosing Party immediately, upon written request, or destroyed, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s option. That portion of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information which consists of analyses, compilations, studies or other documents or records prepared by the Recipient, or its representatives, shall be held by the Recipient and kept confidential and subject to the terms of this Agreement, or shall be destroyed.\n6.0 In the event that the Recipient is requested to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information received hereunder, the Recipient agrees to immediately notify the Disclosing Party of the existence, terms, and circumstances surrounding such a request. If any court or regulatory order or other service of legal process or open records statute requires the Recipient to disclose information covered by its confidentiality obligation, then such party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of any such order or process so that the Disclosing Party may attempt to prevent such order of disclosure, and the parties shall also work together to ensure that any such required disclosure is carried out pursuant to a protective order (or other similar protection) to prevent further disclosure of the Confidential Information.\n7.0 Vendor shall not make use of this Agreement, or the University\u2019s name or that of any member of the University\u2019s staff, for publicity or advertising purposes without prior written approval of the University.\n8.0 The confidentiality requirements of this Agreement shall continue to apply even if Vendor is not selected by the University to perform the Project.\n9.0 The parties agree that irreparable harm may result if Vendor fails to abide by the confidentiality requirements set forth in the agreement. In the event of a breach by Vendor of the confidentiality requirements of this Agreement, the University shall have the right to seek injunctive and/or other preliminary or equitable relief, without having to prove actual damages or to post a bond. Such relief shall be in addition to any other remedies and damages available to the University.\n10.0 This Agreement and any performance hereunder shall be interpreted in accordance with and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.\n11.0 This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the confidential nature of materials exchanged as part of assessing, discussing or otherwise exploring the Project and supersedes all previous communications, both oral and written, representations and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. If any provisions of this Agreement are held to be invalid or unenforceable, they are to that extent to be deemed omitted and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n12.0 No amendment, modification, and/or discharge of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of each of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, and will become a binding agreement when one or more of the counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date first above written.\nUniversity of Dayton Vendor: _________________________________\n________________________________________________ _________________________________________________\nPrinted Name:

"      Non-Disclosure Agreement\nBetween\nEBZ <Company>\nBleicherstra\u00dfe 7\n88212 Ravensburg\n\u2013 herein referred to as PURCHASER \u2013\nand\n(company name and address)\n\u2013 herein referred to as CONTRACTOR \u2013\nI. The PURCHASER and the CONTRACTOR intend to cooperate.\nII. Within this cooperation, it is necessary that the PURCHASER makes available confidential documents, information, knowledge, samples and data to the CONTRACTOR.\nIII. For the reasons mentioned above, the CONTRACTOR is obliged to treat all documents, information, knowledge, samples and data made available to him by the PURCHASER, or made known to him at the PURCHASER, on the occasion of the cooperation strictly confidential and not to make these available to third parties in a direct or indirect way, neither entirely nor partly. In addition, the granted prices and conditions to the PURCHASER are secrecy and may not be disclosed to third parties without the express written consent of the PURCHASER.\nIV. The CONTRACTOR must neither assert copyrights or other rights on documents, information, knowledge and data based on documents, information, knowledge and data which is put down to the PURCHASER, nor make or have made objects for himself or third parties, in which or upon the manufacture of which documents, information, knowledge, samples and data by the PURCHASER directly or indirectly are used, unless the PURCHASER has given written approval explicitly beforehand.\nV. The CONTRACTOR must make all adequate arrangements in his premises, where he carries out work for the PURCHASER, in order to adhere to the non-disclosure agreement according to this agreement; he will especially ensure that third parties will not gain access to the locations where the PURCHASER orders are handled.\nVI. The CONTRACTOR is obliged to commit his employees to the appropriate secrecy in written form as far as confidential documents, information, knowledge, samples and data are made available to these in the course of the cooperation or they can gain access to documents, information, knowledge, samples and data by the PURCHASER. On request, the CONTRACTOR will present the non-disclosure agreement to the PURCHASER according to clause 1.\nVII. Beyond the scope mentioned above, the CONTRACTOR is obliged not to use any of the documents, information, knowledge, samples and data, which have been made available or which have become known to him directly or indirectly at the PURCHASER for gaining copyrights or other rights.\nVIII. The obligation to maintain secrecy as mentioned before is not valid for such documents, information, knowledge, samples and data, which have already been public at the moment of their forwarding, which have become public after their forwarding without the CONTRACTOR being responsible for this, which have been made available to the other CONTRACTOR by a third party after their forwarding in a legally allowable way and without any limitation regarding secrecy or use, which have provably been in the possession of the other CONTRACTOR already at the moment of their forwarding.\nIX. The CONTRACTOR will return all documents, information, knowledge, samples and data provided in the course of the cooperation including all copies thereof to the PURCHASER. In the case of retention of documents, information, knowledge, samples and data or copies by the CONTRACTOR or his assistants or agents, the PURCHASER may assert claim for damages.\nX. The CONTRACTOR will observe the BDSG (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz = German Data Protection Act), regulations and other regulations for the data protection. In the case that the CONTRACTOR is granted access no matter of which kind by the PURCHASER to data for performance of the contractual works in terms of the BDSG or made known such data by the PURCHASER, the CONTRACTOR will only consign Employees, Assistants or Agents with the performance of the contractual work, who are obliged to data secrecy in terms of \u00a7 5 BDSG. On request of the PURCHASER, the CONTRACTOR will present the agreement made with the Employees, Assistants or Agents.\nThe CONTRACTOR will not make available or known the data forwarded or made known by the PURCHASER in terms of the BDSG to third parties, neither directly nor indirectly, and only use it to perform the work.\nAfter completion of the work, the CONTRACTOR will return all data forwarded by the PURCHASER including the copies thereof to the PURCHASER or completely delete the data including the copies thereof.\nXI. In the case of violating the obligations mentioned above, the CONTRACTOR will pay a contract penalty for every case of violation against one of the obligations taken over in the amount of\nEuro xxx.xxx (in words: EUR xxx thousand).\nThe assertion of the actually occurred damage remains untouched, while the forfeited contract penalty is deducted.\nXII. This non-disclosure agreement as described before ends soonest after expiration of a term of five (5) years after termination of the cooperation. Should information, knowledge, documents, samples and data require secrecy without alteration at the moment of the termination of the cooperation, the agreement partners coincide that the CONTRACTOR agrees to an extension of the term, if requested by the PURCHASER.\nXIII. Should present or future provisions of this agreement partly or entirely not be legally effective or not feasible, or later lose their legal effectiveness or feasibility, the validity of the other provisions of this agreement remain untouched. In this case, every partner to the agreement can demand the agreement of a valid provision which reaches the purpose of the ineffective provision the closest.\nXIV. The exclusive court of jurisdiction for all quarrels occurring from or in connection with this agreement including the question of achieving this agreement, its termination and its continuation after termination is the Purchaser\u2019s general court of jurisdiction.\nRavensburg,\n(place and date) (place and date)\n(Firm Stamp, Signature (Firm Stamp, Signature\nPURCHASER)

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT is made on 06/18/18- 06/22/18\nBETWEEN\n1. SDSS-IV LOC (the \""Disclosing Party\""); and\n2. Non-members, Name: (the \""Receiving Party\""),\ncollectively referred to as the \""Parties\"".\nRECITALS\nA. The Receiving Party understands that the Disclosing Party has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the meeting of the SDSS-III collaboration. Proprietary data and papers in preparation based on those data will be discussed. Comments and participation in discussions during this meeting do not imply any expectation or reciprocation of co-authorship on published works. To the extent previously, presently, or subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party is hereinafter referred to as \""Proprietary Information\"" of the Disclosing Party.\nOPERATIVE PROVISIONS\n1. In consideration of the disclosure of Proprietary Information by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party hereby agrees: (i) to hold the Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its own confidential materials), (ii) not to disclose any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person, (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally its relationship with the Disclosing Party, and (iv) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. The Receiving Party shall procure that its employees, agents and sub-contractors to whom Proprietary Information is disclosed or who have access to Proprietary Information sign a nondisclosure or similar agreement in content substantially similar to this Agreement\n2. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information after five years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (i) is or becomes (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any affiliate, agent, consultant or employee) generally available to the public, or (ii) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party as evidenced in writing, except to the extent that such information was unlawfully appropriated, or (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by law or court order provided the Receiving Party uses diligent reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and has allowed the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order.\n3. Immediately upon the written request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will return to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof, save that where such Proprietary Information is a form incapable of return or has been copied or transcribed into another document, it shall be destroyed or erased, as appropriate.\n4. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any transaction or relationship.\n5. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or unenforceable neither the validity, nor enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall be affected. Neither Party shall assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement without the consent of the other Party. This Agreement may not be amended for any other reason without the prior written agreement of both Parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof unless any representation or warranty made about this Agreement was made fraudulently and, save as may be expressly referred to or referenced herein, supersedes all prior representations, writings, negotiations or understandings with respect hereto.\n6. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Disclosing Party is located (or if the Disclosing Party is based in more than one country, the country in which its headquarters are located) (the \""Territory\"") and the parties agree to submit disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement to the non-exclusive of the courts in the Territory.\n[SDSS- IV LOC] [Non-member]\nBy: _________________________________ By: _________________________________\nSDSS-IV Practices Regarding Attendance of Non-members at SDSS-IV Meetings\nWe occasionally invite non-members of the SDSS-IV collaboration to full collaboration or team meetings. Our default attitude towards this attendance is that it promotes the free exchange of ideas and is consistent with our core mission as a project. However, we also want to be careful that the conditions of this attendance are understood on both sides, particularly since authorship on SDSS-IV papers is restricted by the Publication Policy.\nAgreement of Non-disclosure of SDSS-III Data and Results I acknowledge that I have been invited to a private meeting of the SDSS-III collaboration in which proprietary data and papers in preparation based on those data will be discussed. I agree not to make use of information gained at the meeting in ways that would harm the interests of the collaboration. In addition, my comments and participation in discussions during this meeting do not imply any expectation or reciprocation of co-authorship on published works.\n"",","nondisclosure, agreementnthis, agreement, made, 061818, 062218nbetweenn1, sdssiv, loc, disclosing, party, andn2, nonmember, name, receiving, partyncollectively, referred, partiesnrecitalsna, receiving, party, understands, disclosing, party, disclosed, may, disclose, information, relating, meeting, sdssiii, collaboration, proprietary, data, paper, preparation, based, data, discussed, comment, participation, discussion, meeting, imply, expectation, reciprocation, coauthorship, published, work, extent, previously, presently, subsequently, disclosed, receiving, party, hereinafter, referred, proprietary, information, disclosing, partynoperative, provisionsn1, consideration, disclosure, proprietary, information, disclosing, party, receiving, party, hereby, agrees, hold, proprietary, information, strict, confidence, take, reasonable, precaution, protect, proprietary, information, including, without, limitation, precaution, receiving, party, employ, respect, confidential, material, ii, disclose, proprietary, information, information, derived, therefrom, third, person, iii, make, use, whatsoever, time, proprietary, information, except, evaluate, internally, relationship, disclosing, party, iv, copy, reverse, engineer, proprietary, information, receiving, party, shall, procure, employee, agent, subcontractor, proprietary, information, disclosed, access, proprietary, information, sign, nondisclosure, similar, agreement, content, substantially, similar, agreementn2, without, granting, right, license, disclosing, party, agrees, foregoing, shall, apply, respect, information, five, year, following, disclosure, thereof, information, receiving, party, document, becomes, improper, action, inaction, receiving, party, affiliate, agent, consultant, employee, generally, available, public, ii, possession, known, prior, receipt, disclosing, party, evidenced, writing, except, extent, information, unlawfully, appropriated, iii, rightfully, disclosed, third, party, iv, independently, developed, without, use, proprietary, information, disclosing, party, receiving, party, may, make, disclosure, required, law, court, order, provided, receiving, party, us, diligent, reasonable, effort, limit, disclosure, allowed, disclosing, party, seek, protective, ordern3, immediately, upon, written, request, disclosing, party, time, receiving, party, return, disclosing, party, proprietary, information, document, medium, containing, proprietary, information, copy, extract, thereof, save, proprietary, information, form, incapable, return, copied, transcribed, another, document, shall, destroyed, erased, appropriaten4, receiving, party, understands, nothing, herein, requires, disclosure, proprietary, information, ii, requires, disclosing, party, proceed, transaction, relationshipn5, failure, either, party, enforce, right, agreement, time, period, shall, construed, waiver, right, part, term, provision, agreement, held, illegal, unenforceable, neither, validity, enforceability, remainder, agreement, shall, affected, neither, party, shall, assign, transfer, part, right, agreement, without, consent, party, agreement, may, amended, reason, without, prior, written, agreement, party, agreement, constitutes, entire, understanding, party, relating, subject, matter, hereof, unless, representation, warranty, made, agreement, made, fraudulently, save, may, expressly, referred, referenced, herein, supersedes, prior, representation, writing, negotiation, understanding, respect, hereton6, agreement, shall, governed, law, jurisdiction, disclosing, party, located, disclosing, party, based, one, country, country, headquarters, located, territory, party, agree, submit, dispute, arising, connection, agreement, nonexclusive, court, territorynsdss, iv, loc, nonmembernby, nsdssiv, practice, regarding, attendance, nonmember, sdssiv, meetingsnwe, occasionally, invite, nonmember, sdssiv, collaboration, full, collaboration, team, meeting, default, attitude, towards, attendance, promotes, free, exchange, idea, consistent, core, mission, project, however, also, want, careful, condition, attendance, understood, side, particularly, since, authorship, sdssiv, paper, restricted, publication, policynagreement, nondisclosure, sdssiii, data, result, acknowledge, invited, private, meeting, sdssiii, collaboration, proprietary, data, paper, preparation, based, data, discussed, agree, make, use, information, gained, meeting, way, would, harm, interest, collaboration, addition, comment, participation, discussion, meeting, imply, expectation, reciprocation, coauthorship, published, worksn"

The PARTY served with such demand, order or process shall resist disclosure on grounds of this AGREEMENT, and shall take all reasonable steps to provide the DISCLOSING PARTY a full and fair opportunity, prior to disclosure, to resist, oppose or otherwise limit any disclosure of such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The PARTY will disclose only such information as is legally required and will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION that is so disclosed.\n(g) Upon the written request of a DISCLOSING PARTY, a PARTY shall return, or destroy, at DISCLOSING PARTY\u2019s option, within seven (7) business days, any and all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION disclosed or provided to that PARTY by the DISCLOSING PARTY.\n(h) It is expressly understood and agreed by the PARTIES that no right, title, interest, license, or ownership or other right in any copyright, patent, trademark or other intellectual property or proprietary right of any DISCLOSING PARTY or any third party shall be granted or transferred to any RECEIVING PARTY or any ENTITY or other third party pursuant to, or as a result of, this AGREEMENT.\n(i) It is further expressly understood and agreed by the PARTIES that nothing contained in this AGREEMENT, and nothing contained in any information disclosed pursuant to this AGREEMENT, shall constitute any representation or warranty by the DISCLOSING PARTY with respect to the non-infringing ownership of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION or the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n(j) It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION disclosed to any governmental ENTITY, officer or employee pursuant to this AGREEMENT (i) will not become an \u201cagency record\u201d by virtue of such disclosure; (ii) is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4) (\u201cExemption 4\u201d); (iii) shall not be disclosed pursuant to any other governmental authority; and (iv), is protected from disclosure under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905, and thus may not be published, divulged, disclosed or otherwise made known in any manner. The PARTIES to this AGREEMENT that are governmental ENTITIES further agree that neither they nor their officers or employees will take custody or control of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION disclosed pursuant to this AGREEMENT. To that end, among other things, such governmental ENTITIES and their officers and employees agree immediately to return all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to the DISCLOSING PARTY at the conclusion of any meeting at which such information is disclosed or, if such information is disclosed at any other time, to return such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION immediately after reviewing it. In addition, any PARTY to this AGREEMENT that is a governmental ENTITY agrees to refrain from making copies of, taking notes or sending e-mail regarding, or otherwise creating or retaining any written or electronic material containing such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n4. Remedies: Damages, Injunctions and Specific Performance. The PARTIES expressly understand and agree that the covenants and agreements to be rendered and performed by the PARTIES pursuant to this AGREMEENT are special, unique, and of an extraordinary character, and in the event of any default, or breach by any PARTY of this AGREEMENT, the affected PARTY shall have no adequate remedy at law and shall be entitled to seek such relief as may be available to it pursuant hereto, at law or in equity, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any proceedings to: (i) obtain direct damages for any breach of this AGREEMENT; (ii) order the specific performance thereof; or (iii) enjoin the breach of such provisions.

"      CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE AND COMPUTER ACCESS (SECURITY) AGREEMENT\n\u201cResponsibilities\u201d\nA. Every person who has been given access to a University of Nebraska information system or who has access to or knowledge of confidential or sensitive information or data, is obligated to keep such data confidential. Accordingly, every University of Nebraska employee, student, volunteer, contractor, business associate, or guest who either has or will be given access to printed or online confidential data is required to read and acknowledge his or her understanding of this agreement before being granted access.\n1. I will only access confidential or sensitive data for legitimate business purposes as permitted by the University and will not use confidential or sensitive data for personal use. I understand that confidential or sensitive data includes but is not limited to databases and records containing Social Security numbers, checking and savings account numbers, non-published telephone numbers, personnel appraisals, educational records, medical history, and insurance coverage information.\n2. I will not leave confidential or sensitive data in view of others who do not have a legitimate business reason to view the data and I will only share confidential data with persons having authorized access.\n3. I will not discuss confidential or sensitive information or data in public places and will not remove confidential or sensitive data from my work site without University authorization.\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nB. As an employee, contractor or consultant of the University of Nebraska, and related to my job responsibilities or assigned tasks, I may have access to, come in contact with, or reference confidential or sensitive information or data. Examples of this information and data include, but are not limited to: passwords, student disciplinary and academic records, personal health information, medical and research data, Social Security numbers, legally protected information, financial reports, security parameters and configurations, payroll information and personnel records, system logs and network traffic data, etc. This information or data is subject to University policies as well as regulatory and special handling requirements.\n1. I accept responsibility for appropriate handling and management of information and data whether I come into contact with such information through my authorized access or in error.\n2. I will maintain the con\ufb01dentiality of this information and if uncertain about the appropriateness of who this information may be shared with in the course of my authorized access, I will discuss any questions I have with my supervisor or the Central Administration security o\ufb03ce. I understand that even the most innocuous \ufb01le can contain con\ufb01dential information.\n3. In all instances as described above, I acknowledge my personal obligation to protect, through execution of reasonable steps, the confidentiality, integrity and privacy of this data in accordance with University policies, regulatory requirements or other special handling requirements, and prevent unauthorized access, modification, destruction or disclosure of sensitive or confidential data. In the absence of stated guidance or without a clear indication of sensitivity, I will treat and handle all data as if it were sensitive.\nC. Acknowledgement\n1. I have read and understand the statements presented in the above \u201cResponsibilities\u201d section regarding my permitted and potential/inadvertent access to confidential or sensitive information or data.\n2. I agree with these stated responsibilities.\n3. I understand that misuse of confidential or sensitive information or data, whether intentional or due to neglect on my part, is a breach of policy and grounds for corrective action which may include my dismissal, the termination of access to University resources, or the termination of a contractual agreement and may subject me to possible civil and/or criminal legal action.\nD. During the course of my work or activities at the University of Nebraska, I may be assigned a computer user login ID and instructed to develop personal passwords. In order to maintain the confidentiality of non-public data, I agree to the following:\n1. I will adhere to the University of Nebraska\u2019s Executive Memorandum No. 16, Policy for Responsible Use of University Computers and Information Systems, University of Nebraska\u2019s Executive Memorandum No. 26, Information Security Plan, and to any additional specific policies that I may be asked to follow.\n2. I will obtain authorization from the University prior to gaining access to those specific computer functions necessary to perform my responsibilities.\n3. I will not share my computer user login IDs and passwords with anyone, at any time, for any reason, except in cases necessary to facilitate computer maintenance and repairs.\n4. I will not leave a terminal, personal computer or computer workstation without locking or ending any application that either contains or can be used to access confidential or sensitive information or data.\n5. I will not disclose any budget, financial, personnel, payroll or procurement information except to the extent necessary to carry out the responsibilities of my employment or as otherwise required by the law.\n6. I will contact the University immediately if I discover that my computer user login ID or password has been compromised, if I suspect that University digital asset has been misused, or if I suspect that someone has obtained unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive information or data on the University of Nebraska information system.\n 7. I also understand that improper use of my computer user login ID or password is a breach of policy and grounds for corrective action which may include dismissal, the termination of access to University resources, or the termination of a contractual agreement and may subject me to possible civil and/or criminal legal action.\nSignature: ____________________________________

Security Service Providers\u2019 Association (the \u201cICoCA\u201d or the \u201cAssociation\u201d)(together the Parties).\nPrimary Purpose\nThe Primary Purpose of the Agreement is to enable the sharing of information between the Association and the Recipient in a manner that enables the proper functioning of the Association and the full participation of members while also providing access to Confidential Information (as defined in this Agreement) and the responsibilities to ensure that such information is not disseminated or used inappropriately.\nThe Parties agree that the disclosure of information designated as Confidential Information under this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement shall not breach the Agreement in the following circumstances:\n(a) Where the Confidential Information is in the public domain for reasons other than any act or omission of the Association or the Recipient; and/or\n(b) Where the Parties have a mandatory, legally binding obligation which requires disclosure of Confidential Information.\nThe Recipient hereby agrees and affirms his/her understanding of the following:\n(1) that in the normal course of business of the Association, there may be times when Recipient, as a Director, Officer, or Staff Member of the Association, receives information that is confidential, sensitive, and/or not in the public domain and that, if disclosed to persons other than those for whom the information as intended, has the potential to harm the Association, its individual members, other participants, or any of their business partners or related entities or persons (such information hereafter referred to as \u201cConfidential Information\u201d);\n(2) that the disclosure of Confidential Information to persons other than those to whom the information was intended, and for purposes other than the normal business operations of the Association, is not only damaging to the fundamental relationship of trust that exists between and among the Association and its members but may jeopardize the Association\u2019s ability to function effectively and subject it to potential legal liability and other consequences;\n(3) that the Recipient has been or will be provided with access to certain Confidential Information solely for the purpose of carrying out his/her responsibilities as a Director, Officer, or Staff Member of the Association;\n(4) that the Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than the Directors, Officers, or Staff Members of the Association, unless he/she has clear instruction from the Executive Director or Board Chairperson to do so, and then shall disclose such information only for the limited purpose for which such instruction is given and no other purpose;\n(5) that the Recipient is aware of and has reviewed the ICoCA\u2019s Conflict of Interest and Information Security policies and that Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information to any person within the Association (i.e., the Directors, Officers, or Staff Members) if the disclosure of such information would violate the Association\u2019s Conflict of Interest or Information Security policies;\n(6) that in the event Recipient violates any part of this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Association may pursue legal and/or equitable remedies from Recipient;\n(7) that in the event any proceeding to enforce this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement or decide any matter relating to it Recipient becomes necessary, the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Switzerland pertaining thereto and the Recipient agrees to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland; and\n(8) that continued adherence to this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement is an essential term of employment as a Staff Member of the Association and/or an essential part of the Recipient\u2019s roles and responsibilities as a Director or Officer, the violation of which will permit the Association to terminate such employment or terminate such person from his7her position in addition to seeking any other legal or equitable remedies.\nDefinition of Confidential Information\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, financial or other competitive business information that may be collected by the Association regarding industry members (and non-members) of the Association, information of a personal nature regarding any of the officers, staff, or employees of the Association or its members, information shared in the course of Board or other Association meetings or discussions (unless such information has been specifically cleared for public release), and any other information which might be reasonably foreseen to be harmful if disclosed outside of the Association and/or for reasons other than in accordance with a Director\u2019s, Officer\u2019s, or Staff Member\u2019s duties to the Association.\nIn the case that the Recipient is unclear or has any question regarding whether or not a particular piece of information falls within Confidential Information, the Recipient will consult with the Executive Director or Office Manager prior to disclosing such information.\nSigned and agreed to this ___ day of ______________,

All information disclosed by or on behalf of a party (\u201cDiscloser\u201d) and/or its Affiliates during the term of this Agreement which is received, learned, or observed by the other party (\u201cRecipient\u201d) and/or its Affiliates is \u201cConfidential Information,\u201d including, but not limited to, business and financial information, marketing and strategic plans, customer lists, employee lists, reports, technologies, processes and operations, compilations, analyses, forecasts, studies, summaries, notes, data, product designs, drawings, prints, specifications, production schedules, test data, operations, inventions, know-how, component and part designs, schematics, formulations, samples, passwords, machines, network IDs, prototypes, mock-ups, templates, processing and control information, product performance data, manuals, purchase and sales records, warranty and repair records, marketing information, quotes and pricing information, computer programs, or the like, including e-mail and electronic communication discussing any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information that is:\n(a) already lawfully in the possession of or known to Recipient as of the Effective Date without any obligation of confidentiality;\n(b) already in the public domain at the time of disclosure to Recipient or which, after such disclosure, enters into the public domain through no fault of Recipient;\n(c) lawfully furnished or disclosed to Recipient by a non-party to this Agreement without any obligation of confidentiality and through no wrongful act of Recipient;\n(d) independently developed by Recipient without the use of any Confidential Information; or\n(e) explicitly approved for public release by Discloser.\nThe foregoing list of exceptions is exhaustive and shall be strictly construed. In cases of doubt as to the use of Confidential Information, Recipient shall request that Discloser provide prior express written authorization of such use.\n3. NON-DISCLOSURE.

CONFIDENTIALITY. Recipient shall take reasonable measures to protect Confidential Information from misuse and unauthorized disclosure, but in no event less than the measures it takes to protect its own confidential information. Prior to disclosure of Confidential Information to Recipient\u2019s contractor, agent, supplier or advisor, Recipient shall ensure that such contractor, agent, supplier or advisor has executed a non-disclosure agreement for the benefit of Green Industrial Supply, Inc. in form and substance equivalent to this Agreement. Recipient shall be responsible for any misuse or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by its Representatives or Representatives of its Affiliates. A disclosure of Confidential Information required under legal process shall not be considered to be a breach of confidentiality by Recipient or a waiver of such obligation by Discloser. Before any such disclosure, however, Recipient shall provide prompt written notice to Discloser to enable it to seek a protective order or prevent disclosure.\n6. RETURN OF MATERIALS. All forms of Confidential Information, tangible and electronic, and all copies thereof, shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of Discloser, and shall be promptly returned or destroyed by Recipient upon the earlier of the written request of Discloser or the termination of this Agreement.

NO ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS. This Agreement shall not be interpreted to obligate any party to provide or accept any Confidential Information to or from any other party, or to enter into any further contract or arrangement with any other party, or to purchase or sell any products or services from or to any other party, or to create any joint-venture or partnership.\n10. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The parties agree not to assign any rights or delegate any duties under this Agreement without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempt to do so is void and has no effect.\n11. LAW AND VENUE. The laws of the State of Iowa, without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles, govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and forum and/or venue in, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in Iowa for the purposes of adjudicating any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect, so long as the essential terms and conditions of this Agreement reflect the original intent of the parties and remain valid, legal, and enforceable. The failure of a party to enforce a provision, exercise a right or pursue a default of this Agreement shall not be considered a waiver. The express waiver of a provision is to be effective only in the specific instance, and as to the specific purpose, for which it was given.\n13. REMEDIES. It is agreed that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for breach of this Agreement. Discloser is entitled to seek injunctive relief without proof of actual damages. In addition, Discloser may seek other appropriate relief, including monetary damages. Unless stated otherwise, all remedies provided for in this Agreement are to be cumulative and in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity or otherwise.\n14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties and supersedes any and all prior oral agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to the Purpose provided for herein. This Agreement is to be construed without regard to the party or parties responsible for its drafting or preparation. The section headings and captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and do not affect the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

Definition of Confidential Information and Exclusions.\n(a) \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means nonpublic information that a party to this Agreement (\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) designates as being confidential to the party that receives such information (\u201cReceiving Party\u201d) or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential by the Receiving Party.\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes, without limitation, information in tangible or intangible form relating to and/or including released or unreleased Disclosing Party software or hardware products, the marketing or promotion of any Disclosing Party product, Disclosing Party\u2019s business policies or practices, Disclosing Party\u2019s product pricing information, the terms and conditions of any proposed (or actual) license agreement or other agreement concerning Disclosing Party\u2019s products, license negotiations, and information received from others that Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential.\nIn particular, the source code and libraries developed and/or maintained by \u201cBlack and White Inc\u201d should be regarded as strictly confidential, even if it is further modified or improved by the Receiving Party.\nExcept as otherwise indicated in this Agreement, the term \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d also includes all Affiliates of the Disclosing Party and, except as otherwise indicated, the term \u201cReceiving Party\u201d also includes all Affiliates of the Receiving Party. An \u201cAffiliate\u201d means any person, partnership, joint venture, corporation or other form of enterprise, domestic or foreign, including but not limited to subsidiaries, that directly or indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with a party.\nWhere the Receiving Party uses Confidential Information to maintain or develop software for any person, partnership, joint venture, corporation or other form of enterprise or customer, it shall take all necessary precautions to ensure that such Confidential Information, particularly source code, is not disclosed to these parties, unless specific written permission is obtained from \u201cBlack and White Inc\u201d in advance.\n(b) Confidential Information shall not include any information, however designated, that:\n(i) is or subsequently becomes publicly available without Receiving Party\u2019s breach of any obligation owed Disclosing Party;\n(ii) became known to Receiving Party prior to Disclosing Party\u2019s disclosure of such information to Receiving Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;\n(iii) became known to Receiving Party from a source other than Disclosing Party other than by the breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Disclosing Party;\n(iv) is independently developed by Receiving Party; or\n(v) constitutes Feedback (as defined in Section 5 of this Agreement).\n2. Obligations Regarding Confidential Information\n(a) Receiving Party shall:\n(i) Refrain from disclosing any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to third parties for ten (10) years following the date that Disclosing Party first discloses such Confidential Information to Receiving Party, for any reason whatsoever, except as expressly provided in Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of this Agreement;\n(ii) Take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own Confidential Information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party;\n(iii) Refrain from disclosing, reproducing, summarizing and/or distributing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except in pursuance of Receiving Party\u2019s business relationship with Disclosing Party, and only as otherwise provided hereunder; and\n(iv) Refrain from reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling any software code and/or pre-release hardware devices disclosed by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party under the terms of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted by applicable law.\n(b) Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order, provided that Receiving Party either\n(i) gives the undersigned Disclosing Party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure to allow Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order or equivalent, or\n(ii) obtains written assurance from the applicable judicial or governmental entity that it will afford the Confidential Information the highest level of protection afforded under applicable law or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not disclose any computer source code that contains Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order unless it complies with the requirement set forth in sub-section (i) of this Section 2(b).\n(c) The undersigned Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to Receiving Party\u2019s employees and consultants on a need-to-know basis. The undersigned Receiving Party will have executed or shall execute appropriate written agreements with its employees and consultants sufficient to enable it to comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.\n(d) Receiving Party shall notify the undersigned Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party and its employees and consultants, and will cooperate with Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.\n(e) Receiving Party shall, at Disclosing Party\u2019s request, return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information and all other tangible materials and devices provided to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information, or at Disclosing Party\u2019s option, certify destruction of the same.\n3. Rights and Remedies\n(a) Receiving Party shall notify the undersigned Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party and its employees and consultants, and will cooperate with Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.\n(b) Receiving Party shall, at Disclosing Party\u2019s request, return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information and all other tangible materials and devices provided to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information, or at Disclosing Party\u2019s option, certify destruction of the same.\n(c) The parties acknowledge that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the property of Disclosing Party. By disclosing Confidential Information to Receiving Party, Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right to Receiving Party to or under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information except as otherwise provided herein. Disclosing Party reserves without prejudice the ability to protect its rights under any such patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets except as otherwise provided herein.\n(b) In the event that the Disclosing Party provides any computer software and/or hardware to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement, such computer software and/or hardware may only be used by the Receiving Party for evaluation and providing Feedback (as defined in Section 5 of this Agreement) to the Disclosing Party. Unless otherwise agreed by the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, all such computer software and/or hardware is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d without warranty of any kind, and Receiving Party agrees that neither Disclosing Party nor its suppliers shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising from or relating to Receiving Party\u2019s use or inability to use such software and/or hardware.\n(c) The parties agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to\n(i) any Confidential Information, or\n(ii) any product (or any part thereof), process or service that is the direct product of the Confidential Information, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by South African and other governments.\n(d) The terms of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party\u2019s right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information. Further, the Receiving Party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or work with the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, provided that the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Confidential Information except as expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The term \u201cresiduals\u201d means information in intangible form, which is retained in memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. The Receiving Party shall not have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. However, this sub-paragraph shall not be deemed to grant to the Receiving Party a license under the Disclosing Party\u2019s copyrights or patents.\n(e) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.\n(f) If either the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\n(g) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party\u2019s respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that neither party may assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of the other party.\n(h) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n(i) If any Confidential Information is disclosed to any other party, both the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party shall be deemed to be equally responsible for the consequences of such disclosure, including, but not restricted to, liability for patent or copyright infringement of any other party\u2019s code thus disclosed, and/or failure to obtain the necessary permission to use the code or proprietary information contained therein.\n(j) Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination.\n5. Suggestions and Feedback\nThe Receiving Party may from time to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback (\u201cFeedback\u201d) to the Disclosing Party with respect to Confidential Information provided originally by the Disclosing Party. Both parties agree that all Feedback is and shall be given entirely voluntarily. Feedback, even if designated as confidential by the Disclosing Party, shall not, absent a separate written agreement, create any confidentiality obligation for the Receiving Party. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided herein or in a separate subsequent written agreement between the parties, the Receiving Party shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF,

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n[NTD: Insert date]\n[NTD: Insert name and contact information of Potential Bidder]\nAttention: [NTD: Insert name]\nDear Sirs & Mesdames:\nPursuant to a Receivership Order granted on October 12, 2017 by the Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (the \u201cCourt\u201d), FTI Consulting Canada Inc. (the \u201cReceiver\u201d) was appointed as receiver over a portion of the business and operations (the \u201cBusiness\u201d), and certain assets, undertakings, and properties (the \u201cProperty\u201d) of, Blaze Energy Ltd. and Wild Rose Energy Ltd. (together, with the Receiver, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, or \u201cwe\u201d).\nOn November 17, 2017 the Court approved a Sale and Investment Solicitation Process (the \u201cSISP\u201d) respecting the Business and Property. The purpose of the SISP is to seek proposals to purchase some or all of the Business and Property. Capitalized terms used in this non-disclosure agreement (\u201cNDA\u201d) and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the SISP.\nThe SISP describes the following: (a) the manner in which prospective bidders may participate in the SISP and have access to due diligence materials and Confidential Information (as defined below) concerning the Company, the Business, and the Property; (b) the manner in which bidders may become Qualified Bidders and submit Qualified Bids; (c) the process for the evaluation of the bids received; (d) the process for the ultimate selection of a Successful Bidder; and (e) the process for obtaining such approvals (including the approval of the Court) as may be necessary or appropriate in respect of a Successful Bid.\nIn executing this NDA, you (the \u201cPotential Bidder\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d) acknowledge receipt of a copy of the SISP, attached as Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto, and hereby agree to accept and be bound by the provisions contained therein as the same may be amended, from time to time, with the approval of the Court.\nYou confirm your interest in participating in the SISP initially as a Potential Bidder and with a view to becoming a Qualified Phase I Bidder, a Qualified Phase II Bidder, and a Successful Bidder in order to close a transaction contemplated by such Successful Bid (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). In that regard, you have requested that Confidential Information (as defined herein) be furnished to you. As a condition to us furnishing Confidential Information to you, and in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, you agree on behalf of yourself, your affiliates, and Representatives (as defined herein and to the extent such affiliates and Representatives are in receipt of all or any part of the Confidential Information) as follows:\n1. Confidential Information \u2013 The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means: (a) any and all information of whatever nature (including information in the form not only of written information but also information which may be transmitted orally, visually, graphically, electronically, or by any other means) relating to the Company, the Business, the Property, or the Transaction including, without limitation, information concerning any past, present, or future customers, suppliers or our technology, and any correspondence, internal business discussions, strategic plans, budgets, financial statements, records, reports, evaluations, notes, analyses, documents, engineering, trade secrets, know-how, data, patents, copyrights, processes, business rules, tools, business processes, techniques, programs, designs, formulae, marketing, advertising, financial, commercial, sales or programming materials, equipment configurations, system access codes and passwords, written materials, compositions, drawings, diagrams, computer programs, studies, works in progress, visual demonstrations, ideas, concepts, or any other documents or information pertaining in any way whatsoever to the Company; (b) all information about an identifiable individual or other information that is subject to any federal, provincial, or other applicable statute, law, or regulation of any governmental or regulatory authority in Canada relating to the collection, use, storage, and/or disclosure of information about an identifiable individual, including the Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act (Canada) and equivalent provincial legislation, whether or not any such information is confidential (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d); and (c) all summaries, notes, analyses, compilations, data, studies, or other documents or records prepared by the Potential Bidder or its Representatives that contain or otherwise reflect or have been generated, wholly or partly, or derived from, any such information (\u201cDerivative Information\u201d). The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include such portions of the Confidential Information which: (i) are, or prior to the time of disclosure or utilization become, generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your Representatives; (ii) are received by you from an independent third party who had obtained the Confidential Information lawfully and was under no obligation of secrecy or confidentiality; (iii) you can demonstrate were in your lawful possession before you received such Confidential Information from us; or (iv) you can demonstrate were independently developed by you or on your behalf by personnel having no access to the Confidential Information at the time of its independent development. In addition, you agree that the Company may, in its sole discretion, withhold or provide information requested by you.\n2. Non-Disclosure and Restricted Use \u2013 The Confidential Information will be kept confidential by the Potential Bidder and will not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as permitted by this NDA, be disclosed by the Potential Bidder or any of its Representatives in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and will not be used by the Potential Bidder or any of its Representatives, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than evaluating, negotiating, and consummating a Transaction (the \u201cPermitted Purpose\u201d). You will not use the Confidential Information so as to obtain any commercial advantage over us or in any way which is, directly or indirectly, detrimental to us. Neither you nor any of your affiliates will alter, decompose, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise modify any Confidential Information received hereunder that relates to the research and development, intellectual property, processes, new product developments, product designs, formulae, technical information, patent information, know-how, or trade secrets of the Company. The Potential Bidder agrees to comply with any applicable privacy laws in respect of Confidential Information relating to individuals. The Potential Bidder recognizes and acknowledges the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that could result to the Company if any information contained therein is disclosed to any person.\n3. Storage and Records \u2013 You shall store the Confidential Information properly and securely and ensure that appropriate physical, technological, and organisational measures are in place to protect the Confidential Information against unauthorised or unintended access, use, or disclosure. You will only reproduce or take such copies of any of the Confidential Information as is reasonably necessary for the Permitted Purpose. You shall keep a record of the Confidential Information furnished to you, in any medium other than oral, and of the location of such Confidential Information.\n4. Access Limited to Representatives \u2013 The Potential Bidder may reveal or permit access to the Confidential Information only to its agents, representatives (including lawyers, accountants, and financial advisors), directors, officers, and employees (each a \u201cRepresentative\u201d) who require access to the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, who are informed by the Potential Bidder of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, who are directed by the Potential Bidder to hold the Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and who agree to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this NDA. The Potential Bidder will take all necessary precautions or measures as may be reasonable in the circumstances to prevent improper access to the Confidential Information or use or disclosure of the Confidential Information by the Potential Bidder\u2019s Representatives and will be responsible and liable for any breach of this NDA by any of the Potential Bidder\u2019s Representatives. You will, in the event of a breach of this NDA or any disclosure of Confidential Information by you or any of your Representatives, other than as permitted by this NDA through accident, inadvertence, or otherwise, notify us of the nature of the breach promptly upon your discovery of the breach or disclosure.\nYou acknowledge that certain of our books, records, or information representing or containing Confidential Information to which you may be given access are books, records, and information to which solicitor-client privilege and/or litigation privilege (\u201cPrivilege\u201d) attaches. You recognize and acknowledge that we have a material interest in the preservation of Privilege in respect of all Privileged material (collectively, the \u201cPrivileged Material\u201d). You agree (acting on your own behalf and as agent for your Representatives) that: (a) such access is being provided solely for the Permitted Purpose; (b) such access is not intended and should not be interpreted as a waiver of any Privilege in respect of Privileged Material or any right to assert or claim Privilege in respect of Privileged Material. To the extent there is any waiver, it is intended to be a limited waiver in your favour, solely for the Permitted Purpose; (c) you shall keep the Privileged Material in strict confidence, and disclose such material solely to your legal counsel and to your directors, officers, and employees and any affiliate and only to the extent required for the Permitted Purpose; (d) at our request, all copies of Privileged Material, and any notes that would disclose the contents of Privileged Material, will be destroyed or returned to the owner thereof; and (e) at our request, you shall claim or assert, or co-operate to claim or assert, Privilege in respect of our Privileged Material.\n5. No Disclosure of Transaction \u2013 The Potential Bidder and its Representatives will not, without our prior written consent, disclose to any person the fact that the Confidential Information has been made available, that this NDA has been entered into, that discussions or negotiations are taking place or have taken place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction or the SISP.\n6. Contact Persons \u2013 In respect of Confidential Information requests or any other matters concerning the Confidential Information or the Transaction, you agree to communicate only with Deryck Helkaa and/or Dustin Olver, or with such other individual or individuals as they may authorize in writing. Without our prior written consent, neither you nor any of your Representatives will initiate or cause to be initiated or maintain any communication with any officer, director, agent, or employee of ours, or any affiliate, creditor, shareholder, customer, supplier, or lender of ours concerning our business, operations, prospects, or finances, or the Confidential Information or the Transaction.\n7. Proprietary Rights \u2013 You acknowledge that the Confidential Information is a proprietary asset of the Company and its affiliates and agree that, as between you and the Company, the Company will retain proprietary rights in the Confidential Information and the disclosure of such Confidential Information shall not be deemed to confer upon you any rights whatsoever in respect of any Confidential Information.\n8. Return of Confidential Information \u2013 If you determine not to pursue a Transaction, you will advise us of that fact forthwith upon such determination being made. At the time of such notice, or if, at any earlier time, we so direct (whether or not you determine to pursue a Transaction), you and your Representatives will, at your own expense, promptly return or destroy all copies of the Confidential Information upon our request (and, in any event, within five (5) business days after such request), except for that portion of the Confidential Information which consists of Derivative Information, which will be destroyed, and in the case of information stored in electronic form, it will be permanently erased. If requested by us, compliance with this Section 8 shall be certified in writing by an authorized officer of the Potential Bidder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing: (a) you may retain a copy of the Confidential Information to the extent that such retention is required to demonstrate compliance with applicable law, regulation, or professional standards, provided that it is kept strictly confidential; and (b) Confidential Information that is electronically stored may be retained in back-up servers if it is not intentionally made available to any person, and is deleted in accordance with your normal policies with respect to the retention of electronic records. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, you and your Representatives shall continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n9. No Representation \u2013 You acknowledge that neither we nor any of our Representatives make any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and agree that neither we nor our Representatives shall have any liability, direct or indirect, to you or your Representatives relating to or resulting from the Confidential Information or the use thereof, errors therein, or omissions therefrom and except in accordance with any specific representations and warranties made in any Definitive Agreement entered into regarding the Transaction. This NDA does not create any obligation between the Company and the Potential Bidder nor any of their respective Representatives to negotiate and enter into a Transaction.\n10. Definitive Agreement \u2013 You acknowledge and agree that no agreement relating to or providing for the Transaction shall exist unless and until a Definitive Agreement with respect to Transaction has been executed by you and us (or any of our affiliates). It is agreed that unless and until such a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered pursuant to the terms of the SISP, neither we nor you shall have any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the completion of the Transaction by virtue of this NDA except as otherwise contemplated by the SISP. We and you further understand and agree that: (a) we are under no obligation to provide Confidential Information and any data room containing Confidential Information may be closed by us at any time; and (b) you shall not have any claim whatsoever against us (nor any of our affiliates or Representatives) arising out of or relating to the completion of the Transaction (other than as expressly set forth in a subsequent Definitive Agreement entered into by us and you in connection with the Transaction and pursuant to the terms of the SISP). The process leading up to a Transaction shall be governed by the applicable terms of the SISP. Subject to the SISP, either party to this NDA may terminate discussions and negotiations with regard to the Transaction at any time for any reason.\n11. Required Disclosure \u2013 In the event that you or any of your Representatives become legally compelled or are required by regulatory authorities having appropriate jurisdiction to disclose any of the Confidential Information, you will promptly provide us with written notice so that we may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this NDA. You will cooperate with us on a reasonable basis to obtain a protective order or other remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or we waive compliance with the provisions of this NDA, you will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which you are advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information so furnished.\n12. Non-Solicitation; No-Hire \u2013 Without prior written consent of the Company, for a period of two (2) years from the date of this NDA (the \u201cRestriction Period\u201d), the Potential Bidder, its Representatives, and its affiliates will not, either directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ, or otherwise contract for the services of (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of us or any of our affiliates) any person who is now employed or engaged (either as an employee or consultant) or becomes employed or engaged during the term of this NDA by us in our operations, other than persons whose employment or engagement shall have been terminated at least six (6) months prior to the date of such solicitation, employment, or other contractual arrangements. The prohibition contained in this paragraph does not extend to general solicitations of employment by you not specifically directed towards our employees or consultants.\n13. Standstill \u2013 The Potential Bidder agrees that during the Restriction Period, neither you nor any of your affiliates (including any person or entity directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controlling you or controlled by or under common control with you) will, without the prior written authorization of the Company, directly, indirectly, or jointly or in concert with any other person: (a) purchase, offer, or agree to purchase any securities (including equity and debt securities), direct or indirect rights, or options to acquire securities, bank indebtedness, trade claims, or other liabilities of the Company or assets of ours or any of our affiliates; (b) enter into, offer, or agree to enter into or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any acquisition or other business combination transaction relating to us or any of our affiliates, or any acquisition transaction relating to all or part of the assets of the Company, any of our affiliates or any of their respective businesses, or propose any of the foregoing; (c) solicit proxies from our shareholders or otherwise attempt to influence the conduct of our shareholders or the voting of any of our or any of our affiliates\u2019 voting securities; (d) form, join, or in any way participate in any group acting jointly or in concert with respect to the foregoing; (e) seek any modification to or waiver of your agreements and obligations under this NDA; (f) seek, propose, or otherwise act alone or in concert with others, to influence or control the management, board of directors, or policies of the Company or any of our affiliates; (g) advise, assist, or encourage, act as a financing source for, or otherwise invest in any other person in connection with any of the foregoing activities; or (h) disclose any intention, plan, or arrangement, or take any action inconsistent with the foregoing.\n14. Amendment of Agreement \u2013 This NDA may not be amended, modified, or waived except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.\n15. Successors and Assigns; Assignability \u2013 This NDA shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. This NDA may not be assigned by the Potential Bidder without the prior written consent of the Company. Any assignment or attempted assignment in contravention of this subsection shall be void ab initio and shall not relieve the assigning party of any obligation under this NDA.\n16. Certain Definitions \u2013 In this NDA, the term \u201caffiliate\u201d shall mean a person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under common control with, us or you, as the case may be, with \u201ccontrol\u201d meaning direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the voting securities or similar rights or interests of such person. The term \u201cperson\u201d shall be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, association, trust, firm, unincorporated organization, or other entity of any kind or nature.\n17. Governing Law \u2013 This NDA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable in the Province of Alberta. You hereby irrevocably: (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta, Judicial District of Calgary in respect of any actions or proceedings (\u201cProceedings\u201d) relating in any way to this NDA and the transactions contemplated hereby (and you agree not to commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in such courts); and (b) waive any objection to the venue of any Proceeding relating to this NDA or the transactions contemplated hereby in the courts of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Alberta, including the objection that any such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n18. Non-Waiver \u2013 No failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this NDA will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege under this NDA.\n19. Notice \u2013 Any notice, consent, or approval required or permitted to be given in connection with this NDA (\u201cNotice\u201d) shall be in writing and shall be sufficiently given if delivered (whether in person, by courier service, or other personal method of delivery):\n(a) to the Receiver:\nFTI Consulting Canada Inc.\n720, 440 2 Avenue S.W.\nCalgary, Alberta T2P 5E9\nAttention: Dustin Olver\nTelephone: (403) 454-6032\nFax: (403) 232-6116\nEmail: dustin.olver@fticonsulting.com\n(b) to the Potential Bidder:\n[NTD: Insert contact information]\nAny Notice delivered or transmitted as provided above shall be deemed to have been given and received on the day it is delivered or transmitted, provided that it is delivered or transmitted on a business day prior to 5:00 p.m. local time in the place of delivery or receipt.

Indemnity \u2013 The Potential Bidder shall indemnify and hold harmless us and our Representatives from any damages, loss, cost, or liability (including reasonable legal fees and the cost of enforcing this indemnity) arising out of or resulting from any breach of this NDA by the Potential Bidder or any of its Representatives.\n21. Injunctive Relief \u2013 You acknowledge that disclosure of the Confidential Information or other breach of this NDA would cause serious and irreparable damage and harm to us and that remedies at law would be inadequate to protect against breach of this NDA, and agree in advance to the granting of injunctive relief in our favour for any breach of the provisions of this NDA and to the specific enforcement of the terms of this NDA, without proof of actual damages, and without the requirement to post a bond or other security, in addition to any other remedy to which we would be entitled.\n22. Term \u2013 Except as otherwise provided herein, confidentiality and non-use obligations described in this NDA shall terminate upon the expiration of the Restriction Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that the confidentiality and non-use obligations in this NDA pertaining to Personal Information shall survive any termination or expiration of this NDA.\n23. Severability \u2013 If any provision or portion of any provision of this NDA is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision or portion of that provision will be severed from this NDA, with the rest of this NDA remaining in full force and effect.\n24. Counterparts \u2013 This NDA may be executed and delivered by electronic transmission. An electronic signature shall have the same legal effect as a manual signature.

Ross & Moncure also agrees to only request of the Client information necessary to carry out services requested by the Client.\nRoss & Moncure shall process information and data provided in accordance with the instructions given by the Client and shall refrain from recording, reproducing, or storing data for superfluous reasons.

Brown Act (California Government Code section 54950 et seq.), subpoena, or any other legally permitted or required disclosure, the Parties agree not to disclose the other\u2019s Confidential Information to third parties except to those employees of a recipient who are required to have the information for the purposes in this Agreement, Representatives (defined below), and except as otherwise allowed in this Agreement; and\n\uf0a7 The Parties will use and disclose the other\u2019s Confidential Information only for purposes of evaluating and engaging in an actual or potential business relationship with each other.\nb.

These steps must be at least as protective as those we take to protect our own Confidential Information of a similar nature;\n\uf0a7 To notify the other promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information; and\n\uf0a7 To cooperate with the other to help regain control of the Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure of it.\nc.

Each Party agrees that use of information in its Representatives\u2019 unaided memories in the development or deployment of the Parties\u2019 respective products or services does not create liability for that Party under this Agreement or trade secret law. Both Parties mutually agree to limit what each Party discloses to the other accordingly.\nd. Disclosing Confidential Information if required to by law. Each Party may disclose the other\u2019s Confidential Information if required to comply with a court order, law, or other government demand that has the force of law including, but not limited to, the California Public Records Act, California Government Code section 6250 et seq. If a Party is required to disclose the other Party\u2019s Confidential Information pursuant to applicable law, statute, or regulation, or court order, that Party will give to the other written notice of the order or request mandating disclosure of the Confidential Information in order to provide a reasonable opportunity for the other Party to object to such disclosure of its Confidential Information and seek a protective order or appropriate remedy.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n[Name]______________________________________ [Address]_______________________ and [Name]_____________________________ [Address]_____________________________ agree to enter into a mutual confidential business relationship for the purpose of ____________________________________________________________________________. In order to achieve this purpose, each party may acquire valuable trade secrets and/or confidential and proprietary information of the other party or its affiliates. In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby agreed that:\n1. Confidential Information means all confidential and proprietary information which is disclosed by one party to the other party and is clearly labeled as confidential or proprietary or is disclosed orally is followed up in writing within 30 days of the oral disclosure identifying the subject matter which is confidential or proprietary.\n2. Each party agrees not to use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever except for the purposes set forth above. Each party agrees not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third person and only disclose the confidential information to its employees and those of its affiliates who have a need to know and who agree to keep such information confidential. Each party agrees that it shall protect the confidentiality of, and take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure or unauthorized use of, the Confidential Information in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons not legally bound to maintain its confidentiality, provided that in no event shall such party's obligations exceed the reasonable standard of care taken to protect its own confidential information of like importance. Each party will promptly advise the other party in writing of any misappropriation or misuse by any person of such Confidential Information and provide assistance to the injured party in any legal proceedings related thereto. Each party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder survive in accordance with the terms hereof, notwithstanding the termination of the business relationship of the parties, for a period of two (2) years following the last disclosure of Confidential Information by the other party hereunder.\n3. No copies of any Confidential Information may be made except to implement the purposes of this Agreement. Any materials, documents, notes, memoranda, software code, drawings, sketches and other tangible items containing, consisting of or relating to the Confidential Information of a party which are furnished hereunder to the other party, or are in the possession of the other party, remain the property of the party which disclosed the Confidential Information and shall be promptly returned to such party upon the disclosing party\u2019s request therefore. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, in any Confidential Information except as specified in this Agreement.\n4. Each party's obligations under this Agreement shall not apply to information which: (a) is known by the receiving party or is publicly available at the time of disclosure; (b) becomes publicly available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no act of either party; (c) is hereafter rightfully furnished to the receiving party by a third party without restriction as to use or disclosure; (d) is disclosed with the prior written consent of the disclosing party; (e) is information that was independently developed by the receiving party; or (f) is required to be disclosed pursuant to any judicial or administrative proceeding, provided that the receiving party promptly notifies the disclosing party of such action and gives the disclosing party the opportunity to seek any legal remedies to maintain such information in confidence.\n5. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate either party to disclose any information to the other party or enter into any other agreement with the other party. Each party acknowledges that if the other party is required to bring an action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the damages will be irreparable and difficult to measure and that the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief including a preliminary injunction in addition to any other relief available. Should litigation arise concerning this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to its attorneys' fees and court costs in addition to any other relief which may be awarded. This Agreement shall be governed by Arizona law without regard to provisions concerning conflicts of laws. This Agreement and any exhibits attached hereto are the complete and exclusive statement regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supercede all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral and written, between the parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. A waiver of any breach or failure to enforce any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time shall not in any way affect, limit or waive a party's right thereafter to enforce and compel compliance with this Agreement.

For the purposes of this agreement:\n(a) \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d means the party disclosing any Information, and shall include any entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or under common ownership or control with the Disclosing Party\n(b) \u201cRecipient\u201d means the party receiving any Information, and shall include any entity that owns or controls, is owned or controlled by or under common ownership or control with the Recipient.\n(c) \u201cMaterials\u201d means media of any nature on which information is stored or represented;\n(d) \u201cInformation\u201d means:\n(i) Disclosing Party\u2019s non-public information and material of whatever nature relating to the Disclosing Party\u2019s activities, undertakings, technology, know-how, intellectual property, assets, positions, strategy and products (including without limitation information relating to management, financial, marketing, commercial, technical and other arrangements of the Disclosing Party and the affairs of its clients, current, former or prospective customers and suppliers) and/or the Materials which is obtained by the Recipient or any Designated Person as a result or in consequence of access to or inspection of the Materials by the Recipient or any Designated Person or which is provided to the Recipient or any Designated Person either in writing or in pictorial or machine-readable form or orally from or pursuant to discussions with the management, employees or officers of the Disclosing Party, or any agent, contractor or adviser to the Disclosing Party;\n(ii) any reports, analyses, data, plans, compilations, studies and other documents prepared by the Recipient, its employees, agents or advisers which contains or otherwise reflects or are generated from any such information as is specified in paragraph (i) above and the contents thereof;\n(iii) the contents of this agreement.\n2. In consideration of Information being made accessible or available to the Recipient or to any of the Recipient\u2019s directors, officers, employees, advisers or agents, the Recipient undertakes to the Disclosing Party as follows:\n3. The Recipient will use the Information only for the purpose of collaboration or trade with the Disclosing Party and shall not otherwise use or exploit any of the information for its own or any other person\u2019s gain, benefit or purpose and, in particular but without limitation, it will not use any of the Information for commercial or competitive purposes.\n4. The Recipient will not (directly or indirectly) at any time, without the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent, disclose or reveal or permit access to the Information, in whole or in part, to any person other than its employees and agents with a need to know in connection with the performance of the collaboration or trade with the Disclosing Party.\n5. The Recipient will treat and safeguard as private and confidential and take reasonable steps necessary or desirable to maintain the confidentiality and security of all Information received at any time by it.\n6. The Recipient will not in any form or manner copy or reproduce or part with possession of any Information or Materials or any other documents or other material or data made available to it or disclosed or procured to be disclosed by the Disclosing Party except as consistent with its obligations under this agreement and in particular (but without limitation) its obligations under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above.\n7. All of the Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and the disclosure of such Information and the Recipient access to the Materials shall not be deemed to confer upon the Recipient any rights or licence whatsoever in respect of any part of the Information or Materials.\n8. If the Disclosing Party so requests in writing at any time, the Recipient will forthwith return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all Information and Materials together with all copies, records, analyses, memoranda or other notes to the extent containing or reflecting any of the Information made by it or its directors, officers, employees, agents of advisers. In addition the Recipient, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisers will erase all Information from any computer, word processor or other device containing Information in its or their possession, custody or control.\n9. The confidentiality obligations and undertakings set out in this agreement do not apply to:\n(a) information which now is or hereafter comes into the public domain, otherwise than by reason of a breach of this agreement; or\n(b) information the disclosure of which is required by law provided that if the Recipient, its agents, advisers, or employees become legally obligated to disclose such information, prompt notice of such fact shall be given to the Disclosing Party, to the extent permitted by law, prior to making any disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate remedy to prevent such disclosure or waive compliance with the provisions of this agreement and the Recipient, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisers shall fully co-operate with the Disclosing Party if the Disclosing Party elects to challenge the validity of such requirement and/or take such steps as the Disclosing Party may reasonably require to avoid or limit such disclosure.\n(c) information made available to the Recipient from other sources without obligation of confidentiality.\n(d) information that is already in the possession of or independently developed by the Recipient.\n10. The Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness of the Information or Materials, and the Recipient agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its respective directors, officers, employees, advisers and agents shall have any liability to it, its directors, officers, employees, advisers or agents resulting from the furnishing or use of the Information or Materials. In furnishing or making available the Information or Materials, the Disclosing Party undertakes no obligation to provide the Recipient, its directors, officers, employees, advisers or agents with access to any additional information or to update the Information or Materials or correct inaccuracies therein which may become apparent and neither the Disclosing Party nor any other person shall be liable for any direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage suffered by any person as a result of relying on any statement contained in or omitted from the Information or Materials, whether caused by the negligence of the Disclosing Party or otherwise.\n11. The Recipient agrees to indemnify, and to keep indemnified, each of the Disclosing Party, its directors, officers, employees, advisers and agents and each of them against all actions, claims, liabilities, damages, costs, charges and expenses which the Disclosing Party, its directors, officers, employees, advisers and agents (or any of them) may suffer or incur in connection with or arising out of any breach by the Recipient or by any other person to whom the Recipient has disclosed or given access to any part of the Information, of any of the provisions of this agreement.\n12. Should any provision of this agreement become illegal or void for any reason, the validity of the remaining provision shall not be affected and the Recipient shall enter into negotiations in good faith with the Disclosing Party to find a replacement for the provision which is of similar economic effect to both parties.\n13. No forbearance or failure by the Disclosing Party to exercise or assert or claim any right or entitlement hereunder shall be construed (in the absence of a written agreement to waive or a written confirmation of a past waiver) as a waiver of that right or entitlement. No waiver of any breach of any term of this agreement shall (unless expressly agreed in writing by the Disclosing Party) be construed as a waiver of a future breach of the same term or as authorising a continuation of a particular breach.\n14. The Recipient recognises and acknowledges the Disclosing Party\u2019s representation of the competitive value and confidential nature of the Information and Materials and that any use or disclosure of the Information or Materials other than as expressly authorised by this agreement will be detrimental to the Disclosing Party, and may result in the Disclosing Party suffering substantial and irreparable loss and damage. Without affecting any other rights or remedies that any party may have, the Recipient acknowledges and agrees that due to the character of the Information to be made available hereunder, damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach by it or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers of the provisions of this agreement, and that the Disclosing Party will be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the provisions of this agreement by the Recipient or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers and that no proof of special damage or special damages shall be necessary for the enforcement of this agreement. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall, however, be construed as a waiver by the Disclosing Party of any other rights, including without limitation, rights for damages.\n15. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that its obligations under this agreement shall be continuing and, in particular, they shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall not be affected by any discussions between the Recipient and the Disclosing Party regarding the Information or Materials.\n16. The Disclosing Party retains sole ownership and title to the Information and Materials at all times. The Recipient shall keep the Materials free of liens, attachments, and other encumbrances.\n17.

This definition also includes any Confidential Information disclosed by or to any affiliate or subsidiary of the Company. Recipient understands and agrees that Company\u2019s client and prospective client lists, proposals, reports, all internal memoranda and documents and any information communicated to Recipient, written or oral, that is indicated as confidential, are trade secrets within the meaning of Chapter 19.108 of the Revised Code of Washington, and that misappropriation of such information, as defined in said Chapter, shall subject Recipient to penalties as set forth in said Chapter. Confidential Information shall not include information (i) which was lawfully in the possession of Recipient prior to disclosure of such information by the Company; (ii) which was, or at any time becomes, available in the public domain other than through a violation of this Agreement; (iii) which is documented, to the satisfaction of both Parties, by Recipient as having been developed by Recipient independently; or (iv) which is furnished to Recipient or its representatives by a third party not under an obligation of and without a violation of confidentiality to the Company.\n2. Recipient agrees not to disclose Confidential Information to any third party, except as specifically authorized by this Agreement or as specifically authorized by the Company in writing. Recipient agrees to hold all of the Confidential Information in trust and confidence and agrees that it shall be used only by Recipient or its employees with a need-to-know for the contemplated purpose set forth above, and shall not be used for any other purpose or disclosed to any party who is not bound by a non-disclosure agreement with the Company.\n3. Recipient agrees to use all reasonable precautions, no less than Recipient\u2019s treatment of its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of the Company\u2019s Confidential Information.\n4. The Confidential Information, regardless of whether it is in oral or written, or partial or complete, form, shall be and remain the property of the Company, whether provided to or copied by Recipient. Recipient shall not make or have made any partial or complete copies or derivative works, whether in hand copy or electronic form, of any of the Confidential Information without the express prior authorization of the Company, and any legends or notices used by the Company in the Confidential Information shall be reproduced in full in all copies. Upon demand by the Company or termination of this Agreement, all materials bearing or disclosing any of the Confidential Information shall be delivered or returned to the Company.\n5. This Agreement applies to all Confidential Information that is disclosed by the Company to Recipient during the period that begins on the Effective Date. The obligations of this Agreement will remain in effect for as long as the Confidential Information remains confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of the Company. Or, if the Parties enter into a subsequent agreement governing the disclosure of Confidential Information, this Agreement will terminate and that subsequent agreement shall control the use and disclosure of Confidential Information.\n6. Recipient may disclose the Company\u2019s Confidential Information if and only to the extent that a disclosure is required by applicable law, provided that Recipient uses reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure by means of a protective order or a request for Confidential/Attorneys\u2019 Eyes Only treatment that permits the Company a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure before it is made, and to interpose its own objection to the disclosure and, if appropriate, bring a motion for a protective order.\n7. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights to Recipient, by license or otherwise, to any of the Company\u2019s Confidential Information, except as specifically stated in this Agreement.\n8. Recipient acknowledges that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and, accordingly, without prejudice to any and all other rights and remedies that the Company might have, the Company shall be entitled without proof of special damage to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the provisions of this Agreement without the requirement of posting a bond. Recipient agrees that the Company shall be entitled to an award of its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expert fees and costs if it prevails in any action to enforce this Agreement.\n9. This Agreement shall be governed and construed under the laws of the State of Washington. Recipient irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive and mandatory jurisdiction of the state courts sitting in Skagit County, Washington or the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, and agrees that any action, suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in such courts to the exclusion of all other courts, other than actions to enforce judgments or orders entered in said courts.\n10. If any provision of this Agreement or compliance by any of the Parties with any provision of this Agreement constitutes a violation of any law, or is or becomes unenforceable or void, then such provision, to the extent only that it is in violation of law, unenforceable or void, shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary so that it is no longer in violation of law, unenforceable or void, and such provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If such modification is not possible, said provision, to the extent that it is in violation of law, unenforceable or void, shall be deemed severable from the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which provisions will remain binding on the Parties.\n11. This Agreement sets forth the complete and exclusive agreement of the Parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and communications, oral or written, between the Parties regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not, however, intended to limit any rights that the Company may have under trade secret, copyright, patent or other laws that may apply to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n12.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nCompensair Pte.Ltd, a private company limited by shares, incorporated under the laws of Singapore under company number 201913904W and having registered office at 10 Anson Road #09-03, International Plaza, Singapore 079903 (hereinafter \u2013 \u201cDiscloser\u201d), cooperating with the Agents pursuant to the Contract for client acquisition (hereinafter \u2013 \u201cRecipient\u201d), enter into the Non-disclosure Agreement (hereinafter \u2013 \u201cAgreement\u201d) on the following terms (hereinafter \u2013 the \u201cTerms\u201d).\n1. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement the following terms have the meanings specified for them:\n1.1. \u201cAffiliate\u201d means any corporation, company or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party to this Agreement. An entity is regarded as in control of another or owning another if it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors or other persons performing similar functions.\n1.2. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d \u2013 Confidential Information is any information of the Discloser of actual or potential commercial value owing to the fact that it is unknown to third parties; disclosed by the Discloser to the Recipient in writing, by way of document delivery, including in an electronic format safeguarded from unauthorised access to the information in transit; related to business or financial plans or strategies, financial reports or accounting (except to the extent contemplated by the law), contractual relations, pricing and marketing of goods, products or services, technical information, commercial secrets, know-how, research, production plans, concepts, intellectual property items (including inventions, discoveries, innovative ideas, useful models, designs, production prototypes not covered by patent for whatever reason, computer programmes, databases, trademark designs not registered for whatever reason).\nNo information which has become public and to which the Discloser has provided access for third parties without limitation or which has become public other than through the fault of the Recipient (but not before it becomes publicly circulated), which the Recipient is able to prove that it had been in the possession of before it was disclosed by the Discloser or that such information was provided without liability to maintain confidentiality, will be deemed confidential.\nNo information which the Recipient is able to prove it has created without using Confidential Information will be deemed confidential.\n1.3. \u201cDiscloser\u201d means the party disclosing Confidential Information under this Agreement.\n1.4. \u201cRecipient\u201d means the party receiving Confidential Information under this Agreement.\n2. Subject of the Agreement. Parties\u2019 obligations to maintain confidentiality of Confidential Information on the terms provided by this Agreement constitute the subject of this Agreement.\n2.1. The Discloser will disclose to the Recipient confidential information related to implementation of a service for receiving compensation for delayed and canceled flights.\n2.2. The Recipient and its Representatives having access to Confidential Information must use Confidential Information exclusively for the purposes for which Confidential Information was disclosed and not use it for any other purpose.\n2.3. Neither Party will disclose the fact of existence of this Agreement without prior approval from the other Party.\n2.4. The Recipient will ensure that information is stored securely and cannot be accessed by any individuals, except the Representatives, including outside business hours.\n2.5. In the event that any fact of Confidential Information disclosure to third parties becomes known to the Recipient, it will contact the Discloser immediately, advising of such a fact and of any actions it is taking to reduce the damage.\n3. Permitted Use. Recipient shall keep Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information confidential and use Confidential Information only for the above-stated Purpose of Disclosure, or for performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information internally within its organization (including Affiliates) only on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis, and except for Cardholder Information which shall not be disclosed, to its outside attorneys, consultants, contractors and sub-contractors (\u201cRepresentatives\u201d), only to the extent those individuals are bound by a legal obligation or agreement that is as protective of the Confidential Information as this Agreement. A Recipient is fully responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any of its Affiliates or Representatives. A Recipient shall use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as it uses to prevent unauthorized disclosure of its own Confidential Information. Except for the permitted uses and disclosures expressly set out in this Agreement, no other uses or disclosures are permitted.\n3.1. A failure to comply with Clause 3.1 of this Agreement will serve good ground for terminating access to Confidential Information, whereby the Discloser becomes entitled to a unilateral refusal to execution of any agreements made between the Parties, by which the Recipient is to receive or has received access to Confidential Information.\n3.2. In the event that the confidentiality terms in the agreements made by the Parties, by which the Recipient is to be or has been given access to the Confidential Information, and in this Agreement prove to be contradictory, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.\n4. Exceptions. This Agreement imposes no obligation on a Recipient with respect to Confidential Information that:\n(a) is or becomes publicly known through no breach of this Agreement;\n(b) is rightfully received by the Recipient from a third party that has no applicable duty of confidentiality;\n(c) is or becomes the subject of a patent, in which case a party shall rely upon its rights under applicable patent law;\n(d) is disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written consent of the Discloser. A party also may disclose Confidential Information if required by court order, governmental demand, or other compulsory legal process, provided that if legally permitted to do so it first notify the Discloser in writing at least ten (10) days in advance in order to afford Discloser an opportunity to seek a protective order or other relief.\n5. Mandatory Disclosure. If the Recipient is required by the law to disclose Confidential Information, it will advise the Discloser immediately. The Recipient undertakes to disclose information exclusively to the extent required by the applicable law.\n6. Ownership. As between the parties, Discloser and Recipient, respectively, will retain all right, title and interest to any Confidential Information provided or disclosed by such party under this Agreement. The Discloser reserves the right to analyze the actions taken by the Recipient to safeguard Confidential Information. If the Recipient refuses to share information on the actions it is taking to safeguard Confidential Information or if such actions are found to be inadequate for safeguarding Confidential Information, the Discloser may refuse to disclose Confidential Information or unilaterally refuse to perform under any agreement made between the Parties, by which the Recipient is to receive or has received access to Confidential Information.\n7. Return or Destruction. Upon Discloser\u2019s written request, a Recipient shall promptly return all Confidential Information received under this Agreement, together with all copies, or certify in writing that it has destroyed all such materials.\n8. No Commitment. Each party acknowledges that the other party may be evaluating similar business opportunities or proposals with third parties, or developing systems, products, or services that are similar in nature to the other party\u2019s current or planned offerings. Nothing in this Agreement limits the right of either party to develop, procure or market systems, products, or services that may be similar to or competitive with those of the other party; provided that no unauthorized use or disclosure of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information is used in such activities. In addition, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prevent either party from entering into negotiations or business relationships with any third party, even if such third party is a competitor of a party to this Agreement.\n9. No Licenses or Joint Venture. No party acquires any intellectual property rights under this Agreement (including patent, copyright, or trademark rights). Neither party shall make any use of the trademarks, trade names, or service marks of the other party without express written consent.\n10. Liability of the parties. A Party defaulting under this Agreement will reimburse the other Party for any loss resulting from disclosure or unlawful use of Confidential Information. Losses will be reimbursed according to the law of Singapore.\n11. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that improper disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to the Discloser, and that remedies at law for any such breach could be inadequate. In the event of a breach or threatened breach, Discloser has the right to seek injunctive relief (in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or equity) without the need to post a bond or other security or demonstrate the confidential nature of its Confidential Information. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement is entitled to its reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in connection with any dispute arising under this Agreement.\n12. No Obligation to Disclose. This Agreement does not obligate any party to disclose Confidential Information. By disclosing Confidential Information, however, the Discloser represents and warrants that it has all rights necessary to make the disclosure.\n13. Duration of Obligations. Recipient\u2019s obligations under this Agreement end five (5) years after the date of first disclosure hereunder.\n14. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such assignment or transfer without written consent will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.\n15. Notices. All notices under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered by hand, overnight delivery, or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Contacts for Legal Notice and Business Information Exchange identified above.\n16. Governing Law. The terms of this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by 3 (three) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Singapore, Singapore. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Parties from applying for a preliminary or injunctive remedy available under applicable laws for any purpose.\n17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to such subject matter.\n18. Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will be severed with the rest of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect.\n"",","nondisclosure, agreementncompensair, pteltd, private, company, limited, share, incorporated, law, singapore, company, number, 201913904w, registered, office, 10, anson, road, 0903,

SUPPLIER\u2019S DUTY OF NON-DISCLOSURE\nA. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all confidential, proprietary, or non-public information of the Disclosing Parties (however recorded or preserved) that is disclosed or made available, directly or indirectly, by CGSH or its respective employees, officers, representatives or advisors to the Supplier or its affiliates, representatives, employees or agents, relating to the business of such Disclosing Party or that otherwise by its nature would be reasonably understood as confidential, whether provided in written or oral form and in any manner whatsoever. Without limiting the foregoing, Confidential Information may include confidential or proprietary information owned by a third party and used under license by a Disclosing Party.\nB. The Supplier agrees that it may only access and interact with any Confidential Information made available to it to the extent necessary for it to perform the Services. The Supplier further agrees that, as a recipient of Confidential Information: (i) except as expressly permitted by an applicable Services Agreement, it shall not, for any purpose, use, disclose, reproduce, transfer or reduce to writing or otherwise record the Confidential Information; (ii) it shall maintain in confidence the Confidential Information and shall, with respect to such Confidential Information, use the same degree of care and exercise reasonable efforts to protect such Confidential Information as it uses and exercises with respect to protecting its own similar confidential and/or proprietary information, but in all events no less than reasonable efforts and care; (iii) it shall only disclose Confidential Information to those of its or its affiliates\u2019 employees (a) to whom it is necessary to disclose such Confidential Information for performance of the Services, (b) to whom it has advised of the terms of this Agreement, and (c) who have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement; (iv) it shall cause the employees to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to Section 1.B(iii) to comply with the terms of this Agreement, and it shall be responsible for such compliance and fully liable for any failure to comply; and (v) except as set forth in Section 1.B(iii), it shall not disclose or in any way disseminate or make available any Confidential Information disclosed or otherwise made available to it or in its possession to any other party.\nC. The Supplier shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it and its affiliates, and their respective representatives, employees and agents, and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent such parties from using, disclosing, reproducing, transferring, reducing to writing or otherwise recording the Confidential Information as prohibited by this Agreement. If it becomes known to the Supplier that (i) it or its affiliates, representatives, employees or agents have breached any of the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) facts and/or circumstances exist that could be reasonably expected to result in disclosure of any Confidential Information, the Supplier shall in each case immediately notify CGSH of such breach, facts and/or circumstances, and, in the case of (ii), shall use its best efforts to remedy the facts and/or circumstances that would lead to such disclosure (to the extent such facts and/or circumstances may be within the Supplier\u2019s control upon such exercise of best efforts).\nD. The Supplier agrees that the restrictions on use and disclosure of Confidential Information under this Agreement shall not apply to the Supplier for information that: (i) is now or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of the Supplier, generally known or available to the public other than through a breach of an obligation of confidentiality to CGSH; (ii) was known to the Supplier prior to encountering such information from the performance of its Services; (iii) was lawfully obtained by the Supplier from third parties, provided that such third parties were not restricted or obligated to keep such information confidential; or (iv) is required to be disclosed by law, any order of court or any competent regulatory authority, subject to the further provisions of this clause. In the event that the Supplier is required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the requirements of applicable law, rules, regulations, court or other governmental authority, the Supplier shall provide prompt advance notice (in writing, if practical) to CGSH in order to enable CGSH to contest such requirement of disclosure or seek an appropriate protective order, and shall disclose such Confidential Information only to the extent the Supplier reasonably determines it is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information and with respect to which it agrees to exercise its best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded therefor.\nE. Confidential Information disclosed or made available under this Agreement and any intellectual property or proprietary rights therein are and shall remain the property of CGSH. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to imply the grant of any license to make, use or sell or otherwise commercialize any Confidential Information. Further, the Supplier acknowledges that any Confidential Information disclosed or made available to it is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and that EACH DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CORRECTNESS OR COMPLETENESS OF SUCH CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES.\nF. Upon the termination of the Services for any reason or at the written request of a Disclosing Party at any time, the Supplier shall destroy (and promptly deliver a certification of such destruction) or promptly deliver to each Disclosing Party, or to the requesting Disclosing Party as the case may be, all tangible embodiments of such Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information in the Supplier\u2019s or its employees\u2019 possession, including but not limited to copies, notes, packages, pictures, diagrams, computer memory media and all other tangible embodiments of, or materials containing, any portion of the Confidential Information.\n2. DATA PROTECTION\nEach Party shall (and shall procure that each of its relevant affiliates shall), and shall use reasonable endeavors to procure that any third party subcontractors shall, comply with their respective obligations under all applicable law regarding data protection in relation to all Personal Data and Confidential Information (together, \u201cProtected Data\u201d) that is processed by it in the course of performing its obligations under this Agreement, and take such steps as are reasonably required by the other Party to ensure that the other Party is able to comply with such law. This includes maintaining a valid and up to date registration or notification under applicable law relating to data protection. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d and \u201cprocessed\u201d (when used in the context of Personal Data) have the meanings given to those terms in the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the applicable implementing legislation in any country including the Data Protection Act 1998 (the \u201cData Protection Laws\u201d).\nCGSH acknowledges that, to the extent the Supplier is a data processor within the meaning of the Data Protection Laws, the Supplier shall (and shall use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that its sub-contractors shall) (i) only process Confidential Information, including any client data, in accordance with CGSH\u2019s instructions and (ii) bring into effect and maintain all reasonable technical and organizational measures to maintain security, prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to or processing of Personal Data, and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing the measures, so as to ensure a level of security appropriate to: (A) the harm that may result from breach of those measures; and (B) the nature of the Personal Data to be protected.\nFurther, the Data Protection Laws make it mandatory that CGSH obtain contractual guarantees from all third parties who will be given access to or who become aware of Protected Data during the course of their visits to the Premises in order that they may undertake the role of a service provider. The Data Protection Laws also require CGSH to ensure they have measures in place to prevent the unauthorized or unlawful use of Protected Data and to prevent accidental loss, destruction or damage to any personal information. The Supplier must therefore ensure, by way of written contract between it and its employees, subcontractors and individuals visiting the Premises on the Supplier\u2019s behalf (each a \u201cContractor\u201d and, together, the \u201cContractors\u201d), that if at any time a Contractor becomes aware of Protected Data the Supplier or its Contractors will not (i) share this information with anyone outside of CGSH, (ii) take any information away from the Premises, and/or (iii) duplicate or copy any Protected Data.\n3. SURVIVAL; REMEDY\nA. This Agreement and the obligations herein shall survive indefinitely, regardless of whether or not the Supplier is still providing Services at the Premises.\nB. The Supplier acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of a Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information or any breach of this Agreement by the Supplier may cause such Disclosing Party to suffer irreparable injury not compensable by monetary damages and for which such Disclosing Party may not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Supplier agrees that CGSH will have the right to seek, without the posting of any bond or security or the giving of any undertaking as to damages or otherwise, specific performance or other injunctive or equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary or desirable to prevent, curtail or remedy any such unauthorized use or disclosure, whether threatened or actual. The rights of CGSH set forth in this paragraph shall be in addition to, and without prejudice to, any other rights that CGSH may have hereunder, whether at law or in equity.\n4. MISCELLANEOUS\nA. To the extent any applicable Services Agreement contains terms with respect to confidentiality that conflict with, or are less restrictive with respect to the Supplier\u2019s obligations than, those set forth in Sections 1-3 herein, the terms of this Agreement govern.\nB. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The Parties hereby agree and consent to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the County and State of New York with respect to claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement.\nC. All notices, requests, consents, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and received when sent by first class mail at any general or branch post office enclosed in a registered or certified postpaid envelope, addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth at the beginning of this Agreement, with a copy to the attention of the respective Parties as follows:\nCGSH: Purchasing & Supply Group\nSupplier: [e.g. General Counsel,]\nor to such changed address as such Parties may have fixed by notice; provided, however, that any notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule, law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, such provision shall be construed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting and reducing such provision so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent under applicable law and consistent with the original intent of the Parties. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties as to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind and every nature between the Parties. Any and all prior arrangements, representations, promises, understandings and conditions in connection with such matter, and any representations, promises or conditions not expressly incorporated herein or expressly made a part hereof shall not be binding upon any Party. This Agreement shall not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between the Parties and shall not be construed to create any obligation on the part of either Party to retain the services of or to compensate the other Party in any manner. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the day and year first above written.\n[Signature page follows]\nCleary Gottlieb Steen &

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is dated _______ ___, 2018 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), and is between QEP Energy Company (\u201cOwner\u201d), a Delaware corporation, and _____________________ (the \u201cReceiving Company\u201d), a ______ ______________. Owner and the Receiving Company are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\nR E C I T A L S\nWHEREAS, Owner has in its possession the Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) relating to Owner\u2019s and certain of its Affiliates\u2019 assets and properties located in the Williston Basin in Dunn, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota (collectively, the \u201cProperties\u201d);\nWHEREAS, in order for the Receiving Company to determine its interest in entering into a transaction with Owner and/or certain of its Affiliates regarding the potential sale, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of the Properties (the \u201cTransaction\u201d), Owner is willing to disclose on a non-exclusive basis certain Confidential Information to the Receiving Company for the sole purpose of the Receiving Company\u2019s review and evaluation of the Transaction, provided that the Receiving Company agrees to and accepts the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and\nWHEREAS, the Receiving Company is willing to agree to keep the Confidential Information confidential and to use such information only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\nA G R E E M E N T\n1. Nondisclosure of Confidential Information.\n(a) The Receiving Company (x) shall not use, and shall cause each of its Representatives (as hereinafter defined) not to use, any Confidential Information (including any portion thereof) for any purpose other than in connection with the Receiving Company\u2019s evaluation of the potential Transaction, and (y) shall, and shall cause each of its Representatives to, keep strictly confidential at all times and not disclose any Confidential Information except as expressly permitted hereunder. The Confidential Information may be disclosed by the Receiving Company to any of the Receiving Company\u2019s Representatives, but only if and to the limited extent that such Representative needs to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating the potential Transaction. It is understood that prior to any disclosure by Receiving Company to such Representatives, that (i) such Representatives shall be informed by the Receiving Company of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and the requirement that the same shall not be used other than for the purpose described above; (ii) such Representatives shall be required to agree to and be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a condition of receiving the Confidential Information; and (iii) in any event, the Receiving Company shall be liable for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any of its Representatives as if such Representatives were a Receiving Party hereunder. The Receiving Company shall not (and shall cause its Representatives not to) disclose the Confidential Information to any person other than as permitted hereby, and the Receiving Company shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by using at least the same degree of care that the Receiving Company uses in connection with its own confidential information of similar kind (but in any event no less than a reasonable degree of care).\n(b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) a person\u2019s \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall be the Affiliates, and the officers, directors, managers, members, shareholders, partners, employees, agents, representatives, consultants, principals, attorneys, accountants, advisors and potential financing sources, of such person, and of each of their Affiliates; (ii) the term \u201cperson\u201d shall be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any entity, company, corporation, trust, group, limited liability company, partnership or individual; and (iii) the term \u201cAffiliate\u201d is defined as any person that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the person specified. For purposes of the term Affiliate, \u201ccontrol\u201d means the power to direct or cause the direction of the management of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, agency, or otherwise.\n2. Definition of \u201cConfidential Information\u201d.\n(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means, collectively, any and all information, materials or data (whether written, electronic, video or oral) which concerns, relates to, or is associated in any way with Owner, its Affiliates, the Properties or the Transaction, that is disclosed or made available to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives by Owner, or any of Owner\u2019s Representatives, which is either confidential, proprietary, or otherwise not generally available to the public, including, without limitation, analyses, interpretations, compilations, reports, reservoir data, geologic and geophysical data, maps, models, financial data, economic data, commercial data, contractual data, environmental data, marketing data, operational data, engineering data, and other information, documents, materials and data, as well as any copies, notes, reports, analyses, compilations, data, studies, excerpts, evaluation materials, summaries or other documents, information, or materials developed or prepared by or on behalf of the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives that include, incorporate, refer to, reflect, are derived from or are based on, in whole or in part, any other Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not constitute Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement: (a) information that is or becomes generally available to the public\nother than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Company or any of the Receiving Company\u2019s Representatives; (b) information which was already known by the Receiving Company on a non-confidential basis prior to being disclosed or made available to the Receiving Company by Owner or Owner\u2019s Representatives; (c) information which becomes available to the Receiving Company or the Receiving Company\u2019s Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Owner or any of Owner\u2019s Representatives, provided that such source was not subject to any confidentiality obligation or other prohibition against transmitting the information to the Receiving Company or any of the Receiving Company\u2019s Representatives; and (d) information that is independently developed by the Receiving Company or its Representatives without use of, or reference to, the Confidential Information.\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 2(a) or anything to the contrary contained herein on the use or disclosure of Confidential Information in this Agreement, Owner acknowledges that (1) the Receiving Company is involved in widespread oil and gas activities and receives confidential information and data from many different sources; (2) its review of the Confidential Information will not preclude any oil and gas operation or activity by it subsequent to the review hereunder in any area that was subject to the review or any other areas (but only so long as the Confidential Information is not used in connection with such operation or activity in violation of this agreement); (3) the Receiving Company\u2019s Representatives may retain general mental impressions of the Confidential Information; and (4) its Representatives shall not be precluded from working on projects in an area which was subject to review hereunder because of their general mental impressions (but only so long as the Confidential Information is not used in connection with such operation or activity in violation of this agreement).\n3. Required Disclosures. In the event that law, legal process, court order or any governmental or regulatory authority requires the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives to disclose all or any portion of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Company or such Representative may do so; provided that it shall immediately provide written notice to Owner of the required disclosure, unless such notice is prohibited by law, so that Owner may have an opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order. The Receiving Company and its Representatives agree to cooperate with any reasonable request of Owner in its efforts to secure such protective order or other appropriate remedy. If Owner is unable to obtain such protective order or other appropriate remedy, the Receiving Company or its Representatives shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Company or its Representatives are advised in writing by counsel is required by law to be furnished and shall exercise their reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Existence of Negotiations. Without the prior, written consent of Owner, neither the Receiving Company nor its Representatives shall disclose to any other person that it has received the Confidential Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place between Owner and the Receiving Company concerning a possible Transaction, including the status or terms of such discussions or negotiations, or the fact that Receiving Party is evaluating a possible Transaction.\n5. No Representations or Warranties; No License.\n(a) Neither Owner nor any of its Representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty as to (i) the accuracy, quality or completeness of the Information or (ii) the presence, quality or quantity of oil, gas or other hydrocarbons or the expected results of exploration, production or marketing activities. The Receiving Company agrees that neither Owner nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives resulting directly or indirectly from the Receiving Company\u2019s use of the Information. For the purposes of this Section 5(a), \u201cInformation\u201d is deemed to include, without limitation, any and all Confidential Information and other information and data furnished by Owner or any of Owner\u2019s Representatives, whether or not such information is Confidential Information as defined in Section 2.\n(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives under any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of Owner, nor shall this Agreement be construed to grant to the Receiving Company or any of its Representatives any licenses or other rights in or to the Confidential Information except the limited right to review the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of determining whether to enter into the Transaction. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to confer upon the Receiving Company or its Representatives any right whatsoever to any interest Owner has or may have in the Properties.\n6. Return of Information. The Confidential Information shall remain the property of Owner, and the written Confidential Information, except for that portion of the Confidential Information that is contained in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Receiving Company in connection with the Transaction, shall be destroyed or returned to Owner immediately upon its request, and no copies shall be retained by the Receiving Company or its Representatives, unless the Parties agree otherwise; provided, however, that any Confidential Information contained in back-up computer records may be retained for such period required for compliance purposes if required by law, rule or regulation; provided further, that such Confidential Information shall continue to be subject to the confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use obligations contained in this Agreement until returned in accordance with this Section 6. That portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Receiving Company or its Representatives, oral or visual Confidential Information, and written Confidential Information not so returned shall be destroyed (such destruction to be certified promptly in writing to Owner by an authorized officer of the Receiving Company).\n7. No Waiver. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n8. Equitable Relief. The Receiving Company acknowledges and agrees that Owner may be irreparably injured, such that money damages alone may not be adequate remedy, and will be entitled to equitable relief (including, without limitation, the granting of specific performance and injunctive relief in Owner\u2019s favor), if the Receiving Company or any person to whom the Receiving Company discloses any Confidential Information breaches or threatens to breach the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Company agrees that equitable relief is not exclusive of other remedies to which Owner may be entitled at law or in equity. The Receiving Company further agrees to waive, and cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for securing or posting any bond in connection with the pursuit of any such remedy.\n9. No Obligation to Consummate Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any manner obligate either Party to proceed with the Transaction, whether on the terms suggested by the Receiving Company, or on any other terms. The Receiving Company acknowledges and agrees that Owner, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) is free to explore other potential opportunities that may lead to a possible Transaction with another party with respect to the Properties, (b) may change the procedures relating to its consideration of a Transaction involving the Properties at any time without prior notice, (c) may reject any and all proposals made by the Receiving Company with respect to a possible Transaction, (d) may terminate discussions with the Receiving Company at any time and for any reason, and (e) will have no obligation or liability to the Receiving Company with regard to a possible Transaction or any negotiations relating to a possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, unless and until, and only in the event that, a definitive agreement has been executed by the Parties with respect to the Transaction. Accordingly, Owner may elect at any time to terminate further access to and review of the Confidential Information, at which time the obligations of the Receiving Company contained in Section 6 above shall be applicable. The Receiving Company\u2019s obligation to maintain the Confidential Information confidential as provided in this Agreement shall survive any decision by Owner not to proceed with the Transaction, or to proceed with a party other than the Receiving Company.\n10. Access to Employees. The Receiving Company agrees that, unless otherwise instructed by Owner, all communications with Owner regarding the proposed Transaction, including requests for additional information from Owner in connection with the Transaction, requests for facility tours or management meetings with Owner in connection with the Transaction and discussions with or questions for Owner regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed only to BMO Capital Markets Corp. and not to Owner or any of its other Representatives.\n11. No Solicitation. Until the expiration of one year from the Effective Date, or until the execution of a definitive agreement between the Parties regarding a Transaction that addresses solicitation of employees, whichever is earlier, the Receiving Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, (a) directly or indirectly recruit (including as a director or consultant), solicit (including by contracting through an independent contractor, consultant or other third party) or otherwise induce any director, officer, employee or consultant of Owner or its Affiliates to terminate his or her directorship, employment or consultancy, as the case may be, or (b) hire or assist another person or entity in hiring or engaging as a consultant any officer, employee or consultant of Owner or its Affiliates. The Receiving Company is not restricted from hiring officers or employees of Owner or its Affiliates who respond to public advertisements for job openings.\n12. No Joint Venture. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not create a partnership, joint venture, or any other business combination between the Parties.\n13. Notices. Any communications between the Parties or notices or requests in connection with this Agreement may be given by mailing the same, postage prepaid, or sending the same by electronic mail (\u201cemail\u201d) transmission (provided that receipt of such email is requested and received, excluding automatic receipts) to each Party at its address shown below, or to such other addresses as either Party may in writing hereafter indicate. Notices shall be effective only when received.\nIf to Owner:\nQEP Energy Company\n1050 17th Street, Suite 800\nDenver, Colorado 80265\nAttention: Chris Woosley, Senior Vice President and General Counsel\nEmail: Chris.Woosley@qepres.com\nIf to the Receiving Company:\n_______________________\n_______________________\n_______________________\nAttention:\nEmail:\n14. Term. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter for a period of one year, whereupon this Agreement shall automatically terminate, unless otherwise terminated by the mutual written agreement of the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 6 will survive termination of this Agreement until such time as Receiving Party and its Representatives have destroyed all Confidential Information retained in accordance with Section 6, and the remaining Sections of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement until such time and to the extent necessary to enforce or give full force and effect the obligations set forth in Section 6.\n15. Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement (a) represents the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to the matters contained herein; and, (b) may be amended, modified or waived in whole or in part only by a separate writing executed by the Parties, which writing expressly amends, modifies or waives all or part of this Agreement. The headings of the sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not constitute a part hereof or affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n16. Severability. The invalidity of any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and in case of any such invalidity, this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid provision had not been included herein.\n17. Assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Owner and its successors and assigns and shall be binding on the Receiving Company, its Representatives and its and their successors and assigns; provided that the Receiving Company may not assign any right or obligation hereunder to any person without the prior written consent of Owner, which such consent may be withheld in Owner\u2019s sole and absolute discretion. Any attempted assignment by the Receiving Company without such required consent shall be null and void ab initio.\n18. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, excluding any choice of law rules that may direct application of laws of another jurisdiction. Owner and the Receiving Company agree that the exclusive venue and forum for any action brought in connection with this Agreement will be initiated and maintained in any state or federal court located in Harris County, Texas and irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury and any right such Party may have to object to such venue and forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Owner shall be entitled to seek emergency or temporary injunctive or other equitable relief or to seek the enforcement of any judgment in its favor in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.\n19. Expenses. In the event of litigation or other formal legal or regulatory proceedings to clarify a matter, resolve a dispute or remedy a breach hereunder, the prevailing Party under a final and non-appealable court, tribunal or agency order or mandate shall be fully reimbursed by the other Party for all reasonable costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by the prevailing Party in any such proceeding.\n20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute a single agreement. This Agreement may be validly executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission.\n[Signature page follows.]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the duly authorized representatives of Owner and the Receiving Company have executed this Agreement effective as of the Effective Date.\nOWNER: RECEIVING COMPANY:\nQEP ENERGY COMPANY [______________________]\n_____________________________________

Definition of Confidentiality. As used in this Agreement, \""Confidential Information\"" refers to any information which entails personal details of fellow members, supporters, associates such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and other contact details as well as operational manuals, methods, computer software, works of art, drafts and designs, financial data, places of meetings, secrets and other proprietary information related to the past, current, future and proposed activities of the Society, and any other information which is privileged, proprietary and confidential.\n2. Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations. Recipient will maintain in confidence and will not disclose, disseminate or use any Confidential Information belonging to and/or related to Society, whether or not in written form. Recipient agrees that Recipient shall treat all Confidential Information of the Society with at least the same degree of care as Recipient accords its own confidential information. Recipient further represents that Recipient exercises at least reasonable care to protect its own confidential information.\n3. Survival. This Agreement shall govern all communications between the parties. Recipient understands that its obligations under Paragraph 2 (\""Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations\"") shall survive the termination of any other relationship between the parties.

Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and by the laws of the State of Victoria; as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Australia.\n5. Injunctive Relief. A breach of any of the promises or agreements contained herein will result in irreparable and continuing damage to the Society for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and the Society shall be entitled to injunctive relief and/or a decree for specific performance, and such other relief as may be proper (including monetary damages if appropriate).\n6. Entire Agreement.

"      Attachment F\nConfidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement\nfor\nThe State Bar of California\nIn connection with the RFP for a Telephony Refresh Project (\u201cRFP\u201d) the State Bar of California (\u201cState Bar\u201d) will provide __________________________________ (\u201cCompany\u201d) access to confidential information under the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cNDA\u201d).\nConfidential information (\u201cInformation\u201d) means and includes, but is not limited to, the additional confidential and proprietary intellectual property regarding existing installations that is provided by the State Bar after submission of this agreement. All Information disclosed by the State Bar is and at all times will remain the sole and exclusive property of the State Bar. Without the State Bar\u2019s prior written consent, Company will not: (i) disclose to any person or entity the substance or import of the Information; (ii) use any Information to access or obtain additional information outside the purpose contemplated by this NDA; (iii) duplicate, distribute or otherwise reproduce any Information in any way.\nCompany agrees that it will retain all Information provided in connection with the RFP in the strictest confidence, and will neither use nor disclose such Information to anyone other than those who, in each case, need to know the Information for the purpose of responding to this RFP.

(the \u201cParties\u201d) have an interest in participating in discussions wherein either Party might share information with the other that the disclosing Party considers to be proprietary and confidential to itself (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d); and\nWHEREAS the Parties agree that Confidential Information of a Party might include, but not be limited to that Party\u2019s: (1) business plans, methods, and practices; (2) personnel, customers, and suppliers; (3) inventions, processes, methods, products, patent applications, and other proprietary rights; or (4) specifications, drawings, sketches, models, samples, tools, computer programs, technical information, or other related information;\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Either Party may disclose Confidential Information to the other Party in confidence provided that the disclosing Party identifies such information as proprietary and confidential either by marking it, in the case of written materials, or, in the case of information that is disclosed orally or written materials that are not marked, by notifying the other Party of the proprietary and confidential nature of the information, such notification to be done orally, by e-mail or written correspondence, or via other means of communication as might be appropriate.\n2. When informed of the proprietary and confidential nature of Confidential Information that has been disclosed by the other Party, the receiving Party (\u201cRecipient\u201d) shall, for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure, refrain from disclosing such Confidential Information to any contractor or other third party without prior, written approval from the disclosing Party and shall protect such Confidential Information from inadvertent disclosure to a third party using the same care and diligence that the Recipient uses to protect its own proprietary and confidential information, but in no case less than reasonable care. The Recipient shall ensure that each of its employees, officers, directors, or agents who has access to Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement is informed of its proprietary and confidential nature and is required to abide by the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient of Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall promptly notify the disclosing Party of any disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement or of any subpoena or other legal process requiring production or disclosure of said Confidential Information.\n3. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall be and remain the property of the disclosing Party and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights to such Confidential Information on the other Party. The Recipient shall honor any request from the disclosing Party to promptly return or destroy all copies of Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement and all notes related to such Confidential Information. The Parties agree that the disclosing Party will suffer irreparable injury if its Confidential Information is made public, released to a third party, or otherwise disclosed in breach of this Agreement and that the disclosing Party shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against a threatened breach or continuation of any such breach and, in the event of such breach, an award of actual and exemplary damages from any court of competent jurisdiction.\n4. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party\u2019s right to develop independently or acquire products without use of the other Party\u2019s Confidential Information. The disclosing party acknowledges that the Recipient may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties, that is similar to the Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Recipient from developing or having developed for it products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Confidential Information provided that the Recipient does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.\n5. Notwithstanding the above, the Parties agree that information shall not be deemed Confidential Information and the Recipient shall have no obligation to hold in confidence such information, where such information:\n(a) Is already known to the Recipient, having been disclosed to the Recipient by a third party without such third party having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or\n(b) Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Recipient, its employees, officers, directors, or agents; or\n(c) Is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder; or\n(d) Is approved for release (and only to the extent so approved) by the disclosing Party; or\n(e) Is disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement of a court or governmental agency or where required by operation of law.\n6. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to constitute an agency, partnership, joint venture, or other similar relationship between the Parties.\n7. Neither Party will, without prior approval of the other Party, make any public announcement of or otherwise disclose the existence or the terms of this Agreement.\n8. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties and in no way creates an obligation for either Party to disclose information to the other Party or to enter into any other agreement.\n9. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of two (2) years from the Effective Date unless otherwise terminated by either Party giving notice to the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement. The requirement to protect Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF:\nROUNDHOUSE CREATIVE P/L Business

Confidential Information. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all information, regardless of the form in which it is communicated or maintained (whether oral, written, electronic or visual) and whether prepared by Company or otherwise, which is disclosed to Counterparty, regardless of whether such information is disclosed intentionally or inadvertently, before or after the execution of this Agreement, in connection with the Transaction and including all records, reports, analyses, notes, memoranda, documentation, knowledge, data, specifications, diagrams, statistics, systems or software, manuals, business plans, operational information or practices, processes (whether or not patented, patentable or reduced to practice), customer lists, concepts, ideas, policies, contractual arrangements with, and information about, the Company\u2019s suppliers, distributors and customers, the existence of the discussions between the Parties concerning the Transaction, or other information that are based on, contain or reflect any such Confidential Information.

Nondisclosure and Use of Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not be used for any purpose other than to analyze, implement or complete the Transactions.

Receiving Party shall require all recipients of the Confidential Information to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Agents.

Required Disclosure. In the event that Receiving Party is requested or required by legal or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party of such request or requirement prior to disclosure, if permitted by law, so that Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order. In the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, Receiving Party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that it reasonably determines, in consultation with its counsel, is consistent with the scope of the subpoena or demand, and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. Receiving Party will provide reasonable cooperation to Disclosing Party and its legal counsel with respect to performance of the covenants undertaken pursuant to this Section 3.\n4. Remedies. The Receiving Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to remedy or prevent any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Such remedy shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the Receiving Party\u2019s liability to the Disclosing Party in connection with this Agreement and any activities undertaken in connection with the evaluation of the Transactions shall be limited to direct damages and shall exclude any other liability, including without limitation liability for special, indirect, punitive or consequential damages in contract, tort, warranty, strict liability or otherwise.\n5.

At any time after which the Receiving Party has been required to return or destroy the Confidential Information in its possession in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Receiving Party shall, upon written request of the Disclosing Party, cause one of its duly authorized officers to certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that the requirements of the preceding sentence have been satisfied in full. The Receiving Party shall not be deemed to have retained or failed to destroy any Confidential Information which is an Imaged Document if such Confidential Information is deleted from local hard drives so long as no attempt is made to recover such Confidential Information from servers or back-up sources, provided that any such retained Confidential Information in an Imaged Document form shall remain subject to the disclosure and use restrictions set forth herein, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.\n6. Notice. Any notice given to a Party shall be deemed properly given if specifically acknowledged by the other Party in writing or when delivered by certified or registered mail to the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement.

To avoid any potential abuse of the information obtained, the Receiving Party hereby gives SINTEC an irrevocable undertaking as follows; and SINTEC hereby accepts said undertaking:\n1. Definition\nInformation within the meaning of this Agreement shall include any and all technical and commercial information, specifically drawings, plans, specifications, methods, formulae, de-signs, documentation, calculations, market and customer data as well as materials and other objects which are disclosed by SINTEC directly or indirectly in connection with initiating or con-ducting the business relationship described in the Preamble, be it in oral, visual, or written form or via data storage media or in any other way, shape or form.\n2. Duty of confidentiality\nThe Receiving Party shall treat as strictly confidential any and all information disclosed to it by SINTEC and shall not disclose said information to third parties or use it for its own business purposes or for other customers without the prior written consent of SINTEC. The Receiving Par-ty shall use the information only for SINTEC's specified or authorized purposes in each case.\n3. Disclosure of information to employees\nThe Receiving Party will disclose information it receives from SINTEC only to selected members of its staff and only to the extent absolutely necessary for SINTEC's specified or authorized purposes in each case. To the extent permitted by law, the Receiving Party shall ensure that said employees are bound to a duty of confidentiality for the term of their respective employment relationship in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and that such duty of confidentiality shall survive the termination/expiration of the respective employment relationship.\n4. Exceptions to the duty of confidentiality\nThe duty of confidentiality shall not apply if and to the extent the Receiving Party can show that the relevant information was already in the public domain at the time it was disclosed by SINTEC; that it entered the public domain after SINTEC had disclosed it through no fault of the Receiving Party; or that after having been disclosed to the Receiving Party it was lawfully published by third parties without any restrictions regarding confidentiality or use.\nThe burden of proof for the application of any of the aforementioned exceptions shall lie with the Receiving Party to the extent it invokes them.\n5. Proprietary information, reproductions\n5.1 All information disclosed by SINTEC shall remain the property of SINTEC. The Receiving Party shall return information provided to it any time upon request and, at SINTEC's option, promptly return it to SINTEC once and for all at no charge, or destroy it without retaining any copies or records thereof.\n5.2 No reproductions may be made of the information disclosed by SINTEC.

Term and validity period\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement shall apply for a period of three (3) years from the date on which it is signed by both Parties; thereafter it will renew for a term of two (2) years, unless terminated in writing by one of the Parties eighteen (18) months prior to the respective expiration date. The duties of confidentiality hereunder shall survive the termination/expiration of this Non-Disclosure Agreement for a period of three (3) years.\n7.

Patentable findings\nShould new, patentable findings be made directly or indirectly in connection with the disclosure of information described in the Preamble, SINTEC shall have the sole and exclusive right to apply for patent protection of such findings and to commercially exploit them.\nThe Receiving Party hereby waives the assertion of any rights based on prior use against pa-tents filed for such findings. By the same token, SINTEC undertakes that it will not assert its pa-tent rights arising under any such patent applications against the Receiving Party, provided the Receiving Party uses them outside the following fields of technology: paint and plant systems, automotive, automobile and aircraft production, energy and environmental systems, wood processing. The terms of this section shall survive the term of this Agreement.\n9.

Severability\nShould any provision of this Agreement be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions thereof.

Writing requirement\nAny amendments or supplements to this Agreement must be executed in writing.\n13. Miscellaneous\nThe Parties shall stipulate the nature and scope of any potential cooperation by separate agreement.

Use of Confidential Information. The Parties agree that they will not use or disclose (and they will cause their respective employees, agents, affiliates, representatives and consultants not to use or disclose) in any form or for any reason any of the Confidential Information for any purpose that is not directly related to the Purpose described above. The Party receiving Confidential Information (\u201cRecipient\u201d) shall make use of the Confidential Information only for the Purpose and, except as provided below, shall not provide the Confidential Information to any other person without the express written consent of the party disclosing the Confidential Information (\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d). Recipient will notify each employee, agent, affiliate, representative, or consultant involved in the business discussions or who may have any occasion to view, handle, or obtain any of the Confidential Information, of the terms of this Agreement and shall require such person to enter into an agreement with terms similar to this Agreement. The Parties further agree that such Confidential Information will only be provided by Recipient to those of its directors, officers, elected or appointed officials, employees, agents, affiliates, advisors, representatives, or consultants with a need to know.\nThe Parties acknowledge that Anaheim is a public entity subject to the California Public Records Act, and the Ralph M.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Recipient receives a request for Confidential Information, Recipient shall give Disclosing Party prompt written notice at the address designated herein prior to any disclosure in sufficient time to allow Disclosing Party, at its sole cost and expense, to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy concerning such disclosure. Recipient will disclose only such information as it determines is legally required and will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information that is so disclosed. Recipient is not required to seek or obtain a judicial determination establishing confidential treatment, but it will cooperated in any efforts to do so by Disclosing Party.

Standard of Care. Recipient shall protect the disclosed Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination, or publication of the Confidential Information as Recipient uses to protect its own Confidential Information.\n4. Identification. Recipient\u2019s obligation shall only extend to Confidential Information that: (a) is marked as confidential at the time of disclosure; or (b) is unmarked (e.g. orally disclosed) but treated as Confidential Information at the time of disclosure.\n5. Exclusions. This Agreement imposes no obligation upon Recipient with respect to information that: (a) was rightfully in Recipient\u2019s possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party; (b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; (c) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (d) is disclosed by Disclosing Party to a third party without duty of confidentiality on the third party; (e) is independently developed by Recipient; (f) is disclosed under operation of law; or (g) is disclosed by Recipient with Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written approval.\n6. Rights.

The Disclosing Party is an [advisor to a potential buyer] who is willing to, either itself or through its Affiliate(s) (as defined below), acquire, directly or indirectly, shares in the Target (as defined below) or assets owned by the Target (the \u201cTransaction\u201d).\nII. In view of the proposed Transaction, the Disclosing Party has agreed to disclose to the Receiving Party certain Confidential Information (as defined below), and the Receiving Party has agreed to maintain secrecy in relation to such Confidential Information.\nIT IS AGREED:\nDefinitions:\nUnless otherwise defined in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\nAffiliate of the Party and/or any person specified in this Agreement, means:\n(i) its parent company, its founder (participant or shareholder), including a physical person; and/or\n(ii) any company directly or indirectly controlled by the Party and/or its parent company.\nConfidential Information means any information and documents (whether or not designated as confidential), including, without limitation, financial, tax, commercial, corporate, legal, technical, operational, management, business and other information and documents concerning the Target or any of their Affiliates, as well as any and all information and documents regarding the intended sale of the Target, that is directly or indirectly disclosed, furnished or made available, whether before or after the date hereof, in any way or by any means whatsoever (including, without limitation, in writing, orally or in electronic form), in a data room or elsewhere, to the Receiving Party or any employees of the Receiving Party, by any director, manager, agent, representative, advisor or employee of the Disclosing Party or any Affiliate of the Disclosing Party, in connection with the intended sale of the Target. Confidential Information may include, without limitation, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, technical data or specifications, testing methods, Target or financial information, research and development activities, product and marketing plans, and customer and supplier information. For the sake of clarity, the fact that the Seller is considering selling the Target, and the existence and contents of this Agreement, are deemed to be Confidential Information.\nTarget include: [Name of the company], a company duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of [\u25cf] whose registered office is at: [\u25cf], registered under No. [\u25cf].\n1. The subject of this Agreement is to secure the confidentiality of information determined hereunder as Confidential Information.\n2. The Receiving Party undertakes to use Confidential Information only in direct connection with the Transaction.\n3. The Receiving Party undertakes not to disclose Confidential Information to other persons, except the employees of the Receiving Party listed in Annex 1 to this Agreement that need to possess such information in order to achieve the purposes specified in Section 2 of this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise obliged to maintain confidentiality in relation to the Confidential Information to the extent specified in this Agreement. The Receiving Party undertakes to keep Confidential Information separate from other information that belongs to the Receiving Party and/or third parties. The Receiving Party undertakes to take all possible measures that are necessary to prevent and avoid disclosure and/or loss of any Confidential Information. In any case, such measures should comply with the measures that the Receiving Party would take for proper handling and protection of its own confidential information, and thus it must be the safety level that is not less than may reasonably be necessary. In the case of unauthorised disclosure and/or loss of Confidential Information, the Receiving Party must immediately inform the Receiving Party.\n4. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the information defined hereunder as Confidential Information is a commercial secret of the Disclosing Party, as it has commercial value in view of it being unknown and not publicly accessible.\n5. The obligations of the Receiving Party with respect to the preservation and nondisclosure of the Confidential Information under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect without being limited in time, except for cases when the Disclosing Party provides its written consent as to any reduction of said term.\n6. This Agreement shall enter into effect upon its execution and shall remain effective for three (3) years, except for the obligations of the Receiving Party as to preservation and nondisclosure of the Confidential Information set forth in Section 5 hereof above which remain in force after termination (or expiration) of this Agreement.\n7. No rights or obligations other than those expressly provided for in this Agreement shall be implied under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall in any way affect the present and/or future rights of the Parties under the law on intellectual property rights of any country, or be construed to grant to the Receiving Party a license (permit) for usage of any present or future object of intellectual property related to the Confidential information of the Disclosing Party.\n8. This Agreement shall be binding for both Parties. This Agreement is executed in favor of the Parties and their respective successors. Neither Party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement to other persons except with the prior written consent of the other Party.\n9. Provisions of this Agreement do not refer to the Confidential Information which:\n\u2022 at the time of disclosure (or transfer/announcement) to the Receiving Party, was or became generally known or published without the Receiving Party's breach of this Agreement, provided that the Receiving Party may specify the source of such publicly known information;\n\u2022 at the time of disclosure (or transfer/announcement) under this Agreement, was already known to the Receiving Party and was not received by the Receiving Party under the terms of confidentiality, provided that the Receiving Party can prove the same; and\n\u2022 was received by the Receiving Party lawfully from a third party after its disclosure (transfer, announcement) by the Disclosing Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, provided that the Receiving Party can prove the same.\n10. If disclosure (transfer, announcement) of Confidential Information is required from the Receiving Party and/or its representatives by a court or another governmental body, the Receiving Party shall promptly, but in any event before the disclosure (or transfer/announcement) of the Confidential Information, notify the Disclosing Party in writing and provide the Disclosing Party with the opportunity to take appropriate measures to protect and preserve confidentiality of such information. If such a request (or demand) from a court or another governmental body to disclose (or transfer/announce) Confidential Information has not been revoked (or invalidated) before the moment the relevant information is to be provided, the Receiving Party has the right to disclose (or transfer) only the part of the Confidential Information that it is obliged to disclose (or transfer) under the laws of Ukraine\n11. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party undertakes to promptly return to the Disclosing Party, or, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s discretion, destroy all the Confidential Information (together with all copies and extracts) stored by the Receiving Party and/or its representatives (including without limitation, on computer disks and/or other digital media). Within five (5) calendar days from the date of termination (expiration) of this Agreement, unless there was a written request from the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall destroy all Confidential Information (together with all copies and extracts) stored by the Receiving Party and/or its representatives (including without limitation, on computer disks and/or other digital media). In case of destruction of Confidential Information under the terms of this Section, the Receiving Party shall send to the Disclosing Party a written confirmation of such destruction, which should contain a list of the destroyed Confidential Information.\n12. All disputes which may arise from or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled through negotiations between the Parties. If such a dispute between the Parties cannot be settled through negotiations between the Parties, either Party may submit such a dispute to a court in accordance with [specify the jurisdiction] laws.\n13. In case the Receiving Party breaches this Agreement, the Disclosing Party, the Target or any of their Affiliates are entitled to receive from the Receiving Party compensation of financial and moral damages, suffered by the Disclosing Party, the Target or any of their Affiliates respectively, as a result of such breach by the Receiving Party.\n14. This Agreement contains the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the Parties as to regulation of relations pertaining to the subject of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior and existing arrangements and agreements relating to the subject of this Agreement. The invalidity of one of the provisions of the Agreement does not entail the invalidity of the entire Agreement.\n15. This Agreement and all legal relations arising from it shall be governed by the laws of [specify the jurisdiction].\n16. All notices and documents sent by the Parties to each other under this Agreement shall be made in writing, sealed (if applicable) by the respective Party and delivered either by (i) courier and/or a representative of the Party concerned (in this case they are deemed received from the moment the representative of the Party to which such notice/document was sent, confirms receipt of the notification/document with his signature, indicating the date and time of receipt), or (ii) insured letter by mail to the post address of the Party concerned, as indicated at the end of this Agreement (in this case, such letters are considered to be received after three (3) calendar days from the date of posting).\n17. This Agreement is made in two identical copies in the English language with both having equal legal force and comes into effect once signed by the authorised representatives of the Parties and sealed by the Parties.\nDisclosing Party\n[Name of the Company]\n[Registration/identification number]\n[Address of registered office]\n[Bank account details]\n____________________\nReceiving Party\n[Name of

Confidential Information shall be used solely for the Purpose, and the Parties agree that it shall only disclose Confidential Information to those employees and consultants who have a need to know such Confidential Information in furtherance of the Purpose. Prior to providing the Confidential Information to any employee or consultant, the receiving Party shall ensure that an executed nondisclosure agreement is in place with each employee or consultant with protections that are substantially similar to the protections in this Agreement. Prior to providing any Confidential Information to employees or consultants, the receiving Party shall notify such persons that such information is Confidential Information and must be kept in confidence as set forth in this Agreement. The receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this agreement by such Party's employees and consultants. NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS MADE OR GIVEN UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AS TO THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR CURRENT NATURE OF ANY OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DISCLOSED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR ITS USEFULNESS OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE FOR, OR USE WITH, OR IN RELATION TO THE PURPOSE.\n3. The obligations of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not apply to any information that: (a) was previously known to the Parties free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (b) is or has become publicly known, through no wrongful act of either Party; (c) was rightfully received from a third party who is under no obligation of confidence to the receiving Party; (d) was independently developed by the Parties without use of Confidential Information that has been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement; or (e) was required to be disclosed in order to comply with applicable law or regulation (including without limitation for securities law purposes) or with any requirement imposed by any governmental or court order but only to the extent required. Prior to making any disclosure under subsection (e) above, the receiving Party shall: (i) immediately notify the disclosing Party of the required disclosure upon receipt of a governmental or court order; and (ii) cooperate with the disclosing Party in making, if available under applicable law, a good faith effort to obtain a protective order or other appropriate determination against or limiting disclosure or use of the Confidential Information, at no cost to the Parties.\n4. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of the disclosing Party. The disclosure of Confidential Information by the disclosing Party shall not constitute an express or implied grant to the receiving Party, of any rights to or under the disclosing Party\u2019s patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks or any other intellectual property rights. Upon the disclosing Party\u2019s request, at the completion of the Purpose, all Confidential Information shall be either returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed and certified in writing that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the receiving Party will continue to be bound by its confidentiality and other obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n5. Neither Party shall in any way or in any form distribute, disclose, publicize, issue press releases, or advertise in any manner, including, but not limited to, making representations in court pleadings (except as required under law), the discussions that gave rise to this Agreement or the discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement or the information provided pursuant to this Agreement, or that any conversations or discussions are occurring or have occurred between the Parties, nor shall either Party use the other Party\u2019s trademarks, trade names or other proprietary marks in any manner, without first obtaining the prior written consent of such Party.\n6. This Agreement shall continue for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date or until such time as a definitive agreement(s) is entered into by the Parties with respect to the Purpose provided however that the obligations contained in this Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years from the date of termination of this Agreement.\n7. This Agreement shall be governed by and constituted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of North Carolina, and shall be binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and worldwide. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other term hereof. The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in North Carolina. Each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to a trial by jury in connection with any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.\n8. The Parties acknowledge that remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the disclosing Party against any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party or by its representatives and, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the disclosing Party, the Parties agree to allow the seeking of injunctive or other equitable relief in the disclosing Party\u2019s favor, without the requirement of providing proof of actual damages.\n9. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties related to the disclosure of Confidential Information with respect to the Purpose. This Agreement may only be modified in a writing executed by both Parties. Should any provision of this Agreement be deemed illegal or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n10. This Agreement shall not create, nor will it create an obligation to form a joint venture, partnership or other formal business relationship of any kind nor will it prohibit either Party from engaging in similar discussions, relationships, or transactions with a similar Purpose, with any other third party.\n11. Neither this Agreement, nor any rights hereunder, in whole or in part, shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by either Party.\n12. If a legal action between the Parties arises from this Agreement or the conduct of any Party with respect to any Confidential Information, the prevailing Party shall recover from the other Party its reasonable attorney fees and costs. No waiver of any right under, or breach of, this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced.\n13. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile and in counterparts.\n14. Other than this Agreement, no contract or agreement providing for any relationship involving the Parties (whether relating to the Purpose or otherwise) will be deemed to exist between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement(s) has been executed and delivered by each of the Parties, and unless and until any such definitive agreement(s) has been executed an delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind or nature whatsoever, except for the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement\nIN WITNESS HEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the date and year written above.\nINDIVIDUAL COMPANY\nBy: By:\nPrint Name: Print Name:\nDate: ________________ Date:

"      CONFIDENTIAL\nMUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this \""Agreement\"") is entered into as of September 11, 2013 by and between Sony Pictures Television Inc., having a place of business at 10202 West Washington Boulevard, Culver City, California 90232 (\""Sony Pictures\""), and Tribune Company, having its principal place of business at 435 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611 (\""Company\"").\nWHEREAS, Sony Pictures and Company wish to have discussions regarding potential business opportunities, including the possibility of Sony Pictures producing programming for Company affiliated stations and acquiring equity in Company (the \""Potential Transaction\""); and accordingly wish to disclose to and receive from each other, from time to time during the term of this Agreement, certain confidential and proprietary information regarding their respective businesses;\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of such disclosures and the agreements and covenants herein contained, each of Sony Pictures and Company agrees as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all information disclosed, directly or indirectly, through any means of communication or observation, by or on behalf of one party hereto (the \""Disclosing Party\"") to the other party hereto (the \""Receiving Party\"") on or after the date hereof, that relates to or is derived from the Disclosing Party\u2019s business, strategic, marketing, technological or creative affairs, or to any other matter that the Receiving Party is advised or has reason to know is the confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing Party. Any material provided by either party to the other which is clearly designated \""Confidential\"" (or other similar legend) will be presumed to be Confidential Information; the absence of any such legend, however, will not preclude the same from being deemed Confidential Information.\n2. Exceptions to Confidential Information. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, \""Confidential Information\"" does not include information which:\n(a) is or becomes generally known or available to the public through no act or failure to act by the Receiving Party or its Representatives (as defined below) in breach of this Agreement;\n(b) is or becomes known to the Receiving Party from a third party who, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party after reasonable investigation, owes no legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; or\n(c) is or was developed independently by or for the Receiving Party, without use of or reference to any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and without violation of any obligation contained herein.\n3. Protection of Confidential Information. Each party, as a Receiving Party, agrees that it will:\n(a) not use, or authorize the use of, such Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the evaluation, negotiation and, if applicable, consummation of the Potential Transaction;\n(b) other than as permitted by Section 4 of this Agreement, hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and protect such Confidential Information with the same degree of care (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care) such party normally uses to protect its own information that is similar in type or nature to the Confidential Information;\n(c) not disclose such Confidential Information to any person other than to those of its and/or its affiliated companies\u2019 respective employees, stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers, advisors, agents, accountants, attorneys, representatives and/or consultants (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), in each case, who (i) need to know such Confidential Information to facilitate the evaluation, negotiation and, if applicable, consummation of the Potential Transaction, and (ii) are advised of the confidential and proprietary nature of such Confidential Information and are bound by confidentiality obligations (which may be contained in such Representatives\u2019 engagement agreements) that limit the further use and disclosure of such Confidential Information;\n(d) not copy or reproduce all or any part of such Confidential Information in any medium, except as may be strictly necessary to facilitate the use of Confidential Information as permitted by this Agreement; and\n(e) not decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer all or any part of such Confidential Information.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any use of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information by any Representative of the Receiving Party must be in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting any obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breaches of this Agreement by its Representatives.\n4. Disclosure Compelled by Law or Judicial Proceeding. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose any portion of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party (i) by operation of law or in connection with a judicial or governmental proceeding or arbitration (whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), (ii) pursuant to the rules or regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (or any other applicable securities regulatory body) or (iii) pursuant to the rules or regulations of any securities exchange on which the Receiving Party\u2019s or its parent company\u2019s securities are listed or similar self-regulatory body, then such disclosure will be permissible only if and after the Receiving Party promptly notifies the Disclosing Party of such requirement (to the extent legally permitted) so that the Disclosing Party (at its sole cost and expense) may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In no event will the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives oppose any action by the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or assurance of confidential treatment to preserve the confidentiality of any such Confidential Information. If as a result of any such requirement the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information or the existence, content or status of negotiations relating to the specific transactions contemplated by the Potential Transaction, the Receiving Party may furnish, without liability hereunder, that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which it is required to disclose.\n5. Ownership of Confidential Information. All rights in, and title to, the Confidential Information supplied by a Disclosing Party remain in such Disclosing Party. Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure of any Confidential Information will be construed as granting to the Receiving Party (either expressly, by implication or estoppel, or otherwise) any license or immunity under any copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, or other intellectual property right now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party, or any right to use, exploit or further develop the same, except solely to effectuate the evaluation of the Potential Transaction.\n6. No Further Obligations; No Violation; Export Controls. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create, any obligation to enter into any other agreement with respect to the Confidential Information or the Potential Transaction. Neither party shall be under any obligation hereunder to continue any discussions or negotiations regarding the Potential Transaction and either party may terminate such discussions or negotiations at any time without liability hereunder. Moreover, unless and until a definitive written agreement is entered into, neither party nor any of either party's Representatives shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction except for the matters specifically set forth in this Agreement. Additionally, this Agreement does not constitute or create any obligation of either party to provide any Confidential Information or other information to the other party, rather it merely defines the duties and obligations of each party and its Representatives with respect to the Confidential Information to the extent Confidential Information may be disclosed or made available. Under no circumstances is either party obligated to disclose or make available any information to the other party, including any Confidential Information, which in its sole and absolute discretion it determines not to disclose. Each party acknowledges and understands that the other party does not need or desire to receive any Confidential Information that is government classified information, or is otherwise restricted information, the receipt, disclosure, use or retention of which is made a crime by any provision of applicable statute or the rules and regulations thereunder. The parties accordingly agree that such information will not be provided, either orally, in writing or otherwise. Neither party will transmit nor export, directly or indirectly, any technical data received from the other party, or any product utilizing any such data, in violation of applicable data export laws and regulations.\n7. Competitive Activities. Each party understands that either party may have, or in the future may enter into, relationships with third parties having pre-existing relationships with the other party. Provided that each party complies with its obligations contained herein, and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not in any way limit, restrict or preclude either party from pursuing any of its present or future business activities or interests or from entering into any agreement or transaction with any person, regardless of whether such business activities or interests are competitive with the business activities and interests of the other party and regardless of whether the subject matter of any such agreement or transaction is in any way similar to or different from the transactions considered and evaluated by the parties.\n8. Concurrent/Future Development. Each Disclosing Party understands and agrees that (x) the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives is currently or may become engaged in lines of business the same as or similar to those of the Disclosing Party and that, wholly independent of the information provided hereunder, the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives may currently or in the future be developing internally, or receiving from third parties, information that coincidentally may be similar to portions of the information provided hereunder and/or otherwise competitive with the Disclosing Party's actual or future projects or business, and (y) wholly independent development by the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives of media content, products, programs, services, goods, concepts, opportunities, documents or information that are coincidentally similar to (but not, in whole or part, based upon) any information provided hereunder will not be deemed to violate this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8 is intended to relieve either party from any of its obligations of confidentiality contained in this Agreement.\n9. Material, Non-public Information. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that the United States securities laws may prohibit any person who has received from an issuer any material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n10. No Warranties. EACH RECEIVING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \""AS IS\"" AND THE DISCLOSING PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\n11. Term / Termination. This Agreement shall commence as of the date first written above and will continue in full force and effect for a period of two (2) years from the date hereof.\n12. Return/Destruction of Documents. In the event that negotiations between the parties are terminated for any reason, and/or upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request, each Receiving Party will forthwith either, at the Receiving Party\u2019s option, return to the Disclosing Party or destroy or erase all Confidential Information furnished by the Disclosing Party as well as all documents, memoranda, analyses, compilations, studies, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives based in whole or in part on the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information. Such return, erasure or destruction shall be certified in writing to the other party by an authorized officer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the parties and their Representatives may each retain Confidential Information to the extent required pursuant to legal or regulatory requirements (including internal compliance procedures instituted to satisfy regulatory obligations), and (ii) because electronic systems may retain information for archival purposes or pursuant to automated computer backup procedures, neither party nor its Representatives shall be required to erase electronically stored Confidential Information that has been saved to a back-up file in accordance with such party or its Representatives\u2019 ordinary electronic back-up practices; provided, that any such information so retained shall be held in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n13. Notices. Notices required to be given by one party to the other in connection with this Agreement will be given in writing and delivered via personal delivery, recognized air courier service (e.g., Federal Express, DHL) or by facsimile with a copy sent by first class, postage paid, return receipt mail to the other party\u2019s address set forth in the introductory paragraph of this Agreement (in the case of notices to Sony Pictures to the attention of: Corporate Legal Department (facsimile number: 310-244-2169), with a copy also to the attention of: Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., 10202 West Washington Boulevard, Culver City, California 90232, Attention: General Counsel (fax number: 310-244-0510) and in the case of notices to the Company to the attention of: Eddie Lazarus, General Counsel (facsimile number: 312-222-4206), or such other address as a party may substitute by giving notice to the other in accordance with this Section.\n14. Communications. Except with the prior permission of the other party, all communications regarding the Potential Transaction and requests for information shall be directed to Eddie Lazarus, in the case of requests regarding the Company, and Chris Mansolillo, in the case of requests regarding Sony Pictures. Each party agrees not to contact any stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the other party, or any customer, supplier or other person having a business relationship with the other party, regarding the Potential Transaction, except with the prior permission of the other party.\n15. Assignment. This Agreement and all rights, duties and obligations hereunder are personal to the undersigned parties and may not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by either party, or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any other attempt by either party to assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation herein is void and without effect and will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement and each and every provision hereof will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.\n16. Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information could cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm and that money damages may be inadequate to compensate the Disclosing Party for such harm. Accordingly, in addition to any other available remedies, the Disclosing Party will, subject to the provisions of Section 19, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and/or specific performance.\n17. Publicity Restrictions. Without the other party\u2019s prior written approval, neither party will (a) make or provide any public or private statement or disclosure to any other person (other than its Representatives) concerning the existence of or any aspect of this Agreement, whether the parties have shared or made available any Confidential Information with each other, or the discussions between the parties, except to the extent such disclosure would be permitted pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement; or (b) use the name, likeness or trademarks of the other party or its Representatives, employees or affiliates to express or imply any relationship or affiliation between the parties, or any endorsement of any product or service. For purposes hereof, the information specified in this Section 17 shall be deemed Confidential Information of each party hereunder.\n18. No Partnership. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create a joint venture, partnership, agency relationship or other business association between the parties.\n19. Applicable Law / Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the choice of law principles thereof. All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof and/or the scope of the provisions of this Section 19 other than actions or proceedings seeking equitable relief (a \u201cProceeding\u201d) shall be submitted to JAMS (\""JAMS\"") for binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less (as applicable, the \u201cRules\u201d) to be held solely in Los Angeles County, California, U.S.A., in the English language in accordance with the provisions below.\n(a) Each arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitral tribunal (the \u201cArbitral Board\u201d) consisting of a single arbitrator who shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge with at least ten (10) years experience in commercial matters. The parties shall be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with Section 1283.05 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, provided that (a) the Arbitral Board must authorize all such discovery in advance based on findings that the material sought is relevant to the issues in dispute and that the nature and scope of such discovery is reasonable under the circumstances, and (b) discovery shall be limited to depositions and production of documents unless the Arbitral Board finds that another method of discovery (e.g., interrogatories) is the most reasonable and cost efficient method of obtaining the information sought.\n(b) There shall be a record of the proceedings at the arbitration hearing and the Arbitral Board shall issue a Statement of Decision setting forth the factual and legal basis for the Arbitral Board's decision. If neither party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the Arbitral Board's decision shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Company, such other court having jurisdiction over Company, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. If either party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the award of the Arbitral Board shall be appealed to three (3) neutral arbitrators (the \""Appellate Arbitrators\""), each of whom shall have the same qualifications and be selected through the same procedure as the Arbitral Board. The appealing party shall file its appellate brief within thirty (30) days after its written notice requesting the appeal and the other party shall file its brief within thirty (30) days thereafter. The Appellate Arbitrators shall thereupon review the decision of the Arbitral Board applying the same standards of review and all of the same presumptions) as if the Appellate Arbitrators were a California Court of Appeal reviewing a judgment of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, except that the Appellate Arbitrators shall in all cases issue a final award and shall not remand the matter to the Arbitral Board. The decision of the Appellate Arbitrators shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Company, such other court having jurisdiction over Company, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. The party appealing the decision of the Arbitral Board shall pay all costs and expenses of the appeal, including the fees of the Appellate Arbitrators and the reasonable outside attorneys' fees of the opposing party, unless the decision of the Arbitral Board is reversed, in which event the costs, fees and expenses of the appeal shall be borne as determined by the Appellate Arbitrators.\n(c) Subject to a party's right to appeal pursuant to the above, neither party shall challenge or resist any enforcement action taken by the party in whose favor the Arbitral Board, or if appealed, the Appellate Arbitrators, decided. Each party acknowledges that it is giving up the right to a trial by jury or court. The Arbitral Board shall have the power to enter temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the Arbitral Board\u2019s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Board or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section. All arbitration proceedings (including proceedings before the Appellate Arbitrators) shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with any claim of breach hereunder, each party hereby irrevocably waives any right or remedy to seek and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief or any order with respect to, and/or to enjoin or restrain or otherwise impair in any manner, the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of any motion picture, television or other audio-visual production related to the other party, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, or the use, publication or dissemination of any advertising in connection with such production; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit a party from seeking or obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief or any order based on a claim that such production uses the other party\u2019s Confidential Information to infringe upon such party's intellectual property rights.\n20. Other NDAs. The parties and certain of their affiliates are or may become party to other confidentiality agreements from time to time in connection with matters unrelated to the Potential Transaction (\u201cOther Agreements\u201d).

"      Standard NDA for Proposed M&A Transactions\nSee the following URLs in the order below for the source and background of the proposed NDA (which is not legal advice):\nhttp://www.axial.net/forum/standard-nda/?utm_campaign=DP.Blog.2015-02-19.StandardNDA&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua&elq=93614446a29f4236afc ffea78ea229b6&elqCampaignId=1407\nhttp://academy.axial.net/companies/using-the-axial-standard-nda/\nAxial Standard Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \""Agreement\""), effective as of the date last entered below (the \""Effective Date\""), is entered into by and between ______________________________ (the \""Disclosing Party\"") and the Recipient named below (the \""Recipient\"", and together with the Disclosing Party, the \""Parties\"", and each, a \""Party\"").\nIn connection with the consideration of a possible investment or financing transaction (the \""Purpose\""), the Recipient desires to receive certain information from the Disclosing Party that is non-public, confidential, or proprietary in nature; and\nIn consideration of the mutual covenants, terms and conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information. Except as set forth in Section 2 below, \""Confidential Information\"" means all non-public, confidential or proprietary information disclosed on or after the Effective Date, by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient or its affiliates, or to any of such Recipient's or its affiliates' employees, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents, attorneys, accountants, financing sources or advisors (collectively, \""Representatives\""), however disclosed, including, without limitation:\n(a) all information concerning the Disclosing Party's and its affiliates', and their customers' and suppliers', past, present and future finances, customer information, supplier information, products, services, know-how, forecasts, business, marketing, development, sales and other commercial strategies;\n(b) source and object code, programs, drawings, the Disclosing Party's unpatented inventions, ideas, methods and discoveries, trade secrets, unpublished patent applications and other confidential intellectual property; and\n(c) all notes, analyses, compilations, reports, studies, samples, data, statistics, summaries, interpretations and other materials prepared by or for the Recipient or its Representatives that contain or derive from the foregoing, and any other information that would reasonably be considered non-public, confidential or proprietary given the nature of the information and the Parties' businesses.\n2. Exclusions from Confidential Information. Except as required by applicable federal, state or local law or regulation, the term \""Confidential Information\"" as used in this Agreement shall not include information that:\n(a) at the time of disclosure is, or thereafter becomes, generally available to and known by the public other than as a result of, directly or indirectly, any act or omission by the Recipient or any of its Representatives;\n(b) at the time of disclosure is, or thereafter becomes, available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information to the Recipient by any contractual obligation;\n(c) was known by or in the possession of the Recipient, as established by documentary evidence, prior to being disclosed by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant to this Agreement;\n(d) was or is independently developed by the Recipient, as established by documentary evidence, without reference to Confidential Information; or\n(e) is Residual Information. \u201cResidual Information\u201d means the ideas, know-how and techniques that would be retained in the unaided memory of an ordinary person skilled in the art, not intent on appropriating the proprietary information of the Disclosing Party, as a result of such person\u2019s access to, use, review, evaluation, or testing of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for the purposes described herein. A person\u2019s memory is unaided if the person has not intentionally memorized the Confidential Information for the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing it. Nothing herein shall be deemed to grant to the Recipient a license under the Disclosing Party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\n3. Recipient Obligations. The Recipient shall protect and safeguard the confidentiality of all Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Recipient would protect its own confidential information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; not use the Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than the Purpose, including without limitation, to reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile or design around confidential intellectual property; not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Recipient's Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information in relation to the Purpose and are informed of the obligations hereunder and agree to abide by the same. Recipient will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information or other breaches of this Agreement.\n4. Required Disclosure. Any Disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives of any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law, regulation or a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction (a \""Legal Order\"") shall be subject to the terms of this Section. Prior to making any such disclosure, the Recipient shall make commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Disclosing Party with:\n(a) prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other remedy; and\n(b) reasonable assistance in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on disclosure.\nIf, after providing such notice and assistance as required herein, the Recipient remains subject to a Legal Order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient (or its Representatives or other persons to whom such Legal Order is directed) shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which, on the advice of the Recipient's legal counsel, such Legal Order specifically requires.\n5. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or at the Disclosing Party's request at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Recipient and its Representatives shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic or other form or media, of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and confirm the same in writing to the Disclosing Party; provided, that the Recipient and its Representatives may retain such Confidential Information as is necessary to enable it to comply with its reasonable document retention policies.\n6. Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire 18 months from the Effective Date, provided that either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing written notice to the other Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement, irrespective of termination of this Agreement, shall survive until the 18 month anniversary of this Agreement, even after the return or destruction of Confidential Information by the Recipient (the \""Confidential Period\""), provided that for any and all trade secrets of the Disclosing Party, the Confidential Period shall last for as long as such Confidential Information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable federal, state and/or local law.\n7. No Transfer of Rights, Title or Interest. The Disclosing Party hereby retains its entire right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to all Confidential Information.\n8. No Other Obligation. The Parties agree that this Agreement does not require or compel the Disclosing Party to disclose any Confidential Information to the Recipient, or obligate any party to enter into a business or contractual relationship. Either party may terminate discussions at any time.\n9. Remedies. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that money damages might not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives. Therefore, in addition to all other remedies available at law, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive and other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, and the Recipient hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond or the showing of actual monetary damages in connection with such claim.\n10. Non-Solicitation and Non-Circumvention. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, without the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent, the Recipient and its Representatives shall not contact or solicit an employee of the Disclosing Party for the purpose of hiring them, solicit the business of any client, customer or licensee of the Disclosing Party or outside of the ordinary course of business, directly or indirectly contact or participate in communications with any disclosed companies, entities or persons (including each of their affiliates, parents or subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Recipient and its Representatives shall not be restricted from hiring any employee of Disclosing Party who responds to a general solicitation for employment not directed towards the Disclosing Party\u2019s employees.\n11. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d), effective _____ (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), is entered into by and between __________ (\u201cRecipient\u201d), doing business at the following address: ____________________________________________________________________________, and the State of Ohio, Bureau of Workers' Compensation (\""Discloser\""), having offices at 30 W. Spring Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215-2256, entered into the day, month and year set out below, (each herein referred to individually as a \u201cParty,\u201d or collectively as the \u201cParties\u201d).\nWhereas, The State of Ohio, Department of Administrative Services (DAS) on behalf of Discloser has issued a Request for Competitive Sealed Proposals (RFP) CSP903918 for a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) for the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation Pharmacy Program;\nWhereas, in order for Recipient to evaluate and provide a response to the RFP, the Recipient will need access to confidential State information pertinent to providing a response to the RFP; and\nWhereas, the parties recognize that this analysis requires Recipient's review of Discloser's confidential information and that this data requires the highest degree of protection;\nNow, therefore, the parties agree to the following terms and conditions for such disclosure:\n1) In consideration of the covenants and conditions contained herein, the Parties hereby agree to the following: Non-Disclosure/Confidentiality.\na) Definition\ni) \u201cConfidential Information\u201d refers to the following items Discloser discloses to the Recipient:\n(1) Any information that is in written, graphic, machine readable, or other tangible form, and that Discloser designates as \u201cConfidential, \u201cspecifically including, but not limited to, the BWC Information Systems Documentation containing file specifications and data definitions for files and reports which will be utilized under the contract to be awarded under RFP CSP903918;\n(2) Any oral or visual information Discloser designates as \u201cConfidential\u201d at the time of disclosure;\n(3) Any source code and any names of actual or potential Disclosers, whether or not marked as confidential; and\n(4) Any other nonpublic, sensitive or third party information that is possession of Discloser and is disclosed to Recipient under this Agreement.\n(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that:\n(a) Was already in the Recipient\u2019s possession before disclosure by the Discloser, and the information was received by the Recipient without the obligation of confidence;\n(b) Is independently developed by Recipient without use of, or reference to, Confidential Information;\n(c) Is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement except as provided in 2)a)i)(6);\n(d) Is rightfully received by the Recipient from a third party without an obligation of confidence; or (e) Is disclosed by the Recipient with the written consent of the Discloser.\n(6) Although some sensitive personal information, such as medical records, addresses, telephone numbers, and social security numbers may be publicly available through other sources, the Recipient shall not disclose or use such information in any manner except as expressly authorized in this Agreement. Therefore, notwithstanding (5)(c) above, the Recipient does have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such sensitive personal information, whether or not marked as confidential.\nb) Restrictions on Use.\ni) Recipient shall not use the Confidential Information for any purpose except to evaluate and prepare a response to RFP CSP903918 for a Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) for the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation Pharmacy Program, issued by DAS on behalf of Discloser, as contemplated by this Agreement.\nii) Recipient:\n(1) Shall not disclose Confidential Information to any employee or subcontractor of Recipient unless such person needs access in order to facilitate the evaluation and preparation of a response to RFP CSP903918 and executes a nondisclosure agreement with the Recipient with terms no less restrictive than those of this Section 2)b);\n(2) Shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other third party without Discloser\u2019s prior written consent; and\n(3) Shall not reproduce Confidential Information in any form except as required to facilitate the evaluation and preparation of a response to RFP CSP903918.\niii) Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient shall protect Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar nature and importance, but with no less than reasonable care.\niv) Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any loss, release, misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information.\nv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information as required by applicable law or by proper legal or governmental authority. Recipient shall give Discloser prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with Discloser in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at Discloser\u2019s expense.\nvi) The provisions of this Section 1)b) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\nc) Injunction. The Recipient will be liable for disclosure of any Confidential Information. The Parties agree that the disclosure of Confidential Information of the Discloser may cause the Discloser irreparable damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate, and the Recipient agrees that in the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder, the Discloser shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief to enforce this provision without the necessity of proving actual damages. This provision shall not, however, diminish or alter any right to claim and recover damages.\nd) Return of Confidential Information. Upon request of Discloser or termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall return all Confidential Information, copies, extracts, or notes derived from Confidential Information to Discloser or certify, in writing, the destruction thereof. The provisions of this Section 1)d) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\ne) Retention of Rights. This Agreement does not transfer ownership of Confidential Information or grant a license thereto. Discloser retains all right, title and interest in and to all Confidential Information and its reproductions.\n2) No Obligation. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate the Discloser to proceed with any other transaction between the Discloser and the Recipient. The exchange of information does not imply imminent purchase, nor should it in any way be construed as a commitment to purchase by the State.\n3) Disputes. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of Ohio, and venue for any disputes will lie exclusively with the appropriate court in Franklin County, Ohio.\n4) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision is held by a court to be contrary to law, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n5) Amendments - Waiver. No change to any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both Parties. The failure of either Party at any time to demand strict performance by the other party of any of the terms of this Agreement will not be a waiver of those terms. Waivers must be in writing to be effective, and either Party may at any later time demand strict performance.\n6) Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon provision to the other party one (1) day written notice of election to so terminate, subject to the provisions of section 1)d) of this Agreement, provided that such unilateral termination by Recipient is without prejudice to the State of Ohio.\n7) Location of Data. Recipient affirms that it shall not and shall not allow others to take the Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information outside the United States without express written authorization from the Discloser.\n8) Authority to Sign. The person whose signature appears below on behalf of the Recipient represents and warrants that he/she has authority to bind the Recipient and all employees and agents of the Recipient to the terms of this contract and has specific authority to sign this Agreement.\n9) Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts. Each counterpart will be an original, but all such counterparts will constitute a single instrument.\n10) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes any previous agreements, whether oral or written.\n11) Effective Date. This Agreement is made effective as of the date of the last signature of the authorized representatives below.\nSTATE OF OHIO, BUREAU OF\nRECIPIENT (Company) WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION\nSignature

"      SUPPLIER NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThe undersigned individual or entity (\u201cSupplier\u201d) is, or may become a supplier of goods or services (\u201cSupplies\u201d) to KSR International Co. or an affiliated or related entity (jointly and severally referred to as \u201cCompany\u201d) for use by Company in its general business activities and/or in the provision of its own goods and services to its customers (\u201cCompany Products\u201d). Company may have provided and may provide Confidential Information to Supplier to enable Supplier to make a proposal to provide Supplies to Company and/or to provide Supplies to Company. Company was not and is not willing to recognize Supplier as a potential or an approved source for Supplies and to provide Confidential Information to Supplier, unless Supplier was, and is restricted in its use of Company\u2019s Confidential Information.\nNOW, THEREFORE, and in consideration of such acceptance and disclosures and of Company\u2019s reliance on the terms of this Supplier Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d), Supplier promises and agrees that:\n1. Confidential Information.\nA. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all trade secrets, proprietary information, know-how, and confidential information of Company including but not limited to: (i) any and all technical, business or financial information or property, owned by or licensed to Company, or otherwise relating to Company and/or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities which is heretofore or hereinafter disclosed to Supplier, including but not limited to information regarding Company\u2019s goods or services, processes, personnel, finances, business plans, studies, analyses, projections, research, market data, operations, apparatus, computer software, know-how, trade secrets, inventions, equipment, tools, molds, dies, fixtures, parts, prototypes, samples, drawings, test results, material and manufacturing specifications, suppliers, customers, employees, processes, licensing and any other ideas or information relating to Company\u2019s business or Company Products, the Supplies or any business or activity in which Company is engaged, regardless of the form of disclosure, whether or not disclosed in a writing marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or in some similar manner or identified as confidential; (ii) improvements derived by Supplier from the information identified in Subsection l(A)(i) or from access to Company\u2019s facilities; and (iii) any and all software, reports, memoranda, documents, developments, or other results produced by Supplier in the performance of providing Supplies that are directly related to Company\u2019s business and not primarily to general technology used by Supplier in the conduct of its core business.\nB. Confidential Information shall not include any information which: (a) was known to Supplier at the time of disclosure as evidenced by Supplier\u2019s written records; or (b) after disclosure by Company, is lawfully obtained by Supplier from a third party who has the right to disclose such information to Supplier; or (c) legally enters the public domain or is generally available to the public other than by an unauthorized act by Supplier or the party to which such information was originally disclosed; provided, however, Confidential Information which is composed of a combination, compilation or sequential arrangement of individual elements or features which individual elements are available to the general public or are or were known or become known to Supplier, shall be considered Confidential Information with respect to such combination, compilation or sequential arrangement.\nC. All Confidential Information is acknowledged by Supplier to be the property or an otherwise protectible interest of Company or its licensors whether or not it constitutes a trade secret.\n2. Protection of Confidential Information.\nA. Supplier shall use Confidential Information only to assist Supplier in making proposals to provide Supplies to Company and in providing Supplies to Company under Company\u2019s purchase orders or other written agreements. Supplier shall not use or disclose Confidential Information except as required by the performance of its obligations to Company. Supplier shall disclose Confidential Information only to those employees of Supplier who (a) must have the specific Confidential Information either for the development, production, testing and provision of Supplies or to decide whether to develop or supply the Supplies to Company; and (b) have signed this Agreement (or a similar agreement) binding such employees personally to the terms of this Agreement during and after their employment with Supplier. Supplier shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, including Supplier\u2019s related entities, without the prior written consent of Company and the written agreement of third parties binding them to the terms of this Agreement.\nB. Supplier shall not duplicate or summarize the Confidential Information to any third party, without the prior written consent of Company. Supplier shall not decompile or reverse engineer Company Products and any information resulting from any decompiling or reverse engineering shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of Company.\nC. The Confidential Information, and all copies, summaries, notes, and computations related thereto, shall be delivered by Supplier to Company within 48 hours of demand.\nD. In addition, Supplier shall take all reasonable precautions to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized access and use, but not less than used by Supplier to protect its own most valuable information.\nE. During and after the period Supplier is providing Supplier services to Company, Supplier shall not produce, provide, or sell to anyone, other than Company, any Supplies which include or are produced with Confidential Information.\nF. In addition, Supplier shall not and warrants that anyone obtain the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder by or through it, shall not:\n(i) Contest, anywhere in the world at any time in the future, the validity of Company\u2019s proprietary rights in, or any Company claim to the ownership or inventorship of, any Confidential Information; or\n(ii) Attempt to or actually apply for, obtain or claim ownership of, inventorship in or right to use of any proprietary rights in any Confidential Information (including, without limitation, any patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, or trade secret rights).\nG. All improvements to Company Products, their components, or their underlying technology developed during the performance of any purchase order issued by Company to Supplier shall belong to Company.\nH. Supplier shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any person that would result in a violation of United States or Canadian export or other law.\n3. Status of Supplier. Supplier\u2019s status at all times shall be that of an independent contractor, and Supplier shall not be considered an agent, partner, representative, or employee of Company for any purposes whatsoever. This Agreement shall not create an obligation on the part of Company to acquire or purchase the Supplies from Supplier. If Company accepts Supplier as an approved supplier for Supplies, any supply of such Supplies shall be under Company\u2019s standard General Terms and Conditions of Purchase without the need for further adoption of such terms and conditions. Supplier shall not advertise nor disclose that it is a potential supplier or a supplier of Supplies to Company.\n4. Miscellaneous.\nA. Supplier has not relied on any representation of Company not contained in this Agreement.\nB. The unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions and the unenforceable clause shall be deemed deleted and shall be deleted by the court.\nC. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties respecting the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, whether written or oral. It is effective on execution by Supplier. No waiver or modification of the terms of this Agreement shall be valid unless in writing and duly executed by Supplier and Company. This Agreement shall be cumulative with all other rights of Company under any existing or future agreements between Company and Supplier unless specifically waived by Company.\nD. This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of Michigan, notwithstanding principles of Michigan or any other state, provided Company may in any enforcement action elect to have the law of the forum jurisdiction to apply. The parties irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the jurisdiction in which Company has an office to resolve all issues related to or arising from this Agreement and any business relationship arising from or related to this Agreement. If the law applicable to any enforcement proceeding limits the class of information and materials protectible by contract to trade secrets or other class of information, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall be limited to those classes of information and materials. If the law applicable to any enforcement proceeding requires a temporal limitation, the period after termination for which Supplier is restricted in use or disclosure of Confidential Information which is not a trade secret shall be limited to any specific maximum permitted by law or five years from the date of termination. If the law applicable to any enforcement proceeding requires a geographic limitation, the area in which Supplier is restricted in its use or disclosure of Confidential Information shall be limited to only those states and countries in which Company or a supplier or customer of Company shall have an office or other facility during the restricted period. If the law applicable to any enforcement proceeding requires a limitation on the scope of any restriction, such restriction in the Agreement is limited to those activities which Supplier has performed for Company and to those customers of Company with which Supplier has had some contact during the engagement with Company.\nE. The interests of Company in the Confidential Information cannot be adequately protected by a remedy at law. This Agreement may be enforced by preliminary injunction as well as other available equitable and legal remedies.\nF. This Agreement is not assignable by Supplier. This Agreement binds Supplier and its affiliated companies upon execution by Supplier whether or not executed by Company.\nG.

"       SUPPLIER MUTUAL CONFIDENTIAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT SNDA-1 Rev D\nTHIS MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into by and between PaR Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d); and the party identified below (\u201cSupplier\u201d), and is effective upon the latter signature below (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\n1. Purpose. Each of the Company and Supplier desires to receive Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other for the purpose of considering a commercial transaction and/or ongoing business relationship with the other (the \u201cAuthorized Purpose\u201d). For purposes of this Agreement, the party disclosing Confidential Information is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and the party receiving Confidential Information is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cRecipient\u201d. In connection with the Authorized Purpose, certain trade secrets and business information proprietary to the Disclosing Party, and which the Disclosing Party considers confidential, may be provided to the Recipient.\n2. Definition. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information, technical data, or know-how (including, but not limited to, information relating to research, products, software, services, development, inventions, processes, engineering, marketing, techniques, customers, pricing, internal procedures, business and marketing plans or strategies, finances, employees and business opportunities) disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient, either directly or indirectly, in any form whatsoever (including, but not limited to, in writing, in machine readable or other tangible form, orally or visually): (i) that is a trade secret under applicable law; (ii) that has been marked as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d or similar legend; (iii) whose confidential nature has been made known by the Disclosing Party, orally or in writing, to the Recipient; (iv) that due to its character and nature, a reasonable person under like circumstances would treat as confidential; or (v) discussions relating to such information whether these discussions occur prior to, concurrent with, or following disclosure of such information.\n3. Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include, or shall cease to include, information or material that the Recipient can demonstrate by then-contemporaneous written records: (i) is in the Recipient\u2019s possession at the time of disclosure as shown by the Recipient\u2019s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (ii) before or after it has been disclosed to Recipient, becomes part of public knowledge or literature, not as a result of any action or inaction of the Recipient; (iii) is approved for release by written authorization of the Disclosing Party; (iv) is disclosed to the Recipient by a third party not in violation of any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to Confidential Information.\n4. Use Limitations. The Recipient (i) agrees not to use the Confidential Information for its own use or for any purposes except the Authorized Purpose expressly set forth above; (ii) shall not use the Confidential Information for purposes of unfair or improper competition; and (iii) agrees not to copy, alter, modify, disassemble, reverse engineer or decompile any of the materials unless permitted in writing by the Disclosing Party (any copies that are authorized to be made will be identified as belonging to the Disclosing Party and marked as \u201cconfidential\u201d, \u201cproprietary\u201d or with similar legend). Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the rights of the Disclosing Party to assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against the Recipient or to impose on either party any obligation to disclose any Confidential Information, to purchase or sell any products, or to otherwise enter in to any type of business relationship.\n5. Non-Disclosure. The Recipient agrees not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third parties or to any of its employees, directors, officers, agents, contractors, consultants, advisors, or other representatives (collectively \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), except those Representatives who have a need to know the Confidential Information for accomplishing the Authorized Purpose described herein. In such instance(s), the Representatives (i) shall be made aware that the Confidential Information is confidential; and (ii) that such Representatives\u2019 disclosure of the Confidential Information is restricted as set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may disclose the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information to the extent required by a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body, or by applicable law; provided, however, that the Recipient will use all reasonable efforts to promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the obligation to make such disclosure in advance of the disclosure, unless otherwise prohibited by law or court order, so that the Disclosing Party will have a reasonable opportunity to object to such disclosure. The Recipient and its Representatives shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Disclosing Party in seeking to prevent or limit disclosure; and, in the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Recipient will limit disclosure to the Confidential Information actually required to be disclosed, provided the Recipient exercises its reasonable efforts to obtain reasonable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees that it shall treat the Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it accords to its own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature; provided that in no event shall the Recipient exercise less than reasonable care to protect the Confidential Information commensurate with the sensitivity of such information. The Recipient agrees to advise the Disclosing Party in writing of any misappropriation or misuse by any person of such Confidential Information of which the Recipient may become aware.\nThe Recipient acknowledges and agrees that certain Confidential Information will be subject to export restrictions under the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) or Executive Order 12470. In such instances, in addition to general non-disclosure restrictions set forth above, such Confidential Information shall not be transferred to any foreign person in the United States or abroad, except where authorized by the United States Department of State (ITAR) or the United States Department of Commerce (EAR). Such Confidential Information shall be appropriately marked and identified at the time of transfer.\n6. Third Party Information. No party shall communicate any information to another party in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party.\n7. Return of Materials. Any materials or documents of the Disclosing Party that are furnished to the Recipient, and all copies thereof, at the earlier of the Disclosing Party\u2019s request for return of the materials, or the termination of the business relationship between the Disclosing Party and the Recipient, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s option, will either be (subject to the Disclosing Party\u2019s reasonable instructions): (i) promptly returned to the Disclosing Party and/or (ii) destroyed by the Recipient, including materials stored on the Recipient\u2019s computing environment, or electronic storage media, to the extent technically feasible (with the Recipient providing written certification of such destruction).\n8. No License. The Disclosing Party shall retain the sole ownership and right to possess its Confidential Information, and any derivatives thereof. No license is granted to the Recipient under any patents, copyrights, mask work rights or other proprietary rights by the disclosure of any information hereunder, nor is any warranty made as to such information.\n9. Remedies. The Recipient understands and agrees that the Disclosing Party is providing the Confidential Information to the Recipient in reliance upon this Agreement, and the Recipient will be fully responsible to the Disclosing Party for any damages or harm caused to the Disclosing Party by a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or any of its Representatives. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any of its promises or agreements contained herein will result in irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief, in the event of any breach or threatened breach or intended breach of this Agreement by the Recipient. Such remedies, however, shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for any breach of the Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n10. Governing Law; Venue. The validity, interpretation and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles. The parties agree that all litigation or other legal proceedings arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state courts of the State of Minnesota and the United States District Courts located therein, and the parties hereby submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.\n11. Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In the event of any litigation or other legal proceedings arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and all costs of proceedings incurred in enforcing this Agreement.\n12. Term; Termination. This Agreement shall govern all communications among the parties that are made from the date Confidential Information was first provided to or obtained by the Recipient (even if prior to the Effective Date) through the date on which a party receives from the other party written notice that such party is terminating this Agreement. The Recipient\u2019s obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information it has received or obtained prior to such termination shall continue until as long as the Confidential Information remains a trade secret or for a period of five (5) years after the date of disclosure, whichever is later.\n13. Notices. All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the receiving party at its corporate office, or as otherwise designated in writing, and shall be deemed effectively given on the earliest of : (i) when delivered, if personally delivered; (ii) on the third (3rd) business day following the date of mailing if delivered by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; (iii) on the date of transmission, if delivered by facsimile or email transmission; (iv) the scheduled day of delivery if delivered via express courier; or (v) when received by the party to whom notice is intended or required to be given.\n14. General. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other oral or written representations and understandings. This Agreement may be amended or modified only in writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement and the unenforceable or invalid provision shall be construed to be amended in order to avoid such unenforceability or invalidity while preserving as closely as possible the intent of the parties. This Agreement shall not be construed to establish a joint venture, partnership or other business relationship between the parties. No party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party(ies), which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of such party(ies); provided, however, the Company may freely assign or transfer any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder (i) to an affiliate or other subsidiary, as applicable; (ii) pursuant to merger, consolidation or other similar business combination; or (iii) to an acquirer of substantially all of the assets of the Company. This Agreement shall be binding upon the permitted successors and assigns of both parties. The relationship created under this Agreement is confidential and is to be treated as Confidential Information according to the terms of this Agreement. No waiver by a party of the conditions herein or of compliance with the provisions hereof, nor any delay by a party in exercising its rights, remedies or privileges hereunder, shall have the effect of preventing such party from exercising its rights, remedies or privileges hereunder at any future period or in any other circumstance, and no waiver shall be binding unless in writing. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each which shall constitute an original.\nThe parties hereto have caused this Supplier Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement to be duly executed by a duly authorized representative of such party as of the Effective Date.\nACKNOWLEDGED AND AGREED:\nPAR SYSTEMS, INC.

The receiving party agrees to treat the Confidential Information as confidential to and as the property of the disclosing party and to use an appropriate degree of care (which, in any case, will not be less than the degree of care it uses with respect to its own information of like nature) to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party.

The Parties acknowledge that failure on the part of the receiving party to abide by this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the disclosing party, for which damages will not be an adequate remedy.

However, the counsel for each party may retain one (1) archival copy of all Confidential Information received under this Agreement for the sole purpose of reference in any subsequent legal disputes that may arise.\n5. Limited Reproduction. The receiving party will not copy or reproduce the Confidential Information except as reasonably required for the purposes contemplated in this Agreement, and will ensure that any confidentiality or other proprietary rights notices on the Confidential Information are reproduced on all copies.\n6. Exceptions on Use and Disclosure. This Agreement does not apply to or restrict the Parties from using or disclosing:\n(a) Confidential information that is or becomes public other than through a breach of this Agreement;\n(b) Confidential information already known to the receiving party prior to the date of this Agreement (as evidenced by the receiving party's written and dated records) and with respect to which the receiving party does not have an obligation of confidentiality;\n(c) Confidential information that is independently developed by the receiving party;\n(d) Confidential information which is disclosed, without obligation of confidentiality, to the receiving party by a person or entity not party to this Agreement and who is entitled to disclose such information without breaching an obligation of confidentiality.\n7.

No Representations or Warranties; Reliance. Each of UNDP and the Company acknowledges that the other party hereto makes no any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and that the Confidential Information is not purported to represent a substitute, in whole or in part, for an independent evaluation of the operations or any transaction relating thereto.\n9. Notices.

Further Assurances. The Parties agree to deliver further written documentation and to do or cause to be done any other things reasonably necessary to implement this Agreement.\n11. Delays. Delay, failure or partial exercise by a party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any right or remedy. Any waiver must be in writing, but such waiver will be limited to its terms and will not constitute waiver of any other provision or breach of this Agreement.\n12. Severability. If any part of this Agreement is invalid, the remaining provisions still will continue in effect.\n13. Duration. This Agreement shall remain effective for a period (the \""Term\"") beginning on\nthe date signed by both Parties (the \""Commencement Date\"") and ending five (5) years after the Commencement date.\n14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets out our entire agreement concerning the matters described above and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements and understandings with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may only be amended by consent in writing of both Parties. It may be terminated by a definitive agreement relating to transactions being mutually contemplated.

The parties wish to discuss a possible commercial agreement between both companies including, but not limited to ___________________________________________________________________ (the \u201cDiscussions\u201d), which Discussions will involve the exchange of knowledge, information and know-how owned by each other.\nTHE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n1. Disclosure of Confidential Information. During the course of the Discussions, the parties may, from time to time, disclose or provide to each other, in writing or otherwise, directly, or as a consequence of their business relationship, their own trade secrets, accumulated technical or business knowledge or proprietary information as well as information which either party is required to keep confidential by contractual obligations to third parties (hereafter \""Confidential Information\""). Subject to the limitations set forth in section Five (5) below, any information that the disclosing party discloses to the receiving party shall be treated as Confidential Information of the disclosing party. Each party shall disclose only that information which it believes necessary for the other's consideration.\n2. Purpose of Disclosure. Each party shall utilize the Confidential Information disclosed by the other party only for the purpose of the Discussions and shall not divulge it to others or utilize it for commercial use or practice or for any other purpose whatsoever without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.\n3. Precautions. The party to whom disclosure of the Confidential Information has been made (the \u201creceiving party\u201d) shall treat such information as confidential and shall exercise reasonable care with respect to the Confidential Information, at least to the same degree of care as the party employs with respect to protecting its own proprietary and confidential information. A receiving party shall limit disclosure of Confidential Information to those directors, officers, employees, and agents of the party who need to know the Confidential Information in connection with the Discussions and have been advised of the confidential nature of the information.\n4. Reverse Engineering. Neither party shall attempt to reverse engineer, analyze or disassemble, or cause to be reverse engineered, analyzed or disassembled any product, formulation, process technology, sample or other technology provided by the other party, either directly or indirectly. Likewise, neither party shall provide a sample of any product or technology provided to them by the other party to any third party or entity, including but not limited to, any type of lab facility.\n5. Exceptions. Confidential Information shall not include and this Agreement shall not apply to information which:\n(a) is at the time of disclosure or later becomes known to the public through no fault of the receiving party;\n(b) has been furnished or made known on a non-confidential basis to the receiving party by a third party who has a lawful right to disclose such information;\n(c) was known by the receiving party prior to its receipt as shown by competent evidence of the receiving party;\n(d) is required by law or court order to be disclosed, but only to the extent of such required disclosure; or\n(e) is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to or use of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n6. Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) Whistleblower Immunity. 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b) states:\n\u201cAn individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal.\u201d\nAccordingly, the Parties to this Agreement have the right to disclose in confidence trade secrets to Federal, State, and local government officials, or to an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law. The Parties also have the right to disclose trade secrets in a document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, but only if the filing is made under seal and protected from public disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. Section 1833(b).\n7. Ownership. Disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of this Agreement creates no ownership or license rights in the receiving party, and the disclosing party reserves all patent, trade secret and other proprietary rights it may have in such Confidential Information.\n8. Return of Confidential Information. In the event the business relationship between the parties is not established or is terminated for any reason, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the parties shall, if either party so requests in writing, promptly return to the other party, or destroy, all written data and documents, including originals, copies, translations and reproductions thereof, whether on paper or in electronic form, embodying all or part of the Confidential Information disclosed by the other party, as directed by the disclosing party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party may retain one copy of the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party for historical, compliance, warranty and/or legal purposes, but the retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement.\n9. Export Control Law Compliance. To the extent that Confidential Information, as defined herein, is subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations under 22 CFR \u00a7 120 et. seq. of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) and 15 CFR \u00a7 730 et. seq. of the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), and by entering into this Agreement, the parties agree that they will not violate any laws and/or regulations under ITAR and EAR, and that they will not, without limitation, disclose, transfer, or export Confidential Information to third parties, including foreign persons or entities, whether or not related to or affiliated with such party, and/or subcontract out any work and/or orders arising from this Agreement, without first receiving express written consent from the disclosing party and as required by contract or by law, each party shall register with the Office of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d).\nIf either party does not comply with its obligations under this paragraph or any terms specified in the Agreement, such non-complying party will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the other party as to any violations that the non-complying party may cause under ITAR and EAR, including but not limited to the payment of civil and criminal penalties, all costs and expenses and all reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\n10. Equitable Remedies. Both parties acknowledge that their obligations in this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the other\u2019s business, and expressly agree that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate the other for any breach of any covenant in this Agreement. Therefore, each of the parties agree and acknowledge that any such violation would cause irreparable injury to the other and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, equity, or otherwise, the injured party shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement without the necessity of proving actual damages.\n11. Assignment. Neither party shall assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party.\n12. Term. The parties shall continue to protect the secrecy of the Confidential Information for as long as the information remains confidential information or a trade secret, but for no less than five (5) years from the date the information to be kept confidential is received or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later.\n13. No License, Grant or Waiver of Intellectual Property Rights. Except for the limited right to use Confidential Information set forth herein, Confidential Information remains the property of the originating party. The receiving party does not receive any right or license under any patents, copyrights, trade secrets, or the like of the originating party in or to the Confidential Information. The Confidential Information does not lose its status or protection as a trade secret or as confidential business information of the originating party merely by its disclosure to the receiving party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.\n14. No Warranty. Neither party makes any warranty whatsoever regarding any Confidential Information disclosed to the other.\n15. Binding Effect. This writing represents the entire agreement between the parties respecting secrecy and intellectual property rights regarding the Discussions and Confidential Information to which this Agreement relates. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of both parties and their successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be varied, except by a written instrument executed by both parties.\n16. Severability.

Waiver.

Governing Law and Costs. This Agreement shall be interpreted according to, the laws of the state of Florida. In any action brought to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to the award of its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs.\n19. Notices.

Definition of Confidential Information.\n(a) The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d also shall be deemed to include (i) any and all information concerning the Disclosing Party which has been or, in the future, is furnished by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives, orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium), including, without limitation, information concerning the Disclosing Party\u2019s business, operations, markets, products, services, designs, documentation, technical data or other proprietary information relating to actual, planned or possible products or services, trade secrets, events, processes, inventions (whether or not patentable), computer software and programs (in object or source code form), databases, original works of authorship, confidential knowledge, know-how, ideas, research and development, financial information, results of operations, projections, strategies, marketing information, contracts, employee information, business plans or other subject matter pertaining to the Disclosing Party and/or information regarding actual, planned or possible customers, clients, consultants, contractors, advertisers, licensees, distributors, retailers and other business associates of the Disclosing Party and/or their respective businesses, operations, activities or plans, and (ii) any and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the Confidential Information described in clause (i).\n(b) The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d does not include information which (i) is common knowledge with respect to companies operating in the industry in which the Disclosing Party conducts its business, (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives to the public or any third party in violation of this Agreement, (iii) was rightfully within the Receiving Party\u2019s or its Representatives\u2019 possession prior to its being furnished to the Receiving Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party (as reasonably demonstrated by written evidence with respect thereto), provided that the source of such information was not known by the Receiving Party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information, (iv) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information, (v) is independently developed by the Receiving Party or its Representatives without use of or reference to the Confidential Information or (vi) is required or requested to be disclosed by the Receiving Party by a governmental agency or law or other regulatory body as provided in Section 3(b), so long as the Receiving Party complies with the requirements of such section.\nSection 2. Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall (a) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, (b) hold the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in trust and keep it confidential, (c) use the same means they use to protect their own confidential information, but in any event not less than reasonable means, to prevent the disclosure by them and any of their Representatives of the Confidential Information communicated to them by the Disclosing Party and its Representatives, and (d) not copy or reproduce, or permit to be copied or reproduced, in any way, any part of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except in accordance with and for the purposes set forth in this Agreement. The Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Receiving Party and its Representatives will not disclose any of the Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever; provided, that any of such information may be disclosed by the Receiving Party to its Representatives who have a legitimate need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction with the Disclosing Party and who agree to keep such information confidential. In any event, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives, and each Party agrees, at its sole expense, to take commercially reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.\nSection 3. Confidentiality.\n(a) Each of the Parties agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, it and its Representatives will not disclose to any other person the fact that the Confidential Information has been made available to it, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction involving the Parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof), provided that the Parties may make such disclosure if required by law or the rules of any securities exchange or market. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\n(b) In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this letter agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is nonetheless, based on the advice of counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Receiving Party or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Confidential Information that such counsel advises the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose, provided that the Receiving Party exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Disclosing Party (at the Disclosing Party\u2019s expense) to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information by such tribunal.\nSection 4. Ownership of Confidential Information; No Further Rights. The Confidential Information shall at all times be the applicable Disclosing Party\u2019s sole and exclusive property, notwithstanding disclosure thereof to the Receiving Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to (a) grant or confer upon the Receiving Party any right, by license or otherwise, to make, or permit others to make, any use whatsoever of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party other than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or by any other written agreement executed after the date hereof, or (b) constitute a commitment by the Receiving Party to enter into any contractual arrangement beyond that expressly set forth herein.\nSection 5. Return of Confidential Information; Ownership. If either Party to this Agreement decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Possible Transaction with the other Party, such Party shall promptly inform the other Party of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party for any reason, the Receiving Party shall promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information (and all copies thereof) furnished to the Receiving Party or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party and shall continue to maintain the confidentiality of all other Confidential Information prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives under the terms of this Agreement. Upon request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall confirm in writing that it has returned or destroyed all Confidential Information (or continues to maintain the confidentiality of that Confidential Information prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives) and all copies thereof, in its possession. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information stored in standard archival or computer back-up systems or retained pursuant to such Person\u2019s normal document retention practices, for litigation and regulatory purposes or to the extent required by applicable law, provided that all such information retained by the Receiving Party or its Representatives shall continue to be held subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. All Confidential Information shall remain at all times the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party shall acquire no rights in or to such Confidential Information by reason of its disclosure hereunder.\nSection 6. No Warranties. The Receiving Party understands and acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives (including, without limitation, any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s directors, managers, officers, partners, members, shareholders, employees and agents) makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Receiving Party or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties that are made in a final written definitive agreement governing any Possible Transaction contemplated hereby, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.\nSection 7. Communications to Disclosing Party; Notification. The Receiving Party agrees not to initiate or maintain contact (except for those contacts made in the ordinary course of business) with any officer, director, manager, partner, member, shareholder, employee or agent of the Disclosing Party regarding its business, operations, prospects or finances, except with the express permission of the Representative(s) of the Disclosing Party identified in Section 10. It is understood that the Representative(s) of the Disclosing Party identified in Section 10 will arrange for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. Each Party agrees to give the other Party prompt notice of any violation of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any unauthorized disclosure or use of the other Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\nSection 8. No Agreement. Each of the Parties to this Agreement understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Possible Transaction involving the Parties shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a final written definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, and each of the Parties to this Agreement hereby waive in advance any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with any Possible Transaction involving such Party unless and until the Parties shall have entered into a final written definitive agreement. Each of the Parties to this Agreement further acknowledges and agrees that the other Party shall have the right to terminate discussions and negotiations with the other party at any time. Neither this section nor any other provision in this Agreement may be waived or amended except by written consent of both of the Parties to this Agreement, which consent shall specifically refer to this section (or such provision) and explicitly make such waiver or amendment.\nSection 9. Waiver. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by one Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\nSection 10. Notification. Unless otherwise agreed to by a disclosing Party, in writing, all (i) communications regarding any Possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) arrangements for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, shall be submitted (x) in the case of the Company, to Lisa Pote, Executive Director (telephone: 610-664-3020 x223 email: lpote@beckinstitute.org, or to such individual at the address for the Company set forth in the preamble of this Agreement, and (y) in the case of the Prospective Partner, to [_______________], [_______________] (telephone: [_______________], email: [_______________]), or to such individual at the address for the Prospective Partner set forth in the preamble of this Agreement, or to any of their respective designees whom one Party identifies to the other Party.\nSection 11. Remedies. It is further understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by a Party or any of its Representatives and that the other Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach (without the need to post any bond in connection therewith). Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by a Party of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to such Party. Each Receiving Party shall indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party and its officers, directors, managers, shareholders, partners, members, employees, agents and representatives forever harmless from and against any and all losses actually sustained or incurred by the Disclosing Party relating to, resulting from or otherwise arising from a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party\u2019s Representatives.\nSection 12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person or entity other than the Parties. This Agreement is for the benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement and its directors, officers, stockholders, partners, members, owners, affiliates and agents and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Each of the Parties to this Agreement also hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of the United States of America located therein for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each Party agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), and further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against either Party in any such court. This Agreement shall be binding on each Party and its successors and assigns. Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. Only a written instrument executed by the Parties may modify this Agreement. All of the provisions of this Agreement are intended to be distinct and severable. If any provision of this Agreement is or is declared to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, it shall be ineffective in such jurisdiction only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect either the balance of such provision, to the extent it is not invalid or unenforceable, or the remaining provisions hereof, nor render invalid or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. If a Provider brings any legal action against a Recipient to enforce this Agreement, and the Provider is the prevailing party in such action, then the Provider will be entitled to recover from the Recipient its reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, including those incurred on any appeal.\nSection 13. Survival; Entire Agreement. The obligations of confidentiality set forth herein shall survive for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter herein.\n[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank; Signature Page Follows]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date

All Section number references in these Terms and Conditions shall be references to provisions in these Terms and Conditions unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nBackground\nDisclosing Party or Disclosing Parties identified in the NDA own rights in such Party\u2019s Confidential Information. Each Disclosing Party considers it desirable to make Party\u2019s Confidential Information available to Receiving Party or Parties for pursuing the Purpose identified in the NDA, subject to the terms and conditions hereof.\n1. Definitions.\n\u201cAgreement\u201d means collectively (i) these Terms and Conditions, and (ii) the NDA.\n\u201cAgreement Term\u201d means the period identified as such in Section 3 of the NDA.\n \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any non-public information of a Disclosing Party described in Section 4 of the NDA which is maintained as confidential, including as examples, biological materials, computer source codes, diagrams, electronic files, invention disclosures, patent applications, technical and scientific information, research data, draft publications, technical reports, research plans, business plans, financial reports, projections, and so forth, but excluding however any information which Receiving Party can establish by competent written proof (a) was in the public domain as of the Effective Date or comes into the public domain during the term of the Agreement through no fault of Receiving Party; (b) was known to Receiving Party prior to the Effective Date and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from a Disclosing Party or from a third party under a continuing obligation of confidentiality or limited use; (c) was independently developed by Receiving Party without substantive knowledge of or assistance from the Confidential Information; or (d) was lawfully disclosed to Receiving Party from a third party who did not require Receiving Party to hold it in confidence or limit its use and who did not acquire it, directly or indirectly, from Disclosing Party under a continuing obligation of confidentiality.\n\u201cConfidentiality Term\u201d means the period identified as such in Section 3 of the NDA.\n\u201cContact Person\u201d means the person designated by a Party as responsible for that Party\u2019s receipt and/or delivery of Confidential Information as indicated in Section 2 of the NDA.\n\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d means each Party that is identified as such in Section 4 of the NDA.\n \u201cEffective Date\u201d means the date identified as such in Section 3 of the NDA.\n\u201cParties\u201d means the entities identified as the Parties in Section 1 of the NDA; and \u201cParty\u201d means any one of the Parties.\n\u201cPurpose\u201d means the reason that the Parties wish to enter into the Agreement as set forth in Section 3 of the NDA.\n\u201cReceiving Party\u201d means each Party that receives Confidential Information from a Disclosing Party.\n \u201cUS Export Controlled Information\u201d means information subject to export control by the U.S. government under the laws indicated in Section 10 hereof or otherwise.\n2.

Non-Use\nReceiving Party will not use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any reason other than the Purpose without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party.\n5.

Injunction\nThe Parties agree that, in the event of breach or threatened breach or intended breach of the Agreement, each Party, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, may seek injunctive or equitable relief without the necessity of posting bond or proving that it has no adequate remedy at law.\n10. Compliance with Laws; U.S. Export Compliance\nThe Parties acknowledge that performance of the Agreement is subject to compliance with applicable United States laws, regulations, or orders including those that may relate to the export of technical data and equipment, such as International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) and/or Export Administration Act/Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d), as may be amended, and agree to comply with all such laws, regulations or orders. No Party will export, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information without first obtaining any required export license or government approval and, in the case of Confidential Information disclosed by University, without first obtaining permission from University\u2019s Office of Sponsored Projects. In the event any Confidential Information is export-controlled, the Disclosing Party shall provide Receiving Party with written notice containing the nature of the export-controlled information, prior to any exchange of export-controlled Confidential Information.\n11. Contacts\nNotices under the Agreement will be given to a Party\u2019s person set forth in Section 1 of the NDA either by prepaid, first class, certified mail, return receipt requested or by internationally recognized overnight courier to the addresses set forth in Section 1 of the NDA or other addresses as may be given from time to time under the terms of this Section 11. Notice will be deemed given once the written notice is delivered at the designated address. Delivery via e-mail will not constitute notice.\nConfidential Information shall be delivered to the Contact Person for such Receiving Party indicated in Section 2 of the NDA or other persons specified from time to time by Receiving Party as its Contact Person by notice given in accordance with this Section 11.\n12. Other Provisions\nThe Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to choice of law principles.

If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable, all other provisions will continue in full force and effect. The Agreement supersedes any and all prior understandings or previous agreements between the Parties, oral or written, relating to the subject matter herein and constitutes the sole and complete agreement between the Parties related to the subject matter hereof. Any delay by a Party to enforce any right under the Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right, nor as a waiver of the Party\u2019s ability to later assert that right relative to any particular factual situation. The Parties acknowledge that nothing in the Agreement shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity by Parties that are state agencies.\n [End of Terms and Conditions]\n"",","exhibit, anterms,

The Disclosing Party shall not be liable for the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information.\nNothing contained herein shall grant a license under any patent or other intellectual property right, nor shall this Agreement or any transmission of information constitute any representation or warranty to the Receiving Party with respect to infringement of any intellectual property right of others.\nThe Disclosing Party has no obligation under this Agreement to purchase or sell any service or item from or to the Receiving Party.\nThe terms of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either party\u2019s right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently, or in the future, be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties, that is similar to the Confidential Information. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for its products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to, or compete with, the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Confidential Information provided that the Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.\nThe Receiving Party shall not reverse-engineer, de-compile, or disassemble any software disclosed to it and shall not remove, overprint or deface any notice of copyright, trademark, logo, legend, or other notices of ownership from any originals or copies of Confidential Information it obtains from the Disclosing Party.\n9.

"      MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis mutual non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), dated ______________ (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between HACCPCanada Foodsafety Inc. (\u201cHACCPCanada\u201d), a corporation registered in British Columbia, Canada (BC 0972472) having a business address at 2475 Dobbin Road, West Kelowna, British Columbia, V4T 2E9, and Enter Company Name ____________________________ (the \u201cSecond Party\u201d and together with HACCPCanada, the \u201cParties\u201d), located at Enter company Address _________________________________________________________________________________________. Whereas the Parties wish to explore and enter into certain business transactions (the \u201cSubject Matter\u201d) in connection with which each Party has disclosed and/or may further disclose its Confidential Information (as defined in Section 1.1) to the other Party. This Agreement is intended to allow the protection of each Party\u2019s Confidential Information (including any Confidential Information previously disclosed to the other Party) against unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIn consideration of the above premises and the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information.\n1.1. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information or data, of any kind or nature whatsoever, relating to or otherwise pertaining to a disclosing Party (the \u201cDiscloser\u201d) and/or any of the Discloser\u2019s subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, assigns or representatives, the Discloser\u2019s activities, employees, customers, subscribers, business, affairs, operations systems, software and any other information disclosed and/or otherwise made available to the other Party (the \u201cRecipient\u201d), in any form whatsoever, including any and all analyses, compilations, studies, reports or other documents prepared by the Discloser, or by its directors, officers, employees, advisers, affiliates, agents or representatives, all information relating to or otherwise pertaining to any trade secret, invention, idea, know-how, technical, financial and business information, business plans or processes, information provided by third parties to the Discloser under an obligation of confidentiality, and all information which the Recipient has been exposed to in connection with the Subject Matter. For greater certainty, all information exchanged between the Parties is to be considered Confidential Information, unless specifically stated otherwise. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d will also include this Agreement.\n1.2. The provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to information which (i) is already known to the Recipient, having been disclosed to the Recipient by a third party without such third party having an obligation of confidentiality to the Discloser; (ii) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Recipient, its employees, officers, directors or agents; (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder; (iv) is approved for release (and only to the extent so approved) by the Discloser; or (v) subject to Section 3, is disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement of a court or governmental agency or where required by operation of law.\n2. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Undertakings.\n2.1. All Confidential Information will be maintained in confidence by the Recipient, will not be disclosed to any person or entity in any way except as provided in this Agreement, and will be protected with the same degree of care the Recipient normally uses in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no case with any less degree than reasonable care.\n2.2. The Confidential Information may be disclosed by the Recipient only to those employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Recipient having the need to receive such Confidential Information for the Subject Matter, provided the recipients of such Confidential Information are already bound by written confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations similar to those undertaken by the Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. The Recipient shall immediately give notice to the Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees to assist the Discloser in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.\n2.3. The Recipient will not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Subject Matter and will not use any Confidential Information for obtaining any intellectual property rights for the Recipient or to divert or attempt to divert any business, supplier or customer of the Discloser.\n2.4. The Confidential Information shall not be mechanically copied or otherwise reproduced by the Recipient without the express prior written permission of the Discloser, except for such copies as the Recipient may be required to provide the Subject Matter. All copies shall contain, on reproduction by the Recipient, the same proprietary and confidential notices and legends which appear on the original Confidential Information, unless expressly authorized otherwise by the Discloser prior to reproduction.\n3. Restrictions. To the extent the Recipient is required to disclose any Confidential Information pursuant to a valid subpoena or other applicable order by a governmental agency or judicial body or by operation of law, the Recipient will promptly notify the Discloser in writing of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such disclosure so that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority. The Recipient agrees to cooperate with the Discloser in seeking such order or remedy. The Recipient further agrees that if the Recipient is required to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable, written assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information.\n4. Other Matters.\n4.1. Neither this Agreement, nor either Party\u2019s performance under this Agreement, will transfer to the Recipient, or be construed to grant the Recipient, any proprietary right, license title, interest, licence or claim in or to any of the Confidential Information, other than the right to use the same strictly for the Subject Matter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Discloser is and shall remain the full and exclusive owner or licensee of the Confidential Information and the intellectual property rights thereto, including but not limited to derivatives, alterations, modifications and other changes thereto, whether made by the Discloser or the Recipient.\n4.2. The Recipient shall not use the name or any trademark of the Discloser in any manner, including, without limitation, in any press release or other advertising materials of the Recipient or any of its affiliates, without the prior written consent of the Discloser, which consent may be rejected or withdrawn at the Discloser\u2019s sole discretion. For the removal of doubt, an Authorization to Use Corporate Logos shall constitute written consent.\n4.3. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it has the legal power and authority to enter into and perform under this Agreement.\n4.4. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any obligation or any expectation on either Party to enter into a business relationship with the other Party, or an obligation to refrain from entering into a business relationship with any third party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership or employment relationship between the Parties, it being understood that the Parties are independent contractors vis-\u00e0-vis one another. Except as specified herein, no Party shall have the right, power or implied authority to create any obligation or duty, express or implied, on behalf of any other Party hereto.\n5. Equitable Relief. The Recipient agrees that, in the event of any breach of any provision hereof, the Discloser may, or will, not have an adequate remedy in money or damages. The Recipient therefore agrees that, in such event, the Discloser shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against such breach in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such injunctive relief will in no way limit the Discloser\u2019s right to obtain other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by the Discloser hereto in enforcing any right, power or privilege created hereunder shall operate as an implied waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial enforcement thereof preclude any other or further enforcement thereof or the enforcement of any other right, power or privilege.\n6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement consists of the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior written or oral agreements with respect hereto. This Agreement may not be modified except by written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of each party hereto.\n7. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by either Party except by express written consent by a duly authorized representative of the other Party, provided that HACCPCanada may assign this Agreement in conjunction with a sale of its business as a going concern.\n8. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.\n9. Severability. In the event that any covenant, condition, term, restriction or other provision contained in this Agreement, or any portion thereof, shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision or portion shall be fully severable from this Agreement and the other provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect and will be liberally construed to carry out the provisions and intent hereof.\n10. Term and Survival.\n10.1. This Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and terminate on the expiry or termination of any engagement in relation to the Subject Matter between the Parties. Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, the Recipient (i) will cease to use the Confidential Information received from the Discloser, (ii) within thirty (30) days after the date of termination or expiry of this Agreement, will return to the Discloser all original Confidential Information thereof then in its possession or control, (iii) if the Discloser requests in writing, within thirty (30) days after the date of termination or expiry of this Agreement, will return to the Discloser all copies of the Confidential Information requested by the Discloser, (iv) if no request from the Discloser has been received within thirty (30) days of the termination or expiry of this agreement for the return of any copies of the Confidential Information, will destroy all copies thereof then in its possession or control and (v) upon the written request of the Discloser, will furnish the Discloser with written certification of such destruction.\n10.2. The obligations of confidentiality and restricted use contained herein will survive for a period of five (5) years from the date of receipt of any Confidential Information from the Discloser under this Agreement.\n11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or other electronic means, in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the duly authorized representatives of the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.\nHACCPCanada Foodsafety Inc.

WHEREAS, Ameren Illinois is in possession of certain proprietary and confidential data and information relating to municipal customer service and account data;\nWHEREAS, Ameren Illinois has agreed to the disclosure of such data and information to Recipient; and\nWHEREAS, Ameren Illinois desires to have all such information handled by Recipient on a confidential basis.\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the execution of this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, and the covenants made herein, the Parties agree that the disclosure of such information by Ameren Illinois to Recipient is subject to the following terms and conditions:\n1. Receipt of Information. Ameren Illinois disclose to Recipient, customer information protected from public disclosure pursuant to 815 ILCS 505/2HH (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) for use by the Recipient and its officers, directors, agents, employees and contractors (collectively, the \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), on a need-to-know basis for the purpose of facilitating electric supply aggregation pursuant to 20 ILCS 3855/1-92.\n2. Confidential Information Defined. The Parties acknowledge that any such information referred to in paragraph above shall be considered Confidential Information. Under this Agreement, all information disclosed by the Ameren Illinois whether provided in oral, written, visual, electronic or other form is presumed to be Confidential Information unless it falls within one of the exclusions of Section 3. Confidential Information includes non-public customer specific information. Confidential Information as used herein also includes information supplied by Ameren Illinois to Recipient prior to the execution of this Agreement, and such Confidential Information shall be considered in the same manner and be subject to the same treatment as the Confidential Information made available after the execution of this Agreement.\n3. Exclusions from Definition. Confidential Information as used herein does not include any information which (i) is already known to the Recipient at the time it is disclosed to the Recipient, provided that such prior knowledge can be substantiated by written records and documents or (ii) is or has become generally known to the public through no wrongful act of the Recipient, (iii) information permitted to be disclosed by express written authority of a customer or customers, (iv) is obtained by the Recipient from a third party who has the right, to the best of the Recipient\u2019s knowledge, to disclose the information, or (v) is required or permitted to be disclosed in order to facilitate electric supply aggregation pursuant to Illinois law.\n4. Non-Disclosure Obligation. The Recipient shall maintain the confidentiality of any Confidential Information and shall not disclose such Confidential Information, in whole or in part, to any person other than its Representatives who need to know such Confidential Information. Representatives shall be informed by the Recipient of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall be directed by the Recipient to treat the Confidential Information confidentially, except with the prior written consent of Ameren Illinois or as otherwise permitted hereunder. Each Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representative.\n5. Compliance with Legal Process. In the event that the Recipient is legally requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or; in the opinion of counsel for the Recipient , by federal or state securities or other statutes, regulations or laws) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient shall promptly notify Ameren Illinois of such request or requirement prior to disclosure so that Ameren Illinois may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n6.

In the event that Ameren Illinois is a named party in a lawsuit related to the improper disclosure of customer information by the Recipient or its Representatives, Recipient will reimburse Ameren Illinois for its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, damages awarded) incurred in connection with such litigation. In the event Ameren is adjudicated to have any comparative fault, Ameren Illinois shall be responsible only for its respective share of ordered and apportioned damages.

Termination of this agreement may result in the suspension of information listing services provided by Ameren Illinois.\n10. No Waiver; Amendment; Exclusive Agreement. No failure or delay by either of the Parties in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement shall not be modified, supplemented or amended except by a writing signed by both Parties hereto. This Agreement represents the exclusive agreement between the Parties in connection with the subject matter hereof.\n11. Applicability to Affiliates. Any Confidential Information disclosed by an affiliated company of Ameren Illinois which would otherwise constitute Confidential Information hereunder if disclosed by Ameren Illinois, shall be deemed to constitute Confidential Information under this Agreement, and the rights of Ameren Illinois under this Agreement may be enforced by any such affiliate as if such affiliate were also a Party to this Agreement.\n12. APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY ILLINOIS LAW, AND SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED AND PERFORMED IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.\n13. Notices.

When informed of the proprietary and confidential nature of Confidential Information that has been disclosed by the other Party, the receiving Party (\u201cRecipient\u201d) shall, for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure, refrain from disclosing such Confidential Information to any contractor or other third party without prior, written approval from the disclosing Party and shall protect such Confidential Information from inadvertent disclosure to a third party using the same care and diligence that the Recipient uses to protect its own proprietary and confidential information, but in no case less than reasonable care. The Recipient shall ensure that each of its employees, officers, directors, or agents who has access to Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement is informed of its proprietary and confidential nature and is required to abide by the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient of Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall promptly notify the disclosing Party of any disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement or of any subpoena or other legal process requiring production or disclosure of said Confidential Information.\n3.

The disclosing party acknowledges that the Recipient may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties, that is similar to the Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Recipient from developing or having developed for it products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Confidential Information provided that the Recipient does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.\n5. Notwithstanding the above, the Parties agree that information shall not be deemed Confidential Information and the Recipient shall have no obligation to hold in confidence such information, where such information:\n(a) Is already known to the Recipient, having been disclosed to the Recipient by a third party without such third party having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; or\n(b) Is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Recipient, its employees, officers, directors, or agents; or\n(c) Is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder; or\n(d) Is approved for release (and only to the extent so approved) by the disclosing Party; or\n(e) Is disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement of a court or governmental agency or where required by operation of law.\n6.

Neither Party will, without prior approval of the other Party, make any public announcement of or otherwise disclose the existence or the terms of this Agreement.\n8. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties and in no way creates an obligation for either Party to disclose information to the other Party or to enter into any other agreement.\n9. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of three (3) years from the Effective Date unless otherwise terminated by either Party giving notice to the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement.

No Warranty. No warranty or representation is made by either party hereto that any information transmitted by it hereunder is true and correct, patentable or copyrightable, or that any such information involves concepts or embodiments that are free of infringement of other rights.\n7.

This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the parties.\n13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\n15. Waiver.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT (the \""Agreement\u201d) is entered into on this ____day of ___________ by and between _________________, located at ___________________ ( the\u201d Disclosing Party\u201d), and ___________________________ with an address at ______________________ (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\nThe Receiving Party hereto desires to participate in discussions regarding ________________________ (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). During these discussions, Disclosing Party may share certain proprietary information with the Receiving Party. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information.\n(a) For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, in whatever medium provided, whether unmodified or modified by Receiving Party or its Representatives (as defined herein), whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial information, or projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans and performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such party, its affiliates, subsidiaries and affiliated companies; (ii) plans for products or services, and customer or supplier lists; (iii) any scientific or technical information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, improvement, technology or method; (iv) any concepts, reports, data, know-how, works-in-progress, designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; (v) any other information that should reasonably be recognized as confidential information of the Disclosing Party; and (vi) any information generated by the Receiving Party or by its Representatives that contains, reflects, or is derived from any of the foregoing. Confidential Information need not be novel, unique, patentable, copyrightable or constitute a trade secret in order to be designated Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is proprietary to the Disclosing Party, has been developed and obtained through great efforts by the Disclosing Party and that Disclosing Party regards all of its Confidential Information as trade secrets.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include information which: a) was lawfully possessed, as evidenced by the Receiving Party\u2019s records, by the Receiving Party prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes rightfully known by the Receiving Party from a third-party source not under an obligation to Disclosing Party to maintain confidentiality; (c) is generally known by the public through no fault of or failure to act by the Receiving Party inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; (d) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or is otherwise requested or required to be disclosed by law or regulation, although the requirements of paragraph 4 hereof shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been independently developed by employees, consultants or agents of the Receiving Party without violation of the terms of this Agreement, as evidenced by the Receiving Party\u2019s records, and without reference or access to any Confidential Information.\n2. Disclosure of Confidential Information.\nFrom time to time, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party will: (a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives (collectively \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who have a need to know such Confidential Information in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties to which this Agreement relates, and only for that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement, require such Representatives to be bound by written confidentiality restrictions no less stringent than those contained herein, and assume full liability for acts or omissions by its Representatives that are inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement; (c) keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and (d) not disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein).\n3. Use of Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties and not for any purpose other than as authorized by this Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party. No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to the Receiving Party hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in the Disclosing Party. All use of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit of the Disclosing Party and any modifications and improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing contained herein is intended to modify the parties' existing agreement that their discussions in furtherance of a potential business relationship are governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 408.\n4. Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.\nNotwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial, or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, regulatory request or similar method, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure so that the Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided that the Receiving Party will disclose only that portion of the requested Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with efforts by, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a protective order and the Receiving Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability.\n5. Term.\nThis Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to a one year extension if the parties are still discussing and considering the Transaction at the end of the second year). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party\u2019s duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information that was disclosed during term shall remain in effect indefinitely.\n6. Remedies.\nBoth parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information to be disclosed hereunder is of a unique and valuable character, and that the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would destroy or diminish the value of such information. The damages to Disclosing Party that would result from the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would be impossible to calculate. Therefore, both parties hereby agree that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief preventing the dissemination of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies available hereunder, whether at law or in equity. Disclosing Party shall be entitled to recover its costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief. Further, in the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.\n7. Return of Confidential Information.\nReceiving Party shall immediately return and redeliver to Disclosing Party all tangible material embodying any Confidential Information provided hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, drawings, manuals, records, excerpts or derivative information deriving therefrom, and all other documents or materials (\u201cNotes\u201d) (and all copies of any of the foregoing, including \u201ccopies\u201d that have been converted to computerized media in the form of image, data, word processing, or other types of files either manually or by image capture) based on or including any Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or retrieval, upon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the dealings between the parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of this Agreement; or (iii) at such time as the Disclosing Party may so request; provided however that the Receiving Party may retain such of its documents as is necessary to enable it to comply with its reasonable document retention policies. Alternatively, the Receiving Party, with the written consent of the Disclosing Party may (or in the case of Notes, at the Receiving Party\u2019s option) immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying Confidential Information (or the reasonably nonrecoverable data erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing such destruction by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party supervising the destruction).\n8. Notice of Breach.\nReceiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of, or suspicion of, (1) any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by Receiving Party or its Representatives; or (2) any actions by Receiving Party or its Representatives inconsistent with their respective obligations under this Agreement, Receiving Party shall cooperate with any and all efforts of the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.\n9. No Binding Agreement for Transaction.\nThe parties agree that neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time. This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between the parties. If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any applicable transaction documents entered into between the parties (or their respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this Agreement. In the event such provision is not provided for in said transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.\n10. Warranty.\nNO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER. The parties acknowledge that although they shall each endeavor to include in the Confidential Information all information that they each believe relevant for the purpose of the evaluation of a Transaction, the parties understand that no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information is being made by the Disclosing Party. Further, neither party is under any obligation under this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information it chooses not to disclose. Neither Party hereto shall have any liability to the other party or to the other party\u2019s Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with respect to disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.\n11. Miscellaneous.\n(a) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can only be modified by a written amendment signed by the party against whom enforcement of such modification is sought.\n(b) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of _____________________ (state) applicable to contracts made and to be wholly performed within such state, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof. The Federal and state courts located in _______________ (state) shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under, or in any way connected with or related to, the terms of this Agreement and Receiving Party: (i) consents to personal jurisdiction therein; and (ii) waives the right to raise forum non conveniens or any similar objection.\n(c) Any failure by either party to enforce the other party\u2019s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n(d) Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any such restriction is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was not included.\n(e) Any notices or communications required or permitted to be given hereunder may be delivered by hand, deposited with a nationally recognized overnight carrier, electronic-mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case, to the address of the other party first indicated above (or such other addressee as may be furnished by a party in accordance with this paragraph). All such notices or communications shall be deemed to have been given and received (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, on the third business day following dispatch and (c) in the case of mailing, on the seventh business day following such mailing.\n(f) This Agreement is personal in nature, and neither party may directly or indirectly assign or transfer it by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. All obligations contained in this Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, assigns and designees.\n(g) The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will not prevent or in any way limit either party from: (i) developing, making or marketing products or services that are or may be competitive with the products or services of the other; or (ii) providing products or services to others who compete with the other.\n(h) Paragraph headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not be used or relied upon in the interpretation of this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.\nDisclosing Party Receiving Party\nBy By

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made as of May __, 2015, by and between __________________________________________________ (\u201cPotential Purchaser\u201d) and Simply Fashions Stores, Ltd., and Adinath Corp. (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d and together with Potential Purchaser, collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d). Potential Purchaser desires to obtain certain confidential and proprietary information from the Company with respect to (i) one of more of the existing leases of non-residential real property related to the Company\u2019s store locations (collectively, the \u201cLeases\u201d), and/or (ii) intellectual property owned by the Company, (collectively, the \u201cIP\u201d), and/or (iii) any other assets of the Company (collectively, the \u201cOther Assets\u201d) in order to evaluate the possibility of an acquisition, or asset purchase, involving one or more of the Leases or some or all of the IP or Other Assets (each, a \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d). As a condition to furnishing any information which is confidential and/or proprietary in nature to Potential Purchaser, the Company requires that Potential Purchaser agree to treat confidentially all written information of a proprietary or confidential nature, that the Company furnishes to Potential Purchaser (including, but not limited to, copies of the Leases), except as may otherwise herein be provided (collectively being the \u201cEvaluation Materials\u201d), and the Parties agree to keep confidential, communications by and between the Parties of a proprietary or confidential nature, arising from or relating to the Proposed Transaction.\nNOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the Parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Potential Purchaser recognizes and acknowledges that the Evaluation Materials may contain confidential and/or proprietary information regarding the Company. Potential Purchaser shall maintain the confidentiality of those portions of the Evaluation Materials that contain confidential and/or proprietary information, and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, disclose, those portions of the Evaluation Materials to any third party, except as otherwise set forth herein. Potential Purchaser may disclose the Evaluation Materials to its parents, subsidiaries, parents\u2019 subsidiaries, or affiliates (collectively, the \u201cAffiliated Entities\u201d) and Potential Purchaser\u2019s and/or the Affiliated Entities\u2019, directors, officers, employees, partners, consultants, potential financing sources, joint-venture partners, bankers, accountants, lenders, investors, insurance consultants and/or brokers, attorneys, agents and financial and legal advisors (collectively, such entities or persons to whom Potential Purchaser or an Affiliated Entity discloses the Evaluation Materials, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who may need access to the Evaluation Materials, in Potential Purchaser\u2019s discretion, for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction. Potential Purchaser shall (i) inform in writing all of its Representatives who receive any portion of the Evaluation Materials of the confidential and proprietary nature thereof and of this Agreement and (ii) direct all such Representatives in writing to comply with the confidentiality and non-use terms of this Agreement. Potential Purchaser shall keep those portions of the Evaluation Materials confidential, as hereinabove provided.\n2. Potential Purchaser shall not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Potential Purchaser and its Affiliated Entities and Representatives may invest in or consider or manage investments in companies that compete either directly or indirectly with the Company and that this Agreement shall in no way be construed to prohibit or restrict Potential Purchaser\u2019s or its Affiliated Entities or Representatives\u2019 ability to make or manage or consider such investments.\n3. This Agreement shall not apply to, and Potential Purchaser shall have no obligation with respect to, any information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public through no breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser, or actual knowledge by Potential Purchaser of breach by its Representatives, (ii) was already known by Potential Purchaser or a third party, or in Potential Purchaser\u2019s possession prior to the date of this Agreement, (iii) becomes available to Potential Purchaser on a non-confidential basis from a source, other than the Company or its agents, which is or was not known to be prohibited from disclosing such portions of the Evaluation Materials by a contractual or legal obligation to the Company, (iv) is independently developed or acquired by Potential Purchaser without violation of this Agreement, or (v) is or was of a non-proprietary nature.\n4. In the event that Potential Purchaser, its Affiliated Entities, and/or its Representatives receive a request or are required to disclose any of the Evaluation Materials, pursuant to any applicable law, rule, regulation, regulatory authority, subpoena, order, summons, lawsuit, or other applicable judicial or governmental order, or any other legal process, Potential Purchaser shall provide the Company with prompt notice so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy at the Company\u2019s expense. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not timely obtained, or the Company waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, Potential Purchaser, its Affiliated Entities, and/or its Representatives may furnish and disclose any or all of the Evaluation Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to the Company shall not be required where disclosure is in connection with a routine audit or examination by, or a blanket document request from, a governmental or regulatory authority having or claiming to have authority to regulate or oversee Potential Purchaser\u2019s business, provided that Potential Purchaser informs such governmental or regulatory authority of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Materials.\n5. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof by the Company preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power and privilege hereunder. It is further understood and agreed that money damages alone may not constitute a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives, and that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief, as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies available to the Company for a breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity.\n6. Potential Purchaser shall destroy or return the Evaluation Materials to the Company (at Potential Purchaser\u2019s option) and direct its Representatives to do the same upon the Company\u2019s written request. If Potential Purchaser elects to destroy, Potential Purchaser shall destroy those portions of any projections, appraisals, memoranda, notes, analyses, compilations, studies and other documents, including copies or extracts thereof, that contain Evaluation Materials, prepared by Potential Purchaser and direct its Representatives to do the same, provided in each instance, the same is reasonably possible without destroying or affecting Potential Purchaser, it\u2019s Affiliated Entities\u2019, or its Representatives\u2019 computer programs, server, software, or the like. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Potential Purchaser, its Affiliated Entities, and its Representatives may retain one or more copies of the Evaluation Materials for the purpose of defending any claim related to this Agreement or any transaction related hereto, or as may be required in accordance with Potential Purchaser\u2019s, its Affiliated Entities, or its Representatives\u2019 respective legal, compliance, computer programs, server, software, and/or automated backup archiving practices.\n7. Potential Purchaser understands that the Company will endeavor to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to the Company which the Company believes to be relevant for the purpose of Potential Purchaser\u2019s evaluation of the Proposed Transaction. Potential Purchaser further understands and acknowledges that the Company does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials or any portion thereof. Potential Purchaser agrees that neither the Company nor its agents shall have any liability to Potential Purchaser or any of its Representatives resulting from the use of the Evaluation Materials by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives by virtue of this Agreement.\n8. Unless and until a definitive binding agreement is entered into between the Company and Potential Purchaser (or any of its affiliates) with respect to the Proposed Transaction, none of the parties hereto will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to consummate, or otherwise with respect to, any Proposed Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such definitive binding agreement, neither party hereto shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.\n9. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, arrangements and agreements, whether oral or in writing, between the parties relating in any way to such subject matter. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum, web-based database or similar repository of Evaluation Materials to which Potential Purchaser or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, \u201cclicking\u201d on an \u201cI Agree\u201d icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that Potential Purchaser\u2019s confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Materials are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be enlarged except by an agreement executed by the parties hereto in traditional written format.\n10. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, provided each Party receives a signed counterpart of the other Party. Facsimile signatures or otherwise electronically transmitted signatures (such as via e-mail in pdf format) may be used with the same force and effect as original signatures. The term of this agreement shall be the earlier of: (i) six (6) months from the date hereof; or (ii) the consummation of a Proposed Transaction even if such Proposed Transaction is between the Company (or its Representatives) and a non-related third party.\n11. The parties voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (Miami Division) (the court in which is currently pending the chapter 11 cases of the Company) to resolve any dispute with respect to any issue related to, or arising in connection with, this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto, duly authorized, have caused this Confidentiality Agreement to be executed as of the date first above written.\nCompany: Simply Fashion Stores, LTD., and Adinath Corp.\nSignature: ________________________________________\nName:

DEFINITIONS\n\u201cAffiliate\u201d means any entity (including without limitation any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company or group) that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party. \u201cAuthorized Parties\u201d means directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, service providers, consultants and/or sub-contractors.\n\u201cProprietary Information\u201d means confidential, non-public or other proprietary information including, without limitation, trade secrets, technical information, including algorithms, code, data, designs, documentation, drawings, formulae, hardware, software, know-how, ideas, inventions, whether patentable or not, photographs, recordings, procedures, processes, reports, research, samples, sketches, specifications, operations, plans, products, financial information, including pricing and other proprietary information that is disclosed under the terms of this Agreement by Disclosing Party or its Affiliates to the Recipient. Proprietary Information shall be marked as proprietary, confidential or with another suitable legend at the time of disclosure or otherwise designated in writing as proprietary by the Disclosing Party within thirty (30) days of disclosure. Proprietary Information shall not include information which: (i) is or becomes a part of the public domain without any action by, or involvement of, Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties; (ii) is received by Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties from a third party without a duty of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party; (iii) is independently developed by Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties without use of or without reference to the Proprietary Information; (iv) is already in the possession of Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties and Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties can demonstrate with written proof that the information was in the possession of Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties prior to the disclosure of the Proprietary Information by the Disclosing Party; or (v) is disclosed by Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party.\n2. CONFIDENTIALITY\n2.1. Curtiss-Wright and Company agree that, as a condition to the receipt of Proprietary Information hereunder, Recipient shall: (i) not disclose, directly or indirectly, to any third party any portion of the Proprietary Information without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party (except to its Affiliates, and its or their Authorized Parties who have a need to know the Proprietary Information and only to the extent necessary for the Purpose); (ii) not use the Proprietary Information except for the Purpose; (iii) promptly return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, all materials and documentation containing the Proprietary Information received hereunder except for copies of any computer records or electronic files containing the Proprietary Information, which have been created by automated processes such as archiving or back-up procedures; (iv) take all reasonably necessary precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information received hereunder and exercise at least the same degree of care in safeguarding the Proprietary Information as Recipient, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties would with its own proprietary information; (v) inform all Authorized Parties of Recipient and its Affiliates to whom Proprietary Information may be disclosed or made available of the proprietary interest of the Disclosing Party therein and of the obligations of Recipient with respect thereto; and (vi) promptly advise the Disclosing Party in writing upon learning of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Proprietary Information.\n2.2.

If either party or any of their respective Affiliates or Authorized Parties is requested or required, by interrogatories, subpoena, or similar legal process, to disclose any Proprietary Information, such party agrees to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of each such request, to the extent practicable, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order, waive compliance by the Recipient with the provisions of this Agreement, or both. If, absent the entry of a protective order or receipt of a waiver, the Recipient is, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose such Proprietary Information, the Recipient may disclose such Proprietary Information to the persons and to the extent required without liability under this Agreement and will use best efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Proprietary Information so disclosed.\n2.4.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement is made and entered into by execution of this document or a duplicate hereof effective this ___[Date]___, by and between, TPI Composites, Inc. a company established under the laws of Delaware and having its registered offices at 8501 N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 280, Scottsdale, Arizona 85253, as well as all of its subsidiaries, affiliates divisions and units of such corporation, entities or businesses related in any way to TPI Composites, Inc., including, but not limited to joint ventures (hereinafter referred to as \""TPI\"") and [Insert Company] , having its registered offices at [Address] (hereinafter referred to as \"" \""). The term \""Party\"" or \""Parties\"" as used herein refers to one or both of the foregoing entities, depending on context.\nWHEREAS, TPI is a company that develops and manufactures large-scale composite materials for the wind energy, transportation and military markets;\nWHEREAS, TPI has developed valuable technology, know-how, trade secrets, and other confidential information relating to reinforced plastic composite materials and processes;\nWHEREAS, [Insert Company] desires to receive and examine certain confidential data of TPI relating to composite materials and/or other products that TPI has obtained, designed, manufactured or developed for use in the wind energy, transportation or military markets;\nWHEREAS, TPI is willing to provide [Insert Company] certain confidential and proprietary data relating to the above-referenced technology and processes; and\nWHEREAS, the Parties desire to define and set out the terms and conditions which prevent each of the Parties from any unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information as stipulated hereinbelow.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. \u201cProprietary Information,\u201d as used herein, shall mean any and all samples, formula, methods, know-how, technology, software, material, engineering data, specifications, sketches, drawings, schematics, designs, manufacturing processes, test results, compilations, and any other material, information, ideas, concepts or knowledge which a party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) furnishes to another party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d): (i) in written or other tangible form whether marked with a proprietary legend or not, or (ii) in oral or visual form that is identified as proprietary at the time of disclosure and is summarized and designated proprietary in a written memorandum delivered to Receiving Party within thirty (30) days of the disclosure. Examples of such Proprietary Information include, but are not limited to, pricing, computer programs, computer code, modules, scripts, algorithms, features, and modes of operation, inventions (whether or not patentable), techniques, processes, methodologies, know-how, schematics, testing procedures, design and function specifications, documentation, and the features, mode of operation and other details of Disclosing Party\u2019s products and services, as well as the names and expertise of Disclosing Party\u2019s employees, product development plans and forecasts.\nSuch Proprietary Information shall not include information which (1) is in or (other than by an act attributable to the Receiving Party) passes into the public domain; (2) was in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure thereof by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party; (3) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party who lawfully possesses such information and who is duly authorized or otherwise entitled to disclose such information; (4) is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a government body, court or administration agency; or (5) is independently developed by an employee of the Receiving Party who has not had access to the information disclosed hereunder.\n2. Proprietary Information shall be held in strict confidence by Receiving Party and shall not be used by Receiving Party except for (i) the purposes described in this Agreement, unless disclosure or further use is authorized or consented to in writing by Disclosing Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and/or (ii) the case where disclosure of the same is required under applicable law or by a governmental order, rule or regulation or by the regulations of any relevant stock exchange or other governmental authority (provided that the Receiving party shall give written notice of such required disclosure to the other party prior to the disclosure).\nSuch consent to disclose Proprietary Information to employees of Receiving Party or its affiliated company (\u201caffiliated Receiving Party\u201d) with a legitimate \u201cneed to know\u201d and only for the purposes described in this Agreement is herewith given, but further consent shall be required for disclosure to others or authorization of use by others. For purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement, an \""affiliated Receiving Party\"" means and includes a parent, if any, of Receiving Party and all present and future companies in which Receiving Party, or its parent, individually or collectively, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, owns or controls fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding stock having the right to vote for or appoint directors thereof. Prior to any use or disclosure of Proprietary Information by or to another, Receiving Party shall ensure that the recipient has entered into an agreement limiting the recipient's disclosure and use of Proprietary Information consistent with this Agreement.\n3. To enable the Disclosing Party to disclose \u201ctechnical data\u201d to the Receiving Party in compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administrative Regulations, the Receiving Party hereby gives its assurance to the Disclosing Party that the Receiving Party will not knowingly, unless prior written authorization is obtained from the Disclosing Party and the U.S. Commerce Department, export, re-export or otherwise disclose, directly or indirectly, any \u201ctechnical data\u201d (or computer software and any related documentation) received from the Disclosing Party which is not otherwise available to the general public, nor allow the direct product thereof to be shipped directly or indirectly, to any of the countries published on the restrictive list promulgated and amended from time to time by the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Paragraph 3 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n4. Immediately upon a request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof or upon request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall certify in writing that all materials containing Proprietary Information (including all copies thereof) have been destroyed. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (a) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, which shall be disclosed if at all solely at the option of the Disclosing Party, or (b) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any proposed transaction or relationship in connection with which Proprietary Information may be disclosed.\n5. No rights or obligations other than those expressed and recited herein are to be implied from this Agreement. In particular, no licenses are hereby granted directly or indirectly under any patent, copyright, or trademark now held by or which may be obtained by, or which is licensable by Disclosing Party, including but not limited to, any license to make, use or sell any product embodying any Proprietary Information. No other existing Agreement between parties, if any, are modified or terminated by this Agreement. No warranty or representation is made by Disclosing Party hereto that any information transmitted by it hereunder is patentable or copyrightable, or that any such information involves concepts or embodiments that are free of infringement of other rights.

Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other Party sixty (60) days\u2019 written notice. However the confidentiality obligations and all powers, rights and duties provided herein shall extend for a period of five (5) years following the termination of this Agreement. Neither Party shall assign this Agreement to any third party, without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n7. The Parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Proprietary Information, money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of this Agreement. Because a violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement will likely cause irreparable loss and harm which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages in an action at law, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief or other appropriate equitable relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Disclosing Party.\n8. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of law principles. Any dispute, controversy and/or difference which may arise between the Parties out of or in relation to or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach thereof, which cannot be settled by amicable mutual accord without undue delay, shall be filed in the courts of Delaware.\n9. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all prior communications, understandings and agreements between the Parties hereto relating to the Proprietary Information, whether written or oral, expressed or implied. The Parties agree that this Agreement is severable and that in the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or enforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected or impaired.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have respectively caused duplicates of this document to be executed on their behalf by their proper officers and employees thereunto duly authorized.\n[TPI Composites, Inc.] [Insert Company]\nBy: By:\n(Signature) (Signature)\nName: Name:\n(Print) (Print)\nTitle: Title:\n"",","nondisclosure, agreementnthis,

"      Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement\n1. In connection with discussions between [INSERT LEGAL ENTITY NAME OF SUPPLIER] (\u201cCompany\u201d) and the Wayne Fueling Systems LLC with respect to a transaction involving the purchase and/or sale of goods and/or services (the \u201cTransaction\u201d), each party (as to information disclosed by it, the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) is prepared to furnish the other party (as to information received by it, the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) with certain confidential and proprietary information. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d as used in this agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) shall mean all such information that is or has been disclosed by the Disclosing Party or its Affiliates (defined below): (i) in writing or by email or other tangible electronic storage medium and is clearly marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d; or (ii) orally or visually, and then followed within ten (10) working days thereafter with a disclosure complying with the requirements of clause (i) above. Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to, personal data as defined in this Agreement or by applicable law, whichever is broader, and personal data shall not be required to be marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d to be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, \u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating: (i) to an identified; or (ii) to a directly or indirectly identifiable, natural person. All other information shall be deemed to be non-confidential. As used in this Agreement, an \u201cAffiliate\u201d with respect to a party means any entity (including without limitation any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company or group) that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such party.\n2. The Receiving Party agrees, except as required by law, to: (i) protect the confidentiality of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information in whatever form maintained, including any notes, summaries, reports, analyses or other material derived by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties (defined below), in whole or in part, from the Confidential Information (collectively, \u201cNotes\u201d); (ii) use the Confidential Information and Notes only for the purposes of evaluating a possible Transaction and the terms thereof; (iii) use the same degree of care as with its own confidential information, which shall be at least a reasonable standard of care, to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information and Notes, except to its Affiliates, and its or their officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, service providers, consultants and/or subcontractors (collectively, \u201cAuthorized Parties\u201d), solely to the extent necessary to permit them to assist the Receiving Party in evaluating the Transaction; and (iv) not disclose to persons (other than those described in clause (iii) above) that the Confidential Information has been made available, that the Receiving Party is considering a possible Transaction or that the parties have had or are having discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. The Receiving Party further agrees that prior to disclosing any Confidential Information to its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, as allowed hereunder, such Affiliates and/or Authorized Parties will be advised of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, provided a copy of this Agreement and directed to abide by its terms. The Receiving Party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by it, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties. Each party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity that a party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief or specific performance or both (although neither party shall be entitled to any special, consequential, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages as a result of a breach of this Agreement, whether a claim is asserted in contract, tort, or otherwise). Obligations in this Section 2 regarding Confidential Information shall, with respect to each disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder, continue for three (3) years from the date of each disclosure of Confidential Information. Nothing herein is intended to limit or abridge the protection of trade secrets under applicable trade secrets law, and trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.\n3. This Agreement shall be inoperative as to particular portions of the Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party if such information: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties; (ii) was available on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the Receiving Party; (iii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party when such source is not, to the best of the Receiving Party\u2019s knowledge, subject to a confidentiality obligation with the Disclosing Party; or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, without reference to the Confidential Information, and the Receiving Party can verify the development of such information by written documentation.\n4. If either party decides not to proceed with a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other party of that decision. In addition, the Disclosing Party may elect at any time by notice to the Receiving Party to terminate further access to and such party\u2019s review of the Confidential Information. In any such case or upon any other termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will immediately: (i) return all Confidential Information disclosed to it and (ii) destroy, with such destruction to be certified by the Receiving Party, all Notes, without retaining any copy thereof. No such termination of the Agreement or return or destruction of the Confidential Information or Notes will affect the confidentiality obligations of the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties, all of which will continue in effect as provided in this Agreement.\n5. Each party shall retain ownership of all Confidential Information and intellectual property it had prior to commencement of the discussions and evaluation referred to in this Agreement, but WAYNE FUELING SYSTEMS LLC shall own exclusively all rights in ideas, inventions, works of authorship, strategies, plans and data created in or resulting from discussions between WAYNE FUELING SYSTEMS LLC and the Company, including but not limited to all patent rights, copyrights, moral rights, rights in proprietary information, database rights, trademark rights and other intellectual property rights, and the Company will execute assignments as necessary to achieve that result. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant a license directly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, although the parties may provide for such a license in an express written agreement.\n6. If either party or any of their respective Affiliates or Authorized Parties is requested or required, by interrogatories, subpoena or similar legal process, to disclose any Confidential Information or Notes, such party agrees to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of each such request, to the extent practicable, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order, waive compliance by the Receiving Party with the provisions of this Agreement, or both. If, absent the entry of a protective order or receipt of a waiver, the Receiving Party is, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information or Notes, the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information or Notes to the persons and to the extent required without liability under this Agreement and will use its best efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information or Notes so disclosed.\n7. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and collateral communication, reports and understandings between the parties relating thereto. This Agreement is not intended as a teaming, joint venture or other such arrangement. No change, modification or addition to or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. Except as provided herein, the parties agree that any disclosures contemplated hereunder, and any discussions or communications between the parties relating thereto, shall not restrict either party\u2019s right to take whatever future actions such party unilaterally determines to be in its best interests, including the right to discontinue discussions with the other party at any time or to undertake similar discussions or to enter into agreements or relationships with third parties covering subjects related to the matters covered herein. All provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision or part thereof is deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then such term shall be construed to reflect the closest lawful interpretation of the parties\u2019 original intent, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid, enforceable and binding. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page of any such counterpart, or any facsimile transmission thereof, may be attached or appended to any other counterpart to complete a fully executed counterpart of this Agreement, and any facsimile transmission of any signature of a party shall be deemed an original and shall bind such party. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any loss, unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information and/or Notes or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties. In any such event, the Receiving Party shall help the Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to regain possession of the Confidential Information and/or Notes and shall prevent any further unauthorized disclosure or use. This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for the foregoing, neither party may assign this Agreement or any of their rights and obligations hereunder or delegate the performance thereof to a third party without the prior written consent of the other party. Except as stated herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any benefit to any third party or any right to enforce any term of this Agreement. Any failure by a party hereto to enforce the other party\u2019s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that party\u2019s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n8. WAYNE FUELING SYSTEMS LLC and Company each agrees to take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that the disclosure of Confidential Information complies with any export control laws which may govern such disclosure. The Receiving Party represents and warrants that no technical data it receives in conjunction with the Confidential Information that is subject to the export control laws of the United States of America (\u201cU.S.\u201d) shall be exported from the U.S. or re-exported from any other country without first complying with all export control laws and regulations of the U.S. Government, including without limitation the requirement for obtaining any export license, if applicable. The Receiving Party shall indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party harmless from all claims, demands, damages, costs, fines, penalties, attorney\u2019s fees and all other expenses arising from its, its Affiliates, or its or their Authorized Parties failure to comply with this clause and/or applicable export control laws and regulations.\n9. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules.\nThis Agreement shall commence on the date last

In the case of any permitted disclosure of Confidential Information under this paragraph (c), Valco and Brubaker shall inform such persons of the existence of this Agreement and take all reasonable steps to ensure that such persons comply with the provisions of this Agreement applicable to Valco and Brubaker.\n4. Enforcement; Damages; Construction\n(a) Valco's and Brubaker's obligations hereunder shall be joint and several as long as Brubaker controls Valco. If Brubaker no longer controls Valco, Valco's and Brubaker's obligation herein shall be several. Each of Valco and Brubaker recognizes that it would be impossible to measure in money all the damages which will accrue to CMC by reason of a failure to comply with the restrictions and perform the obligations under this Agreement. Each of Valco and Brubaker hereby acknowledges that CMC would lack an adequate remedy at law and CMC shall, in addition to and not in lieu of money damages, be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief against Valco and Brubaker in an action or procedure to enforce the provisions hereof. Valco and Brubaker shall reimburse CMC for its expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred in connection with the enforcement of the provisions hereof relating to a breach of this Agreement by Valco or Brubaker.\n(b) No waiver or amendment to this Agreement shall be valid unless signed in writing by each of Valco, Brubaker and CMC. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or as applied to any circumstance, under the laws of any jurisdiction which may govern for such purpose, then such provision shall be deemed to be modified or restricted to the extent and in a manner necessary to render the same valid and enforceable, either generally or as applied to such circumstance, or shall be deemed excised from this Agreement, as the case may require, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, as if such provision had been originally incorporated herein as so modified or restricted, or as if such provision had not been originally incorporated herein, as the case may be.\n(c) This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of each of Valco, Brubaker and CMC.\n(d) The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be construed to limit or define the scope or intent of any paragraph.\n(e) This Agreement has been executed and delivered in Colorado Springs, Colorado and the validity and interpretation hereof shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Colorado.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of Valco and Brubaker has executed this Agreement on the day and year first above written.\nVALCO INC.\nBy: ___________________________\nName: Thomas E.

"      NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT dated this 6th day of August, 2003 (this \""AGREEMENT\""), is made and entered into by and between HARRISON S. TRASK (\""PRINCIPAL\""), PHOENIX FOOTWEAR GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (\""PHOENIX FOOTWEAR\""), and its wholly-owned subsidiary PFG ACQUISITION, INC., a Montana corporation (\""PFG ACQUISITION\"").\nA. Phoenix Footwear, PFG Acquisition and H.S. Trask & Co., a Montana corporation (\""COMPANY\""), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 16, 2003 (the \""MERGER AGREEMENT\""), pursuant to which Company shall merge with and into Acquisition Sub and the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease.\nB. Principal is employed as President and Chief Executive Officer of Company and serves as a director of the Company.\nC. It is mutually agreed between Principal, Company and PFG Acquisition that Principal shall resign his employment as President and Chief Executive Officer of Company and as a director, said resignation to take effect as of the date that the Merger between Company and PFG Acquisition becomes effective (the \""MERGER EFFECTIVE DATE\"").\nD. It is also mutually agreed between Principal, Company and PFG Acquisition that Principal shall be employed as an employee of the surviving corporation to the Merger (\""SURVIVING CORPORATION\"") from the Merger Effective Date to December 31, 2003 and thereafter as a consultant until December 31, 2005. Principal and Surviving Corporation have accordingly entered into an Employment and Consulting Agreement dated August 6, 2003 (the \""EMPLOYMENT AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT\"").\nE. Principal owns approximately 38% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, and will receive considerable financial benefit when the Merger becomes effective.\nF. The Merger Agreement requires that Principal, Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition enter into this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows (unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Merger Agreement):\n1. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Agreement shall take effect on the Merger Effective Date.\n2. NON-COMPETITION. In order to induce Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition to enter into the Merger Agreement and to pay the valuable consideration required thereunder, to create a valuable independent asset of PFG Acquisition, to preserve and protect the goodwill thereof, and to enhance the going concern value and earnings of PFG Acquisition in future years, Principal undertakes and agrees as follows:\n(a) Commencing on the effective date hereof and continuing thereafter until December 31, 2005 (the \""RESTRICTION PERIOD\""), Principal shall not, within the United States (the \""TERRITORY\""), create, seek or accept employment or compensation of any kind or character from any enterprise, or person associated with any enterprise that is engaged or planning to engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture, sale, marketing, promotion or sale of products in the brown shoe market segment of the men's footwear business (a \""COMPETING ENTERPRISE\""); provided, however, that Principal may accept employment as a salesman or as a sales representative with any such Competing Enterprise without violating the foregoing.\n(b) During the Term, neither Principal nor any entity in which Principal may be interested (as a principal, owner, partner, joint venturer, trustee, director, officer, shareholder, option holder, security holder, lender, creditor, guarantor, advisor, member or in any other capacity other than solely as a salesman or as a sales representative) shall, within the Territory, engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity that, directly or indirectly, manufactures, markets, promotes or engages in the sale of products in the brown shoe market segment of the men's footwear business; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prevent Principal from investing in securities if (i) such class of securities in which the investment so made is listed on a national securities exchange or is issued by a company registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, so long as such investment holdings do not, in the aggregate, constitute more than five percent (5%) of the voting power of the entity issuing such securities; and (ii) any other securities so long as such investment holdings do not constitute more than two percent (2%) of the voting power of the entity issuing such securities.\n(c) During the Term, without the Company's written consent, Principal shall not, either in his individual capacity or as an agent for another: (i) hire or offer to hire any of Company's, Phoenix Footwear's or PFG Acquisition's officers, employees, or agents; (ii) entice away or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade any of Company's, Phoenix Footwear's or PFG Acquisition's officers, employees, or agents to discontinue their relationship with Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition; (iii) contract, solicit, divert, or attempt to divert from Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition any business whatsoever by influencing or attempting to influence any customer of Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition with whom Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition has engaged in sales discussions prior to the termination of this Agreement; or (iv) contract, solicit, divert, or attempt to divert from Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition any supplier or vendor.\n(d) The covenants set forth in this Section 2 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants covering their subject matter in each of the separate states within the Territory and, except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant set forth above in this Section 2. To the extent that any such covenant shall be judicially unenforceable in any one or more of such states, such covenant shall not be affected with respect to each of the other states in the Territory. Each covenant with respect to each such state in the Territory shall be construed as severable and independent.\n(e) Phoenix Footwear, PGG Acquisition and Principal acknowledge and recognize that these covenants not to compete are integral to the Merger Agreement, that without the protection of such covenants, Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition would not have entered into the Merger Agreement, that the consideration paid by Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition under the Merger Agreement bears no relationship to the damages Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition may suffer in the event of any breach of the covenants, and that such covenants contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained necessary to protect Phoenix Footwear's and PFG Acquisition's business interests. If this Section 2 shall for any reason be held excessively broad as to time, duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be enforceable to the extent compatible with then-applicable laws.\n3. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that:\n(i) The Company assets being merged into PFG Acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement include confidential and proprietary information of Company and, in the course of his employment for PFT Acquisition, Principal may develop and obtain access to confidential and proprietary information of Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition (collectively, the \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\""), which Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, all of the following materials and information of Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition (whether or not reduced to writing and whether or not patentable or protected by copyright): trade secrets, product specifications, proprietary software systems, sources of data, databases, know-how, formulae, inventions and ideas, designs, sketches, photographs, graphs, drawings, samples, selling and pricing information, procedures, research methodologies, customer lists, business and marketing plans, current and anticipated customer requirements, market studies, supplier lists, operational methods, product development plans and personnel plans. The parties hereto agree that the failure of any Confidential Information to be marked or otherwise labeled as confidential or proprietary information shall not affect its status as Confidential Information.\n(ii) The Confidential Information is confidential and proprietary, and the development and protection of the Confidential Information represents a substantial investment having a great economic and commercial value to Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition.\n(iii) Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition would be irreparably damaged if any of the Confidential Information was disclosed to, or used or exploited on behalf of, any person other than Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition.\n(b) Principal covenants and agrees that he shall not, at any time, during the Restrictions Period, directly or indirectly, use, exploit, or disclose to any person or entity, without the prior written consent of Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition, any Confidential Information, except as expressly authorized by Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition during the performance of Principal's duties for and with PFG Acquisition.\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Principal may use, exploit, or disclose Confidential Information, but only to the extent that such Confidential Information (i) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of Principal; or (ii) is disclosed pursuant to the requirement of a governmental agency or a court of law or otherwise required by operation of law, provided that Principal gives PFG Acquisition and Phoenix Footwear prompt written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure.\n4. REASONABLENESS OF RESTRICTIONS. PRINCIPAL HAS CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDERED THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 2 AND 3 HEREOF AND, HAVING DONE SO, HEREBY AGREES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SUCH SECTIONS ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE AND ARE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF PHOENIX FOOTWEAR AND PFG Acquisition.\n5. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n(a) Principal acknowledges and agrees that Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition will suffer irreparable harm in the event that Principal breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement, and that monetary damages shall be inadequate to compensate Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition for any such breach. Principal agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Principal of the provisions of this Agreement, Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition, or either of them, shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction in order to prevent or restrain any such breach or threatened breach by Principal, or by any or all of Principal's agents, representatives or other persons directly or indirectly acting for, on behalf of, or with Principal.\n(b) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in Section 5(a) above, or any other provision contained in this Agreement, the parties hereby agree that no remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of this Agreement, including without limitation, this Section 5, is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.\n6.

"      MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement is entered into effective as of the 15 day of October, 1999 by and between SER Systeme AG, a German corporation (\""SER\"") and EIS International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\""EIS\"").\nWHEREAS, in order to enable the parties to evaluate the merits of a possible business transaction between them (the \""Transaction\""), each party may furnish to the other certain information.\nNOW, THEREFORE, to induce EIS and SER to disclose such information, the parties agree as follows:\n1. Each party agrees that all information disclosed by a party (the \""Disclosing Party\""), including without limitation information acquired by the other party (the \""Receiving Party\"") from Disclosing Party's employees or upon inspection of Disclosing Party's property, relating (without limitation) to Disclosing Party's products, designs, business opportunities, plans (business, marketing or otherwise), strategies, budgets, finance, customer lists, contracts, research and development, software programs, trade secrets, know-how, techniques, inventions, processes, distribution methods, schematics and personnel disclosed to Disclosing Party by third parties, shall be considered \""Confidential Information\"".\n2. Confidential Information shall not include information which recipient is able to prove by documentary evidence (a) is now or subsequently becomes generally known or available by publication, commercial or otherwise, through no fault of the Receiving Party, (b) was known by the recipient at the time of the disclosure or was independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information, or (c) must be disclosed pursuant to applicable legal disclosure requirements or legal process. Confidential Information shall also not include information that the parties agree in writing may be disclosed by Receiving Party.\n3. The Receiving Party expressly agrees not to use the Confidential Information for purposes other than those necessary to consider whether to enter into a Transaction and shall strictly limit its disclosure to such of its employees, directors and advisors having a need to know such information, which parties shall be advised that such information is Confidential Information and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Except as set forth herein, the Receiving Party shall hold all information received in confidence and not sell, assign, transfer, release or otherwise disclose the Confidential Information, or material derived therefrom, to any third party, or to its other employees, officers, directors, shareholders, agents or consultants. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information for purposes of competing with the Disclosing Party.\n4. Except as must be disclosed pursuant to applicable legal disclosure requirements or legal process, neither party nor any of its respective representatives may, without the prior written consent of the other party, disclose to any person (other than to its employees, directors and advisors having a need to know such information) that the parties have exchanged confidential information, are engaged in negotiations for a Transaction, or the proposed terms of a Transaction (collectively, the \""Negotiations\"") until such information has been disclosed by an appropriate legal filing and/or press release mutually agreed upon by SER and EIS. Each party shall undertake all necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that the Negotiations remain secret and confidential.\n5. In the event that the Receiving Party or anyone to whom the Receiving Party transmits the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement becomes legally compelled to disclose all or any portion of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information or to disclose the existence of Negotiations, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice thereof, so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party or the recipient of such Disclosing Party's Confidential Information will furnish only that portion of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information or aspect of the Negotiations which is legally required to be disclosed and the Receiving Party, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, will exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded such portion of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.\n6. The Receiving Party shall immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information or the Negotiations, and shall provide a detailed description of the circumstances of the disclosure and the parties involved, and shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts to limit or respond to such disclosure.\n7. The Receiving Party agrees that all Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and no license or other rights in the Confidential Information is granted hereby. The Receiving Party will not disclose the existence, content and/or substance of any of the Confidential Information to any third party; nor develop, manufacture, produce and/or distribute any software product(s) derived from or which otherwise use any of the Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party agrees to return (and have any third party to who it supplied the Confidential Information return) to the Receiving Party, immediately upon notification by the Disclosing Party in writing, all Confidential Information, including but not limited to all computer programs, documentation, notes, plans, drawings, and copies or reproductions thereof, in any form or medium whatsoever, and not to retain any copies thereof.\n8. The Receiving Party will, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, refrain from disassembling or decompiling software, or otherwise attempting to reverse engineer the design and function of any of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will not remove any copyright notice, trademark notice and/or other proprietary legend or indication of confidentiality set forth on or contained in any of the Confidential Information.\n9. The parties agree that any product, plan, strategy or other thing or concept jointly developed as a result of, or during, the Negotiations, shall be the joint property of both parties hereto. Neither party shall use, license or otherwise exploit such jointly developed item(s) without the express prior written consent of the other party hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the above, any product, plan, strategy or other thing or concept that a party can prove was known by the recipient at the time of the development with the other party or was independently developed shall not be considered a jointly developed item(s).\n10. Each party hereby acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information or the Negotiations could cause irreparable harm and significant injury, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, each party agrees that each party shall have the right to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief from breaches of this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies each party may have.\n11. Although the Disclosing Party shall endeavor to provide the other party with information relevant for an evaluation of a Transaction, the Disclosing Party and its advisors have not made, and will not make, any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information being provided. Any and all such representations and warranties shall be only as specifically set forth in a definitive agreement, if one is hereafter executed and delivered in connection with a Transaction.\n12. Without the written consent of the other party, neither party nor its affiliates shall not solicit for employment, nor shall it employ or retain or enter into any contract for the provision of personal services during the two (2) year period commencing on the date hereof any person who is employed by the other party as of the date hereof.\n13. The Receiving Party agrees to indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party harmless from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including, without limitation, reasonable fees for attorneys, expert witnesses and court costs) which result from a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.\n14. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding its choice of law rules, and the courts of Fairfax County (if under State law) or the Eastern District of Virginia (if under Federal law) shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such actions; (b) the prevailing party, as determined by the court, in any action between the parties arising from this Agreement shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any other relief awarded, its costs and expenses incurred in any such proceeding, including reasonable fees for attorneys, expert witnesses and court costs; (c) the Receiving Party's rights under this Agreement may not be assigned to any third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent and any attempted or purported assignment of this Agreement without such party's consent shall be void; and (d) this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, discussions and understandings of the parties.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the day and year first written above.\nSER SYSTEME AG EIS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nBy: /s/ DR.

"      MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT is entered into and made effective as of February 10, 2000, by and between New England Business Service, Inc. (\""NEBS\"") and Premium Wear, Inc. (\""Premium Wear\""). This Agreement provides for the protection from unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information (as defined below) that may be furnished by one of the parties hereto to the other party and that may be used by the receiving party solely for the purpose of evaluating or engaging in a business relationship between the disclosing party and the receiving party.\n1. \""Confidential Information\"" means non-public information relating to the disclosing party's business that the disclosing party designates as being confidential or proprietary or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential. \""Confidential Information\"" includes, without limitation, ideas, concepts, designs, specifications, drawings, blueprints, tracings, models, samples, data, computer programs, marketing plans and strategies, business strategies, customer names, mailing lists, prices, rates, costs, information received from others that the disclosing party is obligated to treat as confidential, and other technical, financial or business information. Confidential Information may be furnished in any tangible or intangible form, including written or printed documents, visual demonstrations or inspections, computer disks or tapes, other electronic media and oral communications.\nThe receiving party's obligations hereunder will not apply, or will cease to apply, to that Confidential Information which the receiving party can establish (i) is or hereafter becomes generally known or available to the public or interested persons through no breach of this Agreement by the receiving party; (ii) is rightfully known to the receiving party without restriction on disclosure at the time of its receipt from the disclosing party; (iii) is rightfully furnished to the receiving party by a third party without breach of an obligation of confidentiality; (iv) is disclosed to a third party by the disclosing party without similar restrictions on such third party's rights; (v) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information; (vi) is required to be disclosed pursuant to the order of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body (provided that the receiving party shall give the disclosing party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure and shall comply with any applicable protective order or equivalent); or (vii) is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing party.\n2. Obligations of Receiving Party. The receiving party will protect Confidential Information by using at least the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of such Confidential Information as the receiving party uses to protect its own confidential or proprietary information. The receiving party will neither disclose nor copy Confidential Disclosure except as necessary for its employees, agents or representatives with a need to know, provided that any such employee, agent or representative shall have agreed in writing, as a condition to his or her employment or engagement or in order to obtain Confidential Information, to be bound by non-disclosure and non-use obligations substantially similar to this Agreement. Any copies which are made will be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and shall be reproduced with the disclosing party's proprietary rights notices in the same manner in which such notices appear in the original copy provided by the disclosing party. The receiving party will not use the Confidential Information for any purpose except to evaluate a business relationship with the disclosing party or otherwise in pursuance of such a relationship. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to limit the receiving party's right to independently develop information similar to the Confidential Information or to compete with the disclosing party so long as the receiving party does not violate its obligations hereunder regarding the non-disclosure and use of the Confidential Information.\n3. Ownership of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing party. By disclosing information to the receiving party, the disclosing party does not grant any express or implied right to the receiving party to or under any of the disclosing party's patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secret information. The receiving party will return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information immediately upon the disclosing party's request or, at the disclosing party's option, destroy the same, and will deliver to the disclosing party, upon its request, a certificate of a duly authorized officer certifying as to the foregoing.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. The parties agree not to disclose the existence of this Agreement and the fact that they are engaged in discussions unless required to do so by applicable securities laws as reasonably determined by their respective legal counsel. If such disclosure is necessary, the parties agree to notify each other as soon as possible in advance of such disclosure and agree to provide a copy of such disclosure to the other party.\n5. Standstill. NEBS agrees not to buy Premium Wear's common shares without the written consent of the Board of Directors of Premium Wear prior to March 1, 2002.\n6. Remedies. The receiving party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the disclosing party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the disclosing party.\n7. No Warranty. THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, ASSURANCE, GUARANTY OR INDUCEMENT WHATSOEVER TO THE RECEIVING PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF ANY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, OR ANY OTHER MATTER OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER. THE DISCLOSING PARTY ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY EXPENSES, LOSSES OR ACTIONS INCURRED OR UNDERTAKEN BY THE RECEIVING PARTY AS A RESULT OF RECEIPT OF ANY INFORMATION FROM THE DISCLOSING PARTY. This Agreement does not require any party to furnish any information to another party. It is further understood that neither party has any obligation under or by virtue of this Agreement to enter into any type of business relationship with the other party.\n8. Term. The obligations of each receiving party hereunder with respect to the non-disclosure and use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information shall survive until such time as all such Confidential Information disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving party.\n9. General. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, concerning the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended, modified or revoked only by a written instrument executed by all parties hereto. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any term hereof, and no waiver of a provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota. Each party consents to personal jurisdiction in any action brought in any court, federal or state, of competent jurisdiction within the State of Minnesota. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\nPREMIUM WEAR, INC.

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement (\""AGREEMENT\"") is entered into as of July 15, 2002, by and between Swiss Army Brands, Inc. a Delaware corporation (\""SABI\"") and Victorinox A.G., a Swiss corporation (\""VICTORINOX\"").\nWHEREAS, Victorinox is the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of SABI's capital stock and is also SABI's principal supplier;\nWHEREAS, on June 12, 2002, Victorinox made a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of SABI not owned by Victorinox or its affiliates (\""Proposal\"");\nWHEREAS, in connection with this Proposal, and from time to time in the course of SABI's business relationship with Victorinox, SABI will disclose nonpublic information to Victorinox; and\nWHEREAS, Victorinox has previously orally agreed to preserve and protect the confidentiality of such information;\nNOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and in order to confirm and set forth in more detail their prior verbal agreement with respect to such matters, the parties agree as follows:\n1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\"" means any and all information and material disclosed by SABI to Victorinox (before or after the signing of this Agreement, and whether orally or in writing, graphic, electronic or any other form) that is marked or described as, identified orally or in writing as, or provided under circumstances indicating it is, confidential, proprietary or not otherwise available to the general public at the time of such disclosure.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE AND LIMITED USE.\nVictorinox shall hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party. Victorinox shall disclose the Confidential Information only to its employees and agents who need to know such information and who are bound by restrictions regarding disclosure and use of such information comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth herein. Victorinox shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the unauthorized use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 2 with respect to any item of Confidential Information shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n3. SCOPE.\nThe obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall not apply with respect to any Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is\nor becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the Victorinox, or to the extent that disclosure of such Confidential Information is required by law.\n4. REMEDIES.\nVictorinox agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information will cause irreparable harm and significant injury to SABI, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Victorinox agrees that SABI, in addition to any other available remedies, shall have the right to an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting any bond or other security.\n5. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS.\nVictorinox hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and it will advise its employees and agents to whom it discloses Confidential Information, that the United States securities laws generally prohibit persons who receive from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n6. MISCELLANEOUS.\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized signatories of both parties. The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of or default under the same or any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver of any right or remedy. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n<PAGE>\nVICTORINOX A.G.

Such disclosure shall be made to the \""Receiving Party\"" prior to any contractual agreement or receipt of Proprietary Information.\n3. Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party shall be treated and safeguarded hereunder by the Receiving Party for a period of two (2) years from the date of disclosure. The Receiving Party warrants that it applies reasonable safeguards against the unauthorized disclosure of Proprietary Information and that it will protect such Proprietary Information as least as securely as it protects its own Proprietary Information.\n4.

This Agreement shall terminate two (2) years from the date first written above, except the obligations of confidentiality pursuant to paragraph 3, and the terms of paragraph 4, shall continue for the period specified in paragraph 3.\n7.

"      EXHIBIT 10.6\nNON-COMPETITION, NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT\nTHIS NON-COMPETITION, NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (\""Agreement\""), dated this 2nd day of August 2005 (the \""Effective Date\""), by and between John Ermilio (\""Ermilio\"") and National Investment Managers Inc., a Florida corporation (the \""Purchaser\"").\nRECITALS\nA. Pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated August 2, 2005, by and among Haddon Strategic Alliances, Inc., John Ermilio and the Purchaser (collectively, the \""Purchase Agreement\""), the Purchaser is acquiring 100% of the Companies' issued and outstanding common stock, including Ermilio's controlling interest therein. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.\nB. Ermilio has been a principal shareholder of the Company for many years and has developed and received special, unique and extraordinary knowledge, information and goodwill in connection therewith.\nC. It is a condition precedent to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and an inducement to the Purchaser to enter into the Purchase Agreement and effect the purchase of the Company and its businesses thereunder and the goodwill represented thereby, that the parties hereto execute and deliver this Agreement.\nD. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreements.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. Commencing on the date hereof and ending on the last day of the Restricted Period (as defined below), Ermilio covenants and agrees that he will not, without the Purchaser's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, either on behalf of himself or on behalf of any business venture, as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, stockholder, officer, director, trustee, agent, or otherwise (other than on behalf of the Purchaser or its Affiliates):\n(A) be employed by, engage or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or act in any advisory, expert, consulting or other capacity for, any entity or individual that competes with the Purchaser or its Affiliates in the areas of pension administration, insurance product sales, investment advisory services and other retirement products, in the following territory: in Pennsylvania - the counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia; and in New Jersey - the counties of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer and Salem;\n(B) solicit or divert any business or any customer from the Purchaser or its Affiliates or assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so or attempting to do so;\n(C) cause or seek to cause any person, firm or corporation to refrain from dealing or doing business with the Purchaser or its Affiliates or assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so; or\n(D) hire, solicit or divert from the Purchaser or its Affiliates any of their respective employees, consultants or agents who have, at any time during the immediately preceding one (1) year period from the date hereof or the Restricted Period, been engaged by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, nor assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Affiliates\"" shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under the common control of the Purchaser. For the purpose of this Agreement, \""control\"" shall mean the direct or indirect ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of an entity or possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of management and policies of an entity.\nAs used in this Agreement, \""Restricted Period\"" means the period commencing on the date hereof and ending as follows: If the Purchaser or SHRA does not offer Ermilio an extension (\""Extension\"") of his employment agreement, of even date herewith, with SHRA beyond the expiration date of the original one-year term (\""Expiration Date\""), then the Restricted Period shall be one (1) year from the date hereof. If the Purchaser or SHRA offers Ermilio an Extension, then the Restricted Period shall extend until the later of (i) two (2) years from the date hereof and (ii) one (1) year from the date of his termination of employment with the SHRA, or any Affiliate of SHRA, for any reason.\n2 Nondisclosure. Ermilio understands and agrees that the business of the Purchaser and its Affiliates is based upon specialized work and Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined). Ermilio agrees that during the Restricted Period, he shall keep secret all such Confidential Information and that he will not, directly or indirectly, use for his own benefit or for the benefit of others nor Disclose (as hereinafter defined), without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, any Confidential Information. At any time upon the Purchaser's request, Ermilio shall turn over to the Purchaser all books, notes, memoranda, manuals, notebooks, records and other documents made, compiled by, delivered to, or in the possession or control of Ermilio containing or concerning any Confidential Information, including all copies thereof, in any form or format, including any computer hard disks, wherever located, containing any such information, it being agreed that the same and all information contained therein are at all times the exclusive property of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Confidential Information\"" means any information or compilation of information not generally known to the public or the industry, that is proprietary or confidential to the Purchaser, its Affiliates and/or those doing business with the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, including but not limited to know-how, process, techniques, methods, plans, specifications, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, supplier lists, customer lists, mailing lists, financial information, business plans and/or policies, methods of operation, sales and marketing plans and any other information acquired or developed by Ermilio in the course of his past, present and future dealings with the Purchaser and its Affiliates, which is not readily available to the public.\n\""Confidential Information\"" does not include any information, datum or fact: (a) currently available to the public as of the date hereof; (b) after it becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach hereof or other wrongful conduct by Executive; (c) after it becomes available to Executive on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company or its Affiliates or a person or entity breaching his or its confidentiality agreement or other relationship of confidence with the Company or its Affiliates; or (d) developed independently by Executive without any reference to or use whatsoever of any Confidential Information of the Company or its Affiliates.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Disclose\"" means to reveal, deliver, divulge, disclose, publish, copy, communicate, show, allow or permit access to, or otherwise make known or available to any third party, any of the Confidential Information.\n3 Blue Pencil Doctrine. In the event that the restrictive covenants contained in Section 1 and/or Section 2 of this Agreement shall be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable by reason of such restrictive covenants extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographic area or by reason of such restrictive covenants being too extensive in any other respect, then such restrictive covenant shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such restrictive covenant reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances.\n4 Injunctive Relief. If Ermilio shall breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of Section 1 and/or Section 2, in addition to and without limiting any other remedies available to the Purchaser at law or in equity, the Purchaser shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in any court to restrain any such breach or threatened breach and to enforce the provisions of Section 1 and/or Section 2, as the case may be. Ermilio acknowledges and agrees that there is no adequate remedy at law for any such breach or threatened breach and, in the event that any proceeding is brought seeking injunctive relief, Ermilio shall not use as a defense thereto that there is an adequate remedy at law.\n5 Reasonableness of Covenants. Ermilio acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are a necessary inducement to Purchaser purchasing Ermilio's ownership interests in the Companies, and that the scope (geographic and otherwise) and period of duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are both fair and reasonable and that the interests sought to be protected by the Purchaser are legitimate business interests entitled to be protected. Ermilio further acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser would not have purchased Ermilio's ownership interests in the Companies pursuant to the Purchase Agreement unless Ermilio entered into this Agreement.\n6 General Provisions.\n(A) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Purchase Agreements and any other agreements contemplated thereby, contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings, oral or written, among the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.\n(B) Amendment; Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all of the parties and then such waiver shall only be effective in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.\n(C) Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreements.\n(D) Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, personal representative(s), successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement may be assigned to, and thereupon shall inure to the benefit of, any organization which succeeds to substantially all of the business or assets of the Purchaser, whether by means of merger, consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Purchaser or otherwise, including, without limitation, by operation of law.\n(E) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in that state, without regard to any of its principles of conflicts of laws or other laws that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted without regard to any presumption against the party causing this Agreement to be drafted. Each of the parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives the right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the parties unconditionally and irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the County of New York and the Federal district court for the Southern District of New York located in the County of New York with respect to any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and each of the parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any objection to venue in any such court.\n(F) Recovery of Attorneys' Fees and Costs. If any action for breach of or to enforce the provisions of this Agreement is commenced, the court in such action shall award to the party in whose favor a judgment is entered, a reasonable sum as attorneys' fees and costs. Such attorneys' fees and costs shall be paid by the non-prevailing party in such action.\n(G) Headings. The headings to the paragraphs of this Agreement are intended for the convenience of the parties only and shall in no way be held to explain, modify, amplify or aid in the interpretation of the provisions hereof.\n(H) Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and if any portion hereof shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder shall not thereby be invalidated but shall remain in full force and effect.\n(I) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.\nNATIONAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS INC.\nBy: __________________________\nName:\nTitle:\n-------------------------------\nJOHN

"      August 7, 1997\nMs. Donna M. Hitscherich\nVice President\nJ.P. Morgan Securities Inc.\n60 Wall Street\nNew York, New York 10260\nDear Ms. Hitscherich:\nCarpenter Technology Corporation (\""we\"", \""our\"" or \""us\"") has requested information regarding Talley Industries, Inc. (the \""Company\"", \""your\"" or \""you\"") in connection with our consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a \""Possible Transaction\""). In consideration of your furnishing us with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) we agree as follows:\nConfidentiality of Evaluation Materials\nWe will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either the Company or its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated (\""JPM\""), or the Company's other representatives furnish to us in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by us, or by our representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or our review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the \""Evaluation Materials\""). We recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \""Evaluation Materials\"" includes information furnished to us orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \""confidential\"". The term \""Evaluation Materials\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by us or our representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to us on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to us by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by us.\nUse of Evaluation Materials\nWe will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. We and our representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may be disclosed to those of our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \""our representatives\"") who we reasonably determine need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between us and the Company (it being understood that our representatives shall be informed by us of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by us, and shall each agree to treat such information confidentially) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither we nor our representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. We will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by our representatives. In the event that we or any of our representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, we or our representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) we or our representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which we are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise our best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) we shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by us or our representatives not permitted by this Agreement. Non-Disclosure\nThe disclosure of our possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, we agree that prior to the execution of a Sale Agreement with respect to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, we will not, and we will direct our representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between us and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof unless we are advised by counsel that we are required to make such disclosure. The term \""person\"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.\nReturn of Documents\nUpon the Company's request, we shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials.\nNo Unauthorized Contact\nDuring the course of our evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to JPM or employees or representatives of the Company specified by JPM. Accordingly, we agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express consent of JPM, with the exception of direct communication between our chairman and the Company's chairman. We also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by us and such third party without JPM's prior written consent provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not prevent us from soliciting, on a confidential basis, indications of intent from selected third parties for the purchase of portions of the Company.\nFor a period of two years following the date hereof, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions with whom you have had contact or who became known to you in connection with your consideration of the Possible Transaction, except that you shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (i) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you, (ii) responds to any public advertisement placed by you, or (iii) has been terminated by the Company or its subsidiaries prior to commencement of employment discussions between you and such officer, director, or employee.\nStandstill\nWe agree that until two years from the date of this Agreement, we will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a \""group\"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger.\nNo Representation or Warranty\nAlthough the Company and JPM have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of our investigation, we acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied hereunder, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to us or any other person hereunder resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by us or any of our representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (\""Sale Agreement\"") when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.\nWe also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between us and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, and we hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto. We also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and us with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \""Sale Agreement\"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by us.\nNo Solicitation\nDuring the period from acceptance of this agreement until the earlier of (a): the execution of a definitive agreement or (b) the date that is 45 days after the date of such acceptance, the Company and the officers, directors, employees and other representatives of the Company including JPM shall not directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage any offers or proposals for the acquisition of the Company, or of any of the capital stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, from third parties (an \""Acquisition Proposal\""). The Company may, however, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide confidential information to, a third party, if the Chairman of the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice from the Company's financial advisor, that such third party has submitted a bona fide proposal or indication of interest that is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal that is financially superior to the non-binding indication of interest contained in the letter of August 7, 1997 from Robert W. Cardy to Paul L. Foster; provided, however, that the Company agrees to inform us of the receipt of any such proposal.\nLegal Remedy\nWe understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.\nOther\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.\nVery truly yours,\nCARPENTER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ G.

"      Agreement No.________\nNon-Disclosure Agreement\nThis Agreement is made between CELERITY SYSTEMS, INC., (\""CELERITY\"") and UNISYS Corporation - Federal Systems Division. (\""UNISYS\"") and concerns the handling, safeguarding and exchange of sensitive, proprietary or confidential information (collectively \""Proprietary Information\""). It is agreed and understood that any exchange of such Proprietary Information is expressly for the sole purpose of CELERITY and UNISYS evaluating a possible business arrangement involving an existing UNISYS contract with a federal government agency.\n1. For the purposes hereof, Proprietary Information shall be any documents, materials or information that (i) is in tangible form and clearly marked as being proprietary, confidential or sensitive and (ii) is received by one party to this Agreement (\""Recipient\"") from the other party to this Agreement (\""Transmitter\"").\n2. The Recipient agrees to safeguard, protect and handle all Proprietary Information made available under this Agreement with the same degree of care and procedures as Recipient applies to its own confidential or proprietary information. Without the written consent of the Transmitter, the Recipient of Proprietary Information agrees (i) not to disclose, disseminate, reproduce or otherwise distribute such information and materials to any third party, except a governmental judicial authority's issued order and (ii) not to use such information for any other purposes beyond that expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n3. All Proprietary Information disclosed under this Agreement shall remain the property of the Transmitter. It is agreed that the Recipient does not obtain any title or license rights to the Proprietary Information furnished under this Agreement.\n4. All Proprietary Information exchanged under this Agreement shall be returned or destroyed in accordance with written instructions upon the earlier of a written request from the Transmitter or termination of this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement, at any time, by providing written notice to the receiving party. Termination of this Agreement shall not be construed as relieving the Recipient of its obligations to safeguard, protect and dispose of the Proprietary Information as set forth in this Agreement.\n5. The Recipient's obligations to protect, safeguard and handle Proprietary Information received hereunder shall not be binding if such Proprietary Information (i) is in the public domain through no fault of the Recipient, (ii) is known to the Recipient prior to disclosure hereunder, (iii) is lawfully disclosed to Recipient by a third party. The Recipient's obligations shall survive until the Proprietary Information has been returned, destroyed in accordance with written instructions or covered by a subsequent agreement between CELERITY and UNISYS for the contemplated services.\nThis represents the entire agreement of the parties relative to the subject matter and shall be governed and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\nAccepted by:\nUNISYS Corporation CELERITY SYSTEMS, INC.\nBy: /s/ Dennis A.

At any time upon NIM's request, Seller shall turn over to NIM all books, notes, memoranda, manuals, notebooks, records and other documents made, compiled by, delivered to, or in the possession or control of Seller containing or concerning any Confidential Information, including all copies thereof, in any form or format, including any computer hard disks containing Confidential Information, wherever located, containing any such information, it being agreed that the same and all information contained therein are at all times the exclusive property of NIM and its Affiliates; provided, however, in the event that computer hard disks contain Confidential Information as well as information confidential to the Seller, then Seller shall make copies of all Confidential Information on such computer hard disks and return such copies to NIM and delete the Confidential Information from such computer hard disks.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Confidential Information\"" means any information or compilation of information not generally known to the public or the industry, that is proprietary or confidential to NIM, its Affiliates and/or those doing business with NIM and/or its Affiliates, including but not limited to know-how, process, techniques, methods, plans, specifications, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, supplier lists, customer lists, mailing lists, financial information, business plans and/or policies, methods of operation, sales and marketing plans and any other information acquired or developed by Seller in the course of his past, present and future dealings with NIM and its Affiliates, which is not available to the public.\n\""Confidential Information\"" does not include any information, datum or fact: (a) currently available to the public as of the date hereof; (b) after it becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach hereof or other wrongful conduct by Executive; (c) after it becomes available to Executive on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than NIM or its Affiliates or a person or entity breaching his or its confidentiality agreement or other relationship of confidence with NIM or its Affiliates; or (d) developed independently by Seller without any reference to or use whatsoever of any Confidential Information of NIM or its Affiliates.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Disclose\"" means to reveal, deliver, divulge, disclose, publish, copy, communicate, show, allow or permit access to, or otherwise make known or available to any third party, any of the Confidential Information.\n3 Covenants of NIM. NIM, for itself and its affiliates, hereby covenants and agrees that it and they will not, during the Restricted Period hire, solicit or divert from Lamco Advisory Services, Inc., an affiliate of Seller (\""Advisory\""), any of its respective employees, consultants or agents who have, at any time during the immediately preceding one (1) year period from the date hereof or during the Restricted Period, been engaged by Advisory, nor assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so.\n4 Blue Pencil Doctrine. In the event that the restrictive covenants contained in Sections 1, 2 and/or 3 of this Agreement shall be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable by reason of such restrictive covenants extending for too great a period of time or over too great a geographic area or by reason of such restrictive covenants being too extensive in any other respect, then such restrictive covenant shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such restrictive covenant reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances.\n5 Injunctive Relief. If any party shall breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of Sections 1, 2 and/or 3 hereof, in addition to and without limiting any other remedies available at law or in equity, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction to restrain any such breach or threatened breach and to enforce the provisions of Section 1, 2 and/or 3, as the case may be. The parties acknowledge and agree that there is no adequate remedy at law for any such breach or threatened breach and, in the event that any proceeding is brought seeking injunctive relief, the breaching party shall not use as a defense thereto that there is an adequate remedy at law.\n6 Reasonableness of Covenants. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are a necessary inducement to Purchaser purchasing Seller's ownership interests in NIM and its subsidiaries, and that the scope (geographic and otherwise) and period of duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are both fair and reasonable and that the interests sought to be protected by NIM are legitimate business interests entitled to be protected. Seller further acknowledges and agrees that NIM would not have purchased Seller's ownership interests in the Companies pursuant to the Purchase Agreement unless Seller entered into this Agreement. NIM acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 3 hereof are a necessary inducement to Seller entering into the Purchase Agreement and other agreements executed in connection therewith, and are fair and reasonable in scope and duration, and that the interests sought to be protected by Seller are legitimate business interests entitled to protection.\n7 General Provisions.\n(A) Entire Agreement.

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the \""AGREEMENT\"") is entered into as of May 5, 2000 by and between Cangene Corporation (\""BUYER\"") and CHESAPEAKE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORIES, INC. (\""CBL\""). (Buyer and CBL are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \""PARTY\"" and collectively as the \""PARTIES;\"" each Party as a provider/discloser of Confidential Information (as defined below) is referred to herein as \""PROVIDER;\"" and each Party as a reviewer/recipient of Confidential Information is referred to herein as a \""REVIEWER\"").\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the Parties desire to review Confidential Information relating to each other for the sole purpose of determining whether the Parties desire to engage in a business combination or other strategic relationship (the \""TRANSACTION\""); and\nWHEREAS, as a condition to either Party providing any Confidential Information to the other Party, the Parties have agreed to execute and deliver this Agreement to protect each other prior to gaining access to any Confidential Information.\nNOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information\n(a) Subject to 1(b) below, the term \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\"" means and includes all information and materials relating to either Party, including, without limitation, all books, records, financial statements, by-laws, operating agreements and/or other organizational documents, capital structure information, ownership information, business plans, pricing information, employee information, marketing plans and procedures, strategies, forecasts, customer lists, supplier lists, product development plans, trade secrets, documents, files, data, notes, analyses, compilations, studies, specifications, technology, computer programs, designs, and other information, materials and rights of every nature whatsoever whether prepared or created by the Provider, the Reviewer or otherwise, together with such other information, data or materials, if any, already provided to the Reviewer or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of the Provider, directly or indirectly, in each case whether oral or written, whether or not confidential or proprietary status is indicated orally or in writing or in a context in which the Provider or its representatives reasonable communicated, or the Reviewer or its Representatives should reasonably have understood, that the information should be treated as confidential, whether or not the specific words \""confidential\"" or \""proprietary\"" are used, and all portions of all compilations, studies, notes, analyses and memoranda prepared in connection therewith or derived therefrom that contain or reflect such information, and all copies thereof. The fact that Confidential Information has been or will be exchanged pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and that discussions are occuring with respect to the purposes hereof (and the status of such discussions) also shall be treated as \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\"" under this Agreement.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the following types of information and materials shall not constitute \""Confidential Information\"" for purposes of this Agreement and neither Party shall have any obligations to the other Party hereunder with respect to any information or materials if, when or to the extent that such information or materials: (i) is or becomes generally available in the industry or to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Reviewer or its Representatives, (ii) was received by the Reviewer or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a third party lawfully possessing and lawfully entitled to disclose such information on a non-confidential basis, or (iii) is required to be disclosed by law or by regulatory or judicial process, subject to compliance with Secton 3(c).\n2. Purpose. Each Party agrees that its review and inspection of the Confidential Information shall be solely to determine whether the Parties desire to proceed with the Transaction.\n3. Non-Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information.\n(a) The Reviewer agrees that all Confidential Information shall be used by the Reviewer solely for the purpose stated in Section 2 and shall be treated by the Reviewer and its Representatives as strictly confidential. The Reviewer further agrees not to disclose, directly or indirectly, any of the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Provider, other than to the following (collectively, the \""REPRESENTATIVES\""): (i) the Reviewer's directors, officer and employees (including those of its affiliates), and (ii) the Reviewer's attorneys, accountants and financial advisors; in each case only to those persons who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose stated in Section 2. The Reviewer shall inform each of its Representatives prior to such Representative receiving any of the Confidential Information of the requirements of this Agreement, and the Reviewer shall be liable for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.\n(b) Neither party will (except as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process, and only after compliance with paragraph 3(c) below), without the prior written consent of the other Party, disclose to any person the fact that the Confidential Information exists or has been made available, that the Parties are considering the Transaction or any other transaction involving the Parties, or that discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the Transaction or involving the Parties or any term, condition or other fact relating to the Transaction or such discussions or negotiations, including, without limitation, the status thereof.\n(c) If the Reviewer or its Representatives are required under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental body to disclose any Confidential Information, the Reviewer shall not do so without first giving the Provider written notice of such request(s) so that the Provider may seek an appropriate protective order or other confidential treatment of the Confidential Information.\n4. No Representation Concerning Confidential Information. The Reviewer acknowledges and agrees that the Provider, in providing Confidential Information hereunder, makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information and that the Provider shall have no obligation or liability to the Reviewer or its Representatives resulting from the use of contents of the Confidential Information or from any action taken or any inaction occuring in reliance on the Confidential Information.\n5. No Obligation to Disclose Confidential Information. Not withstanding any provision of this Agreement, neither party shall have any obligation to furnish or otherwise disclose Confidential Information to the other Party.\n6. Return/Destruction of Confidential Information. If either Party hereto determines not to proceed with the Transaction, it will immediately notify the other Party hereto in writing of that decision. Upon sending of such written notice or earlier upon the request of the Provider, all copies of Confidential Information provided to or in the possession of the Reviewer or its Representatives shall be destroyed or returned promptly to the Provider, together with (i) all copies thereof made by the Reviewer or its Representatives, and (ii) all portions of all compilations, studies, notes, analyses and memoranda prepared in connection with the examination thereof or derived therefrom that contain or reflect any Confidential Information. Upon request of the Provider, the Reviewer shall provide to the Provider a written certificate as to the return or destruction of such Confidential Information. Any oral Confidential Information will continue to be held subject to this Agreement.\n7. Standstill; Non-Solicitation of Employees.\n(a) Buyer agrees that, for a period of one year from the date of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any subsidiary or affiliate of Buyer will, without the prior written consent of CBL or its board of directors: (i) acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any voting securities or rights or options to acquire any voting securities, or securities or instruments convertible into voting securities, of CBL; (ii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any \""SOLICITATION\"" of \""PROXIES\"" (as such terms are used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of CBL; (iii) make any public announcement in connection with any of the foregoing; (iv) form, join or participate in a \""GROUP\"" (as defined in section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in connection with any of the foregoing; or (v) otherwise attempt or join in an attempt by another person or entity that intends to attempt to gain control of CBL. In the event that Buyer becomes aware of any inadvertent acquisition of securities of CBL covered by the foregoing, Buyer shall immediately so notify CBL and as promptly as possible cause such securities to be divested in a commercially reasonable manner.\n(b) Buyer agrees that, for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any subsidiary or affiliate of Buyer will solicit for employment any executive officer or senior employee of CBL; provided, however, (i) Buyer and Buyer's subsidiaries and affiliates shall not be prohibited from employing any such individual who contacts Buyer of any of Buyer's subsidiaries or affiliates on his or her own initiative, and (ii) the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to general solicitations to hire through the use of advertising. Upon Buyer's request, CBL shall provide Buyer with a list of the names and titles of the individuals covered by this Section 7(b).\n8. Amendment. No amendment, modification, or discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought.\n9. Breach of Agreement; Indemnity.\n(a) In the event the Reviewer or any of its Representatives fails in any respect to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the Reviewer shall be liable to the Provider for breach of this Agreement. The Reviewer understands and agrees that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or contemplated breach of this Agreement, and that the Provider shall be entitled to specific performance or other equitable relief by way of restraining orders and injunctions as a remedy for any such breach or contemplated breach without proof of actual damages and without the necessity of posting any bond.\n(b) The rights, powers, and remedies provided for in Section 9(a) shall be in addition to and shall not preclude the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy available to the Provider at law or in equity. No forbearance, failure, or delay in exercising any such right, power, or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude its further exercise.\n(c) The Reviewer hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Provider from and against any and all claims, demands, losses, actions, debts, liabilities, judgements, costs and attorneys' fees and disbursements arising out of, claimed on account of, or in any matter predicted upon or contributed to by a breach of this Agreement by the Reviewer or its Representatives or otherwise incurred by the Provider in enforcing or preserving the Provider's rights under this Agreement.\n10. Term. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall terminate two years after the date of the destruction or return of the Confidential Information to the other Party.\n11. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n12. Severability. This Agreement shall be interpreted so as to give full legal force and effect to all provisions hereof to the maximum extent permitted by the law. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against public policy, such term, provision, covenant or restriction shall be deemed to be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such term, provision, covenant or restriction enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law, and the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law and shall in now way be affected, impaired or invalidated.\n13. No Further Obligations or Agreements Hereunder. Neither party shall be under any obligation to enter into any further agreements with the other Party as a result of this Agreement. Each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to make, to retract or to reject at any time any proposal which has not yet become legally binding by execution of a written agreement between the Parties with respect to any further agreements or business arrangements with the other Party or its parents, subsidiaries or other affiliates, and to terminate all further discussion and negotiations.\n14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Transmission by facsimile of an executed counterpart signature page hereof by a Party shall constitute due execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Party.\n15. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of Maryland applicable to contracts between residents of that State and executed in and to be performed in that State, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.\n16. Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the Parties and relating to the subject matter hereof and to the treatment of Confidential Information heretofore or hereafter reviewed or inspected by either Party or its Representatives.\n17. Jurisdiction; Forum. Each Party hereto hereby (a) submits to the jurisdiction of any Maryland court or Federal court sitting in Baltimore City, Maryland with respect to all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims with respect to any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Maryland court or Federal court, (c) waives the defense of inconvenient forum, and (d) agrees that a final judgement in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgement or in any other manner provided by the law.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, duly authorized representatives of the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first set above.\nBUYER:\nBy: /s/ Alex Glasenberg\nTitle: V.P.

"      July 24, 1997\nBorden Chemical, Inc.\n180 East Broad Street, 24th Floor\nColumbus, OH 43215-3799\nAttn: Joseph M. Saggese\nChairman\nDear Mr. Saggese:\nMelamine Chemicals, Inc. (\""MCI\"") and Borden Chemical, Inc. (the \""Company\"") are prepared to engage in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business combination involving the Company and MCI (the \""Transaction\""), and during the course of such discussions MCI may disclose and make available to the Company certain information concerning MCI's business, prospects, financial condition, operations, technology, assets and liabilities. All such information furnished to the Company or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of MCI (irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is furnished prior to, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by the Company or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to herein as the \""Confidential Information.\"" As a condition to being furnished the Confidential Information, the Company agrees as follows:\n1. NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. (a) the Company shall (i) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no other competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, officers, employees and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers and attorneys) acting on its behalf (such directors, officers, employees and representatives being referred to hereinafter collectively as its \""Representatives\"") who in each case, in the Company's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction; provided, however, that prospective financing sources shall not be considered \""Representatives\"" to whom Confidential Information may be disclosed in accordance with this paragraph 1 unless specifically requested by the Company and consented to by MCI in writing; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement (the \""Agreement\"") by its Representatives.\n(b) If the Company or its Representatives is requested (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Company will provide MCI with prompt notice of such request so that MCI may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Company and its Representatives may disclose without liability hereunder only that portion of the Confidential Information that the Company is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the Company gives MCI written notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon MCI's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE OF NEGOTIATIONS OR AGREEMENTS. Except as required by law, neither the Company nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or agreements concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any similar terms, agreements or understandings between the Company and MCI with respect thereto, or that the Company has received from MCI Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other, which consent will not be withheld unreasonably.\n3. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. All written Confidential Information delivered by or on behalf of MCI to the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be and remain the property of MCI and upon the written request of MCI, the Company shall (i) promptly return such Confidential Information and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof, (ii) destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, or other documents derived from or containing Confidential Information, and all copies and other reproductions and extracts thereof, and (iii) upon written request by MCI provide a certificate to MCI certifying that the foregoing materials have, in fact, been destroyed or returned, signed by an authorized officer supervising such destruction or return. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Company and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder, until the expiration of three years from the date of this Agreement, unless a lesser duration is specified herein.\n4. INFORMATION NOT DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term \""Confidential Information\"" does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Company or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; or (ii) was or becomes available to the Company from a source other than MCI or its Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the Company to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to MCI or its Representatives or (iii) was already known to the Company at the time of its disclosure by MCI.\n5. NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. Neither MCI nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it, and no liability shall result to MCI from its use, except as set forth in a definitive agreement for a Transaction. Only the representations and warranties that are made in a definitive agreement for a Transaction, when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.\n6. NO AGREEMENT. MCI has the absolute right to determine what information, properties and personnel it wishes to make available to the Company. Unless a definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between the Company and MCI has been executed and delivered, neither MCI, the Company nor any of their stockholders or affiliates will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such Transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the other party at any time.\n7. CONTACT PERSONS; NO SOLICITATION. All requests by the Company for Confidential Information, meetings with personnel or inspection of properties and all other communications regarding a possible Transaction shall be made only to the contacts designated by MCI (the \""Contact Persons\""). The Company agrees that, for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, it will not initiate or maintain contact (except in the ordinary course of business) with any director, officer, employee, distributor or customer of MCI regarding MCI's business operations, prospects or finances, except as may be permitted by the Contact Persons for due diligence purposes. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to limit the right of the parties to compete with one another in the ordinary course. The Company further agrees that, for a period of two years from the date hereof, it will not directly or indirectly offer employment to (other than by means of a general advertisement) or hire any of MCI's employees with whom it has had contact during the process contemplated by this Agreement.\n8. NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION. MCI has outstanding publicly-held securities and the Confidential Information contains material non-public information. The Company acknowledges that it is (i) aware, and has advised or will advise its Representatives, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person in possession of material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, and from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may purchase or sell such securities and (ii) familiar with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \""Exchange Act\""), and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the Company agrees that it will neither use nor permit any of its Representatives to use any Confidential Information in violation of such Act or rules or regulations, including without limitation Rule 10b-5.\n9. STANDSTILL. The Company agrees that, until the expiration of two years from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written invitation (on an unsolicited basis) of MCI's Board of Directors, it and its affiliates will not (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal or offer or otherwise seek to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities (or rights in respect thereof), assets or property of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control thereof, whether such agreements or proposals or offers are made with or to MCI or any of its subsidiaries (or a successor thereto or person in control thereof) or a third party; (ii) enter into or agree, offer, seek or propose to enter into or otherwise be involved in or part of, directly or indirectly, any merger, acquisition transaction or other business combination relating to MCI or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets; (iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any \""solicitation\"" of \""proxies\"" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules under the Exchange Act) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control thereof; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \""group\"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of MCI or any of its subsidiaries or of any successor thereto or person in control thereof; (v) seek or propose, alone or in concert with others, to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of MCI; (vi) directly or indirectly enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any other person (except internal discussions and planning activities involving its Representatives) with respect to any of the foregoing activities or propose any of such activities to any other person (other than its Representatives); (vii) directly or indirectly advise, encourage, assist, act as a financing source for or otherwise invest in any other person in connection with any of the foregoing; or (viii) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing. The Company also agrees that, during such two-year period, neither it nor any of its affiliates will: (i) request MCI or its advisors, directly or indirectly, to (1) amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (2) otherwise consent to any action inconsistent with any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence); or (ii) take any initiative with respect to MCI or any of it's subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to require MCI to make a public announcement regarding (1) such initiative, (2) any of the activities referred to in this paragraph, (3) the possibility of a Transaction or any similar transaction or (4) the possibility of the Company's or any other person's acquiring control of MCI, whether by means of a business combination or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 9, the Company's chief executive officer may contact MCI's chief executive officer for the purpose of expressing continuing or renewed interest in a Transaction, provided that, unless invited to do so by MCI's chief executive officer, no offer or proposal shall be made that would require public disclosure or formal consideration by MCI or its Board of Directors.\n10. PERSON. The term \""person\"" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include the media and any corporation, company, group, partnership, governmental body or other entity or individual.\n11. NO WAIVER. No failure or delay by MCI in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n12. REMEDIES. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Company and that MCI shall be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance and injunction, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by the Company but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to MCI, including remedies pursuant to applicable laws relating to trade secrets.\n13. BENEFITS; GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is for the benefit of MCI and its respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents and its respective successors and assigns and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws and not the choice of law rules of the State of Louisiana.\n14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.\n15. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not be deemed to affect any other provision hereof or the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted herefrom to the minimum extent necessary to cure such invalidity or unenforceability.\n16. MODIFICATIONS. No provision of this Agreement may be waived, amended or modified except by the written agreement of the Company and MCI.\nPlease confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning one copy of this letter to the undersigned, whereupon this letter shall become a binding agreement between us.\nMELAMINE CHEMICALS, INC.\nBy: /s/ Goldman, Sachs & Co.\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of

"      [LETTERHEAD OF MERIDIAN POINT REALTY TRUST VIII COMPANY APPEARS HERE]\nEXHIBIT (c)(2)\nFebruary 10, 1998\nDavid H. Hoster II President and Chief Executive Officer\nEASTGROUP PROPERTIES INC.\n300 One Jackson Place 188 East Capitol Street\nJackson, MS 39201-2195\nRe: EastGroup Offer to Merge\nDear Mr. Hoster:\nEastGroup Properties Inc. (\""you\"" or \""your\"") has requested information regarding Meridian Point Realty Trust VIII, (the \""Company,\"") in connection with your consideration of the possible investment in or acquisition of all or part of the assets or equity of the Company (a \""Possible Transaction\""). In consideration of the Company furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:\nConfidentiality of Evaluation Materials\nYou will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either the Company or its representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the \""Evaluation Materials\""). You recognize and acknowledge the confidential and non-public nature of the Evaluation Materials, the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials, and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \""Evaluation Materials\"" includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection regarding the Company, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \""confidential\"". The term \""Evaluation Materials\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other\nPage 2\nthan as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you.\nUse of Evaluation Materials\nYou will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \""your representatives\"") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you, and shall each expressly agree, to treat such information confidentially in accordance with this Agreement), (ii) you may disclose Evaluation Materials that you have been advised by counsel are required to be disclosed under applicable securities laws; and (iii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. You will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your representatives.\nOther than with respect to those Evaluation Materials you have been advised by counsel are required to be disclosed under applicable securities laws, in the event that you or any of your representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) you shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by you or your representatives not permitted by this Agreement.\nNon-Disclosure\nThe disclosure of your access to the Evaluation Materials at this time could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and the pursuit of its strategic alternatives if for any reason a Possible Transaction is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, including applicable securities laws that counsel has advised you require disclosure of Evaluation Materials, you agree that without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that you have been provided access to the Evaluation Materials or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction between you and the Company as a result thereof, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof. The term \""person\"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.\nReturn of Documents\nUpon the Company's request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company.\nPage 4\nNo Unauthorized Contact or Solicitation\nDuring the course of your evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to employees or representatives of the Company as specified by the Company. You also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by you and such third party that involves use of the Evaluation Materials without the Company's prior written consent.\nNo Representation or Warranty\nAlthough the Company has endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of your investigation, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Company or the Company's representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company or the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to you or any other person resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by you or any of your representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to you in a formal written agreement involving your investment in or acquisition of all or part of the assets or equity of the Company, when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such agreement, will have any legal effect.\nYou also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until a formal written agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, and you hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with a Possible Transaction unless and until a formal written agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver or release of any claim or action that you may have as a shareholder of the Company, based upon your status as a shareholder. You also agree that unless and until a formal written agreement between the Company and you with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \""formal written agreement\"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by you.\nYou further understand and agree that (i) the Company shall be free to conduct the process for a Possible Transaction as it in its sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any prospective interested parties and entering into a formal agreement without prior notice to you or to any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such Possible Transaction may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person and (iii) unless and until a formal written agreement concerning the Possible Transaction has been executed, neither the Company or any of its directors, officers, employees, stockholders, owners, affiliates, agents or representatives will have any liability to you with respect to the Possible Transaction, whether by virtue of this letter agreement, any other written or oral expression regarding a Possible Transaction or otherwise.\nLegal Remedy\nYou understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by your or your representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity provided however any suit for damages shall be specifically limited to actual provable damages, and Company hereby waives any and all rights to seek consequential, punitive, treble or other compensatory damages of any types or kind.\nOther\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.\nIf you are in agreement within the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.\nVery truly yours,\nMERIDIAN POINT REALTY TRUST VIII\nBy: /s/ Robert H.

"      AGREEMENT FOR NON-DISCLOSURE OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND STANDSTILL\nThis Agreement, made as of this 13th day of March, 1997, by and between CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY, with a principal place of business located at 935 de La Gauchetiere St. W., Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada, and ILLINOIS CENTRAL CORP., with a principal place of business located at 455 North Cityfront Plaza Drive, Chicago, State of Illinois, is to assure the protection and preservation of the confidential and proprietary nature of information to be disclosed or made available under this Agreement, and shall be governed by and enforceable under, the laws of the State of New York.\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the parties hereto (each referred to herein as a \""Party\"") are giving consideration to a possible transaction, including a possible business combination, joint venture or other possible arrangement involving the parties (a \""Business Arrangement\"") and in connection therewith it is expected that each Party furnish to the other Party certain Proprietary Information (as defined below);\nAND WHEREAS, each Party desires to assure the confidential and proprietary status of the Proprietary Information which may be disclosed hereunder;\nAND WHEREAS, the parties also desire that any Proprietary Information that is disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the other Party or, as permitted hereunder, to its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, representatives (including financial advisors, attorneys and accountants) or agents (collectively, \""Representatives\""), be used only for the purposes of evaluating a possible Business Arrangement;\nAGREEMENT\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged; the parties agree as follows:\n1. The Party receiving Proprietary Information (the \""Recipient\"") and its Representatives will protect all Proprietary Information received under this Agreement from any disclosure to third parties or the use of such Proprietary Information beyond that allowed under this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this Agreement, and will not engage in such disclosure or use without the prior express written permission of the Party disclosing such information (the \""Disclosing Party\"").\n2. Proprietary Information which may be supplied and is protected under this Agreement includes, but is not limited to: all business plans, specifications, reports, manuals, data books, computer programs, techniques, employment arrangements, and all other business practices or information of a private nature on any media whatsoever, and any derivatives of the foregoing, including, without limitation, any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, memoranda or other documents prepared by the Recipient, or its Representatives, which contain, reflect or are based on, in whole or in part, such proprietary information (collectively, \""Proprietary Information\""). Such Proprietary Information includes data transferred in the form of, but not limited to, oral, written, graphic or computer media including telephone, and meeting conversations, as well as all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents which include any Proprietary Information. The term \""Proprietary Information\"" does not include confidential information which (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's Representatives, (ii) was available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to Recipient by Disclosing Party or its Representatives, (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without the use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, or (iv) becomes available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Disclosing Party or its Representatives, provided that such source, to Recipient's knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with Disclosing Party or its Representatives, or is otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to Recipient by a contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation. In the event that Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigation demand or other similar process) or required by the rules of any relevant stock exchange or other relevant regulatory authority to disclose any Proprietary Information, Recipient or its Representatives shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Recipient or its Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, required to disclose Proprietary Information, the Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which in the opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the Recipient or its Representatives attempt to preserve the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Proprietary Information.\n3. Recipient agrees to keep confidential or protect such Proprietary Information as it would its own confidential and proprietary information at the highest level of proprietary material. Disclosure of such Proprietary Information shall be restricted to those Representatives of Recipient who (i) have a need to know the information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Business Arrangement between the parties and (ii) are informed by the Disclosing Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party will cause its Representatives to observe the terms of this Agreement and the Disclosing Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n4. All Proprietary Information, including all applicable intellectual property rights residing in the Proprietary Information (including without limitation, patents, copyrights, industrial designs, trademarks and trade secrets), unless otherwise specified in writing by Disclosing Party, are and shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, including any and all reproductions in any form of said Proprietary Information. All such Proprietary Information (whether prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives on its behalf) shall be returned or destroyed, at the election of Disclosing Party or upon request of Disclosing Party provided, however, that all notes, analyses, conditions, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents, to the extent that they contain, reflect or are based upon the Proprietary Information, may be destroyed (rather than delivered); provided further that Board or Board Committee minutes need neither be delivered nor destroyed. Upon the request of Disclosing Party, Recipient shall execute a certificate of destruction of such Proprietary Information when destroyed by Recipient, whether intentionally or accidentally, and transmit the same to Disclosing Party.\n5. Proprietary Information supplied under this Agreement shall only be reproduced when legitimately required for Recipient's purposes and in conformity with the provisions hereof.\n6. Recipient hereby agrees that it will not use the Proprietary Information for any reason or purpose other than to evaluate a possible Business Arrangement with the Disclosing Party and that the use of the Proprietary Information supplied hereunder shall be limited to Recipient's activities in connection therewith. For greater certainty nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting or conferring upon the Recipient or its Representatives, any rights by license or otherwise, for any invention, discovery or improvement made, conceived or acquired, prior to or after the date of this Agreement based in whole, or in part, upon Proprietary Information provided to the Recipient or its Representatives hereunder.\n7. Neither Party, nor any of their respective Representatives will, without the prior written consent of the other Party, disclose to any person the fact that the Proprietary Information exists or has been made available, that such Party is considering a proposed Business Arrangement with the other Party, or that discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning a proposed Business Arrangement or any term condition or other fact relating to a proposed Business Arrangement or such discussions or negotiations, including, without limitation, the status thereof, except if it has received legal advice that such disclosure is reasonably required under then existing circumstances pursuant to any securities or similar laws of any relevant state or country, or rules of any relevant stock exchange or other relevant authority of whatever nature; provided, however, that each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other before issuing an announcement or a public statement.\n8. In the event that Recipient violates this Agreement or Disclosing Party has reasonable cause to feel that its Proprietary Information is in danger of being disclosed or misused, either Party may at any time, in addition to all other recourse under law, terminate this Agreement and demand and be entitled to the return from Recipient of all Proprietary Information in all existing forms.\n9. It is further understood and agreed that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Recipient and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctions and orders for specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to Disclosing Party.\n10. Neither Party, nor any of their Representatives or controlling persons within the meaning of Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder, and each Party agrees that no such person will have any liability relating to the Proprietary Information or for any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Each Party further agrees that neither Party shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information and that each Party will be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties as may be included in any definitive agreement with respect to any agreement that may be entered into between the parties hereafter, subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be contained therein.\n11. Each Party agrees that until the expiry of eighteen (18) months from the date of this Agreement, each Party or its parent and affiliated companies (herein, collectively a \""Party\""), will not, and each Party will direct its parent and affiliated companies not to, except with the prior written consent of the other Party (i) purchase, acquire, obtain or hold (or offer or agree to purchase, acquire, obtain or hold) beneficial ownership of any of the securities of the other Party; (ii) make, or in any way participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any of the other Party's securities; (iii) enter into, or agree to enter into or seek or propose any merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer, sale or purchase of assets or securities, dissolution, liquidation, restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the other Party; (iv) act, alone or together with any person, to control or influence the management or the Board of Directors or other Party; or (v) advise, encourage, or assist any person in the acquisition of beneficial ownership of any of the other Party's securities or control of the other Party or a significant portion of its significant assets; provided, however, that such restrictions (or the restrictions set forth in the next sentence) shall terminate in the event that a third party publicly commences a tender or exchange offer, or otherwise proposes a merger or business combination transaction, in respect of the other Party and such other Party has (a) exempted such transaction for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (b) publicly announced or publicly confirmed that it is engaged in negotiations in connection with such proposed transaction; provided, further, any such termination shall not relieve the parties of any obligations hereunder with respect to the Proprietary Information. Each Party also agrees during such eighteen (18) month period not to (i) request the other Party or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provisions of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (ii) take any initiative in respect of the other Party which would, upon the advice of counsel, reasonably require the other Party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of such Party acquiring, with or without others, control of the other Party whether by means of business combination or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 11, Party shall include its parent and affiliated companies.\n12. If, at any time during the period prior to the time that either Party notifies the other of its decision not to proceed with any Business Arrangement, either Party is approached by, or commences discussions with, any third party concerning its or their participation in a transaction involving the other's securities or a significant portion of its assets or its significant businesses, the contacted Party will promptly inform the other of the nature of such contact and the parties thereto.\n13. This Agreement shall supersede all prior oral and written agreements, communications and documents between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and no modification to this Agreement shall be effective unless approved in writing by both parties. A waiver of any term of this Agreement shall, to be effective, be evidenced in writing by the waiving Party. Each Party agrees that, unless and until a definitive agreement between each of the Parties with respect to a Business Arrangement has been executed and delivered, neither of us will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by the Party's Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \""definitive agreement\"" shall not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement unless and to the extent it expressly states that it is to be legally binding. The agreement set forth in this paragraph may be modified or waived only by a separate writing by each of us expressly so modifying or waiving such agreement.\n14. Nothing in this Agreement shall grant to either Party the right to make commitments of any kind for or on behalf of the other Party.\n15. The provisions of this Agreement pertaining to Proprietary Information disclosed under this Agreement shall continue and survive for a period of three (3) years after the termination of this

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT (\""Agreement\"") is made as of January 31, 2001 by and between Sunglass Hut International, Inc., a Florida corporation (\""Sunglass Hut\""), and Luxottica Group S.p.A, an Italian corporation (\""Luxottica\"") (Sunglass Hut and Luxottica are collectively referred to herein as the \""Parties\"").\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to provide for the disclosure of information relating to Sunglass Hut and maintenance of the confidentiality thereof with respect of the evaluation by Luxottica of a possible transaction (the \""Possible Transaction\"");\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n1. DEFINITIONS. The following terms are defined as follows:\n(a) \""Evaluation Material\"" means any oral or written information concerning Sunglass Hut, its subsidiaries, business, markets, products, prospects or finances furnished by it (in such capacity, the \""Provider\"") or any of its Representatives (as defined below) to Luxottica (in such capacity, the \""Recipient\"") or any of its Representatives, except information which: (i) is or becomes generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Recipient or any of its Representatives who received such information pursuant hereto); (ii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or any of its Representatives on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Provider or any of its Representatives; provided, that such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other similar obligation to, the Provider of which the Recipient or any of its Representatives are aware; or (iii) has been independently acquired or developed by the Recipient or any of its Representatives without violating any of its obligations under this Agreement.\n(b) A \""Representative\"" of a Party includes any officer, director, shareholder, employee, advisor, attorney, consultant or agent of such Party.\n2. USE OF EVALUATION MATERIAL. Any Evaluation Material provided to the Recipient hereunder will be used by the Recipient and its Representatives solely for the purpose of evaluating the Possible Transaction and will not be used by the Recipient in any way detrimental to the Provider or its stockholders. The Recipient will maintain the strict confidentiality of any Evaluation Material provided to it or any of its Representatives by the other Party or any of the other Party's Representatives and will not disclose any part of it to any other person; provided, however, that it may disclose any such Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its Representatives who need to know such information in order to assist the Recipient in evaluating the advisability of entering into the Possible Transaction and it may disclose any such Evaluation Material in accordance with Paragraph 5 hereof.\n3. REPRESENTATIVES. The Recipient will (a) provide the other Party with a list of its Representatives who are given access to any Evaluation Material, (b) inform each such Representative of the terms of this Agreement, and (c) obtain the agreement of each such Representative to abide by the terms of this Agreement. Each Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n4. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities and costs that any other Party may sustain or incur as a result of any breach of this Agreement by such Party or any of its Representatives.\n5. SUBPOENAS, ETC. If the Recipient or any of its Representatives becomes required by law or applicable legal process (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Evaluation Material furnished by the Provider, the Recipient will provide the Provider with prompt prior written notice of such requirement and the terms of and circumstances surrounding such requirement so that the Provider may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Recipient will provide such cooperation with respect to obtaining a protective order or other remedy as the Provider may reasonably request. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Provider is required to waive compliance with the provisions hereof, Recipient will furnish only that portion of such Evaluation Material which, as it is advised in a written opinion by its counsel, is legally required to furnish and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment, if available, will be accorded such Evaluation Material.\n6. TERMINATION. If any Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Possible Transaction, it will promptly advise the other Parties of that decision. In such event, the Recipient promptly will return to the Provider all copies of any Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of any of its Representatives furnished by such Provider or any of its Representatives, and the Recipient will destroy all analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by it or any of its Representatives or for their use containing or reflecting any Evaluation Material, whether in digital, written or other form. Any destruction required pursuant to this Paragraph 6 will be certified in writing to the Provider by an authorized officer supervising such destruction.\n7. NON-DISCLOSURE. Without the prior written consent of the other Party, each Party will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any person that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction, that such Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any Possible Transaction, including the status thereof.\n8. NO SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Each Party covenants that for a period of two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of the other Party or any of the other Party's subsidiaries with whom such Party has had contact or who became known to such Party in connection with its consideration of the Possible Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision will not prevent a Party from employing any employee of the other Party who contacts the prospective employer Party on his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the prospective employer Party, or prevent a general solicitation conducted in the ordinary course of business and not directed specifically at the employees of the other Party.\n9. ACCURACY OF MATERIALS. The Provider does not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials provided or to be provided by it or any of its Representatives. Neither the Provider nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Recipient or any person resulting from the Recipient's use of any Evaluation Material provided by the Provider or any of its Representatives or the contents thereof or from any action taken or any inaction occurring in reliance thereon.\n10. NO COMMITMENT. No contract or agreement providing for any transaction or other arrangement between the Parties exists. Neither Party nor any of their respective stockholders or owners will have any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any transaction or other arrangement by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to any transaction or other arrangement except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each Party will be free to conduct or terminate the process whereby it may enter into any transaction or other arrangement as such Party in its sole discretion will determine. No Party will have any claims whatsoever against the other Party or any of the other Party's Representatives arising out or relating to any transaction or other arrangement. Neither this Paragraph 10 nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of both Parties.\n11. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. Each Party acknowledges that it is aware (and that its Representatives who are apprised of a Proposed Transaction have been, or upon being so apprised will be, advised) of the restrictions imposed by certain securities laws on a person possessing material non-public information about certain companies and agrees to comply with such laws.\n12. EQUITABLE REMEDIES. The Parties acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered in the event that this Agreement is breached. Therefore, each Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other Party or any of its Representatives, in addition to all other remedies available to such Party at law or in equity.\n13. NO WAIVERS. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n14. INTEGRATION. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements and understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n15. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. All Parties' obligations under this Agreement will expire one year from the date of this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first hereinabove written.\nSUNGLASS HUT INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nBy: /s/ James N.

This confidential information relates to Cable Data Modem.\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. (a) All of the confidential information (hereinafter \""Confidential Information\""), including, without limitation, all information relating to business plans, financial or technical matters, trade secrets, designs, know-how, inventions, operations and any other information received or acquired by one party (\""Receiving Party\"") from the other (\""Disclosing Party\"") in the course of exploring the possible business relationship shall be in written form and marked \""Confidential,\"" with the name of the Disclosing Party and the date of disclosure. If the Confidential Information is initially disclosed orally, it shall be reduced to written form by the Disclosing Party (including the date of the oral disclosure and name of the Disclosing Party) and presented or mailed to the Receiving Party within fifteen (15) days of the first oral disclosure.\n(b) The Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party.\n(c) All information disclosed which is not marked \""Confidential,\"" or not reduced to written form and marked \""Confidential\"" if initially disclosed orally shall be considered to be non-confidential and shall not be subject to the obligations imposed by this Agreement. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement shall be limited to the subject matter mentioned in the Recital. The existence and terms of this Agreement shall be treated as Confidential Information.\n2. The Receiving Party shall:\n(a) hold the Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties, except in the limited cases referred to in paragraph \""6\""; and\n(b) not use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than exploring or examining the possibility of a business relationship between the parties.\n3. Either party hereto shall have the right, at any time, to terminate in writing and discussions and exchange of information in connection with the exploration of the possibilities of a business relationship between the parties without any further obligations or liabilities to the other party, other than the obligations of confidentiality hereunder, or any right or obligation relating to the Confidential Information hereunder.\n4.(i) The obligations of the above paragraph \""2\"" shall not apply to any information which:\n(a) is available to the public through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; or\n(b) was in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; or\n(c) is received independently from a third party who is free to disclose such information to the Receiving Party; or\n(d) is subsequently independently developed by the Receiving Party; or\n(e) has been or is made public by the Disclosing Party, such as by commercial use or sale or by publications or patents, or otherwise; or\n(f) is approved for release by written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n(ii) Disclosure of Confidential Information shall not be precluded if such disclosure is pursuant to the requirement or request of a governmental agency or by operation of law. Provided, however, the Receiving Party shall promptly give a written notice to the Disclosing party so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order.\n5. All Confidential Information delivered to and/or in the possession of the Receiving Party shall be returned or delivered to the Disclosing Party, with all copies made thereof, in whatever form, if the Disclosing Party so requests.\n6. The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information shall be disclosed to only those people within its respective organizations or its agents, consultants, representatives or advisors who have a need to know the information and who are obligated under terms no less restrictive than those imposed by this Agreement on the Receiving Party.\n7. Each party shall have the right to refuse to accept any information under this Agreement, and nothing herein shall obligate either party to disclose to the other party any particular information. Further, each party acknowledges that no contract or agreement providing for a business relationship, of any nature, shall be deemed to exist unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered.\n8. If any official approval is required by a government authority or disclose the Confidential Information hereunder, such disclosure is subject to that approval. Both parties shall comply in all respects with applicable laws, regulations and court orders, including but not limited to laws and regulations on export control, in both parties' countries and other applicable countries.\n9. Disclosure of any information under this Agreement, or otherwise, shall not be construed as granting, directly or by implication, any license under or interest of any kind in any patent, patent application, copyright or other intellectual property rights.\n10. The Disclosing Party represents and warrants that it has the right to disclose the information disclosed under the terms of this Agreement and that disclosure of this information does not conflict with the terms of any agreement between the Disclosing Party and a third party.\n11. The parties hereto shall not be obligated to compensate each other for the disclosure and/or use pursuant to the terms of this Agreement of any information exchanged in connection with this Agreement or the discussions between the parties.\n12. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, representations and statements, whether oral or written, between the parties relating to the disclosure of the Confidential Information. The terms of this Agreement may not be changed except by subsequent written agreement duly signed by an officer of each of the parties.\n13. Subject to Paragraph \""4\"" hereof, the obligation of the Receiving Party provided in Paragraph \""2\"" hereof shall continue for three (3) years from the date of each receipt of the Confidential Information, even after termination of this Agreement according to paragraph \""3\"" hereof.\n14. This Agreement shall be governed, construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Japan.\n15. The Receiving Party acknowledges that remedies of damages may be inadequate to protect against breach of this Agreement and the Receiving Party agrees in advance to the granting of injunctive or other equitable relief to the Disclosing Party in addition to any other remedy which may be available to the Disclosing Party.\n16. The Disclosing Party does not make any representation or warranty, except as may be specifically provided in writing, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, or as to its utility or suitability for any purpose of the Receiving Party and the Disclosing Party expressly disclaims any right of the Receiving Party to rely thereon, or any liability to the Receiving Party resulting from the use of the Confidential Information.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties by their duly authorized representatives have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date first set forth above.\nHYBRID NETWORKS, INC.

In order to induce the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Undersigneds have agreed and the Purchaser has required the Undersigneds to enter into this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n1. RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.\n1.1 The Undersigneds acknowledge and agree that: (i) the business contacts, customers, suppliers, technology, know-how, trade secrets, marketing and distribution techniques, and other aspects of the business of the Corporation have been of value to the Corporation, and have provided the Corporation (and will hereafter provide the Purchaser) with substantial competitive advantage in the operation of its business, and (ii) by virtue of their previous relationships with the Corporation as officers, managers, Shareholders, employees, and/or affiliates, the Undersigneds have detailed knowledge and possess confidential information concerning the business and operations of the Corporation.\n1.2 It is hereby agreed that none of the Undersigneds shall, directly, or indirectly, for itself or themselves, or through or on behalf of any other person or entity including, without limitation, family members, trusts, or other business or estate planning arrangements engage in the following:\n(a) at any time, divulge, transmit, or otherwise disclose or cause to be divulged, transmitted, or otherwise disclose, any business contacts, client, distributor, or customer lists, technology, know-how, traded secrets, marketing techniques, supplier contacts, contracts, or other confidential or proprietary information of the Corporation of whatever nature existing on or prior to the date hereof (provided, however, that for purposes hereof, information shall not be considered to be confidential or proprietary if (i) it is a matter of common knowledge or public record, (ii) it is generally known in the industry in which the Business is engaged, or (iii) the Undersigneds can demonstrate that such information was already known to the recipient thereof other than by reason of any breach of any obligation under this Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement);\n(b) at any time during the period of the Purchase Agreement and for two years following the termination of the Purchase Agreement for any reason (the \""Restrictive Period\""), invest, carry on, engage, or become involved, either as an employee, agent, advisor, officer, director, stockholder (excluding ownership of not more than 3% of the outstanding shares of a publicly held Corporation if such ownership does not involve managerial or operational responsibility), manager, partner, joint venture, participant, or consultant, in any business enterprise (other than the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, or assigns) which (i) is located or operating, or soliciting customers located in the United States of America or any other country in which Purchaser sells products, and (ii) is or becomes, at any time during the Restrictive Period, engaged in the manufacture, assembly, sale, marketing, advertising, and distribution of golf balls or any golf related products.

CONSIDERATION.\nIn consideration for the covenants contained herein, the Purchaser has agreed to enter into the Asset Purchase Agreement to be executed in conjunction with this Agreement.\n4. REMEDIES.\n4.1 In the event of a breach of this Agreement by any either of the Undersigneds, the precise amount of damages that may be suffered by the Purchaser of reason of such breach may be difficult to ascertain; accordingly, the parties hereby agree that, as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) in respect of any such breach, the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may choose to demand the sum of $20,000 as the sole and exclusive damages for the breach. The parties agree that the foregoing provision for liquidated damages, if chosen by Purchaser, constitutes a fair and reasonable estimate of the actual damages that might be suffered by reason of a breach of this Agreement by the Undersigneds. Alternatively, and in lieu of its right to demand liquidated damages as aforesaid, the Purchaser may elect to pursue and recover all actual damages, incurred by the Purchaser as a result of such breach, insofar as they can be determined.\n4.2 The Undersigneds and the Purchaser hereby further acknowledge and agree that any breach by either of the Undersigneds, directly or indirectly, of the foregoing restrictive covenants will cause the Purchaser irreparable injury for which there is not adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each of the Undersigneds expressly agrees that, in the event of any such breach or any threatened breach hereunder by any of the Undersigneds, directly or indirectly, the Purchaser shall be entitled, in addition to any and all other remedies available (including but not limited to the damages provided for in paragraph 4.1 above), to seek and obtain injunctive and/or other equitable relief to require specific performance of or prevent, restrain, and/or enjoin a breach under the provisions of this Agreement.\n5.

The parties acknowledge that any disclosure of such methods, processes, skills, financial data, or other confidential or proprietary information would substantially injure the party's business, impair the party's investments and goodwill, and jeopardize the party's relationship with the party's clients and customers;\nWHEREAS, the parties presently desire to consult with each other with respect to certain matters;\nWHEREAS, in the course of such consultation the parties anticipate disclosing to each other certain information of a novel, proprietary, or confidential nature, and desire that such information be subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth below.\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information. \""Confidential Information\"" shall mean and include any information which relates to the financial and/or business operations of each party, including, but not limited to, information relating to each party's customers, products, processes, financial condition, employees, manufacturing techniques, experimental work and/or trade secrets. Said Confidential Information is deemed proprietary by the parties hereto. The Subject Matter of this Agreement, as well as any additional information disclosed hereunder that is deemed Confidential Information by the parties is described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.\n2. Use of Confidential Information. Each party agrees not to use the other's Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the specific consultation regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. Any other use of such Confidential Information shall be made only upon the prior written consent from an authorized representative of the party which disclosed such information (hereinafter the \""Disclosing Party\"") or pursuant to subsequent agreement between the parties.\n3. Non-Disclosure of Proprietary Information. The parties agree that from the date of receipt, the party receiving the Confidential Information (hereinafter the \""Receiving Party\"") shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other person, firm, corporation or other entity or use it for its own benefit except as provided in this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall not publish, divulge, communicate, or reveal any Confidential Information to any person, corporation, or other third party or to any of Receiving Party's employees who do not have a need to know such Confidential Information with respect to their job duties. The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care to avoid publication or dissemination of the Confidential Information as it would with respect to its own confidential information. These efforts shall specifically include document control measures, such as numbered copies and sign out logs, and imposing on all employees, agents and other representatives of Receiving Party restrictions at least as strict as required by this Agreement.\n\""Confidential Information\"" shall not include information, technical data or know-how which:\n(a) is already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure and is not otherwise subject to restriction;\n(b) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party;\n(c) rightfully disclosed to Receiving Party by a third party who has no obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party;\n(d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party; or\n(e) is approved for release by written authorization of the Disclosing Party.\n4. Marking. Confidential Information may be disclosed either visually, orally or in writing. Written material shall be identified and labeled \""Confidential\"" or \""Proprietary\"" to discloser. Verbal or visual information should be identified as \""Confidential Information\"" when disclosed.\n5. Return of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information and copies and extracts thereof shall be promptly returned to Disclosing Party three years from the effective date of this Agreement, or at any time within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request by the Disclosing Party for the return of such Confidential Information.\n6. Ownership of Information. The parties agree that any Confidential Information revealed to the other by the Disclosing Party remains the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and its successors and assigns, unless otherwise expressly provided in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party.\n7. No License Granted. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights to the Receiving Party by license or otherwise, expressly, impliedly or otherwise, for any information, discovery or improvement made, conceived, or acquired after the date of this Agreement, or for any invention, discovery, or improvement made, conceived or acquired prior to the date of this Agreement.\n8. Arbitration and Equitable Relief.\n(a) Arbitration. Except as provided in Section 8(b) below, the parties agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to any interpretation, construction, performance or breach of this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration to be held in San Diego County, California in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in such dispute or controversy. In the event of arbitration, a reasonable amount of discovery may be undertaken by the parties. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court having jurisdiction.\n(b) Equitable Remedies. The parties agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to measure and calculate the Disclosing Party's damages from any breach of the covenants set forth herein. Accordingly, the parties agree that if in the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, the affected party will have available, in addition to any other right or remedy available, the right to obtain an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and to specific performance of any such provision of this Agreement. The parties further agree that no bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and the parties hereby consent to the issuance of such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance.\n(c) Legal Expenses. If any action or proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in such action or proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.\n9. Term. This Agreement shall expire two (2) years from the Effective Date, but may be terminated prior to expiration by either party giving thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other party; provided, however, the obligations to protect the Confidential Information in accordance with this Agreement shall survive for a period of five (5) years from the date of the last disclosure of Confidential Information is made under this Agreement.\n10. No Formal Business Obligations. This Agreement shall not constitute, create, give effect to, or otherwise imply a joint venture, pooling arrangement, partnership, or formal business organization of any kind, nor shall it constitute, create, give effect to, or otherwise imply an obligation or commitment on the part of either party to submit a proposal to or perform a contract with the other party. Nothing herein shall be construed as providing for the sharing of profits or loss arising out of the efforts of either or both parties. Neither party will be liable to the other for any of the costs associated with the other's efforts in connection with this Agreement.\n11. General Provisions.\n(a) Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California.\n(b) Severability. If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\n(c) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the parties.\n(d) Headings. All headings used herein are intended for reference purposes only and shall not affect the interpretation, or validity of this Agreement.\n(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Any amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the parties.\nThe parties, by the signatures of their authorized representatives appearing below, acknowledge that they have read and understand each and every term of this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.\nHNC Software Inc.

"      Non-Disclosure Agreement\nEnova Systems, a corporation organized under the laws of California and Eco Power Technology, an Italian company, desire to explore certain possible business transactions and in facilitating that, it is understood and agreed that certain business and trade information which the parties deem confidential may be provided or disclosed by one to the other:\nIn consideration of the receiving party being granted access or continued access to such information, it is agreed as follows:\n1. \""INFORMATION\"" shall mean any information, technical data or know-how relating to the business, services or products of the disclosing party or a third party, including without limitation any research, products, services, developments, inventions, processes, techniques, designs, components, parts, documents, drawings, electronic files, data sketches, plans, programs, specifications, software, and/or distribution, engineering, marketing, financial, merchandising, sales, and salary information and/or other materials (hereinafter collectively referred to as \""INFORMATION\"") which is disclosed by such party or on its behalf, before or after the date hereof, to the other party or its employees or agents, directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, electronically, or by drawings or inspection. \""INFORMATION\"" does not include information, technical data or know-how which the receiving party establishes: (i) is already published or available to the public other than by a breach of this Agreement or any confidentiality obligation owed to the disclosing party; (ii) is rightfully received from a third party without, and not in breach of, any obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is independently developed by personnel or agents of the receiving party without access to the INFORMATION of the other; (iv) is known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; or (v) is produced in compliance with applicable law or a court order, provided that the receiving party first gives the disclosing party reasonable notice of such law or order and gives the disclosing party opportunity to oppose and/or attempt to limit such production.\n2. The receiving party shall hold in trust and confidence, and not disclose to others, by any means, any and all INFORMATION disclosed under this Agreement. INFORMATION may be used by the receiving party only for the purpose of considering or pursuing a business relationship or business transaction with the disclosing party. The receiving party may disclose INFORMATION received under this Agreement to persons within its organization who have a need to know such information and only if such persons are bound in writing (pursuant, for example to a general employee non-disclosure agreement protecting third party confidential information as well as the employer's confidential information) to protect the confidentiality of such INFORMATION. The receiving party further agrees it shall take the same measures, but no less than reasonable security measures, and use the same care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to preserve and protect the secrecy of, and to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of, the disclosing party's INFORMATION as it uses with its own information of similar importance. With respect to tangible materials constituting INFORMATION the receiving party agrees not to analyze any such materials for composition or structure.\n3. Title to all property received by the receiving party from the disclosing party, including all INFORMATION, shall remain at all times the sole property of the disclosing party, and this Agreement shall not be construed to grant to receiving party any licenses or similar rights to such property or INFORMATION (including all intellectual property) disclosed to the receiving party hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the rights of the disclosing party to assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against the receiving party or to impose on either party any obligation to disclose any INFORMATION or to purchase or sell any products.\n4. The receiving party shall, upon request of the disclosing party: (i) return to the disclosing party all documents, drawings, equipment and other tangible materials, including all INFORMATION and all manifestations thereof, delivered to the receiving party under this Agreement, and all copies and reproductions thereof; and (ii) certify to the disclosing party that all such INFORMATION has been returned.\n5. The receiving party's duties under Section 2 of this Agreement expire with respect to any particular item of INFORMATION five years after the date of disclosure hereunder to the receiving party, or three years after the expiration or termination of the relationship between the parties to this Agreement, whichever is later.\n6. The parties further agree to the following terms and conditions:\n(a) Neither party shall without the prior written consent of the other party disclose to a third party any aspect of the commercial relationship between the parties including, but not limited to, pricing, items or quantities offered or sold, payment terms, production methods or schedules, delivery locations and means and suppliers. Each party agrees not to issue any press release or make any statement on the Internet, America on Line, CompuServe, Prodigy or any other public electronic network, or to any analysts or reporters concerning the other party or its products or services, without the other party's prior written authorization.\n(b) Receiving party shall adhere to the U.S. Export Administration Laws and Regulations and shall not export or re-export any technical data or products received from the disclosure or the direct product of such technical data to any proscribed countries.\n(c) Any breach by the receiving party of its obligations under this Agreement will result in irreparable injury to the disclosing party for which damages and other legal remedies will be inadequate. In seeking enforcement of any of these obligations, the disclosing party will be entitled (in addition to other remedies) to preliminary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief.\n(d) If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be construed and limited to the extent necessary, or severed if necessary, in order to eliminate such invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.\n(e) No delay or omission by either party in exercising any right under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by either party on any one occasion is effective only in that instance and will not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right on any other occasion.\n(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.\n(g) This Agreement is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, and the state and federal courts of California shall be the exclusive forum.\n(h) This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the disclosing party and receiving party (or their respective predecessors in interest) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an agreement in writing signed by both parties that specifically refers to this Agreement.\nEco Power Technology ENOVA

The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its employees or agents.\n2.

"      Mr. Larry Addington\nAddington Enterprises, Inc.\n1500 North Big Run Road\nAshland, KY 41102\nMarch 6, 1998\nDear Mr. Addington:\nYou (which term shall include your subsidiaries or other entities controlled by you) have requested information regarding Zeigler Coal Holding Company (which term, together with its subsidiaries or other controlled entities, the \""Company\"", \""us\"" or \""we\"") in connection with your consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a \""Possible Transaction\""). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF EVALUATION MATERIALS\nYou will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION (\""CSFB\""), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in the Company (collectively, the \""Evaluation Materials\""). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \""Evaluation Materials\"" includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection,and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \""confidential.\"" The term \""Evaluation Materials\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential BASIS from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you.\nUSE OF EVALUATION MATERIALS\nYou will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) any of such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \""your representatives\"") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you, and shall each expressly agree, to treat such information confidentially in accordance with this Agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents by writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generosity of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. You will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your representatives.\nIn the event that you or any of your representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist, or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) you shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by you or your representatives not permitted by this Agreement.\nNON-DISCLOSURES\nThe disclosure of your possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof.

"      CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-CIRCUMVENTION AGREEMENT\nTHIS CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-CIRCUMVENTION AGREEMENT (this \""Agreement\"") is made as of this 24th day of September, 2004 by and among JD Holdings, LLC (\""Originator\"") and GIC Real Estate, Inc. (\""Participant\"").\nWHEREAS, Originator is considering entering into a transaction with the entity set forth on Exhibit I attached hereto (\""Target\"") (whether structured as a purchase of assets, a purchase of securities, a merger, consolidation, combination, recapitalization, refinancing, restructuring, reorganization or otherwise, a \""Transaction\""); and\nParticipant may participate with Originator in the due diligence review and negotiations regarding the Transaction and in the consummation of the Transaction, in each case on such terms and in such capacity as may be mutually agreeable to Originator and Participant (the \""Participation\"");\nWHEREAS, Originator or its Representative may execute a confidentiality agreement with Target (a \""Confidentiality Agreement\"") pursuant to which Originator may agree to maintain the confidentiality of certain information and to refrain from certain activities in respect of Target's employees, and including for purposes herein, without limitation, all financial analysis and models relating to various post-Transaction structures and including all information and materials in respect of Originator which would constitute confidential information if Originator were substituted for Target throughout the Confidentiality Agreement and Participant were substituted for Originator) (such information referred to herein as \""Evaluation Material\""); and\nWHEREAS, in connection with the Participation, Participant may have access to the Evaluation Material.\nNOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration (including, without limitation, Originator's making available the Evaluation Material to Participant and Originator's engaging in discussions with Participant regarding the Participation), the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n1. The term \""Representatives\"" means each party's affiliates and such party's and its affiliates' directors, officers, partners, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, legal counsel and accountants), and the term \""person\"" shall include any corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company, trust, governmental entity or individual.\n2. (a) Participant agrees that Participant will (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purposes of the Participation, (ii) not, directly or indirectly, use, disseminate, disclose, discuss or reveal any Evaluation Material, and (iii) otherwise treat and maintain in full confidence all Evaluation Material.\n(b) Participant agrees that Participant will not disclose to any person (including other possible bidders for Target and employees, customers and suppliers of Target) that the Evaluation Material has been made available to Participant, that Participant has inspected any portion thereof, the fact that Originator is considering a possible Transaction, that discussions are or may take place regarding a possible Transaction, that Originator and Participant are considering or discussing Participant's possible participation in a Transaction, or any other information regarding a possible Transaction, including the status thereof.\n(c) Neither Participant nor its Representatives shall initiate any communications with any Representative of Target concerning the Evaluation Material without Originator's prior written consent.\n(d) \""Evaluation Material\"" shall not include any information which Participant can demonstrate (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Participant or its Representatives, or (ii) was or becomes available to Participant or its Representatives on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Originator or its Representatives or Target or its representatives (provided that such source is not known by participant to be bound by a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary obligation prohibiting or otherwise restricting the disclosure of such information) or (iii) is required by law, legal process or any applicable government agency or court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be disclosed.\n(e) The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to disclosures by Participant to its Representatives to whom disclosure is required in order to permit Participant to evaluate its participation in a possible Transaction and to whom disclosure is made for the purposes of such evaluation; provided that prior to making any such disclosure, Participant shall apprise its Representatives of the confidential nature of such matters and the obligations of Participant hereunder. Participant shall in any event be liable to Originator for any actions by such persons which would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Participant.\n(f) In the event that Participant or any Representative of Participant is requested or becomes legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories; requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demands or similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or take any other action prohibited by this Agreement, Participant shall, to the extent practicable, provide Originator with prompt written notice thereof (in reasonable detail) so that Originator may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, Participant shall furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material or take only such action as is legally required by law or binding order.\n3. In the event that a Transaction is not consummated and upon originator's written request, or otherwise upon Originator's written request, all Evaluation Material supplied by Originator, Target or their respective Representatives (and all copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part thereof, whether prepared by Originator or any of its Representatives or any other person) shall be returned to Originator or, with the Originator's written permission, destroyed and not retained by Participant or its Representatives in any form or for any reason except as required by law or regulations. This provision applies to all documents, memoranda, notes, computer programs and data bases and other writings whatsoever prepared by Participant or its Representatives based on, containing or otherwise reflecting the Evaluation Material.\n4. To the extent the Evaluation Material includes or otherwise involves intellectual property, technical data, technology, processes, applications for patents, trade secrets or know-how, disclosure thereof to Participant or its Representatives by or on behalf of Originator, Target or any of their respective Representatives shall not be construed as the grant of any license or of any right to use the same, except for the sole purpose of evaluating and completing a potential Transaction.\n5. Participant hereby covenants and agrees that for a period of eighteen months following the date hereof, it shall not, without the prior written consent of Originator (which will not be unreasonably withheld) directly or indirectly:\n(a) enter into negotiations, provide advice, provide any form of financial assistance (including, without limitation, debt or equity investments) or otherwise encourage, facilitate or consummate any transaction involving Target (whether structured as an investment, a purchase or assets, a purchase of debt or equity interests (including, without limitation, options, warrants or other securities or instruments convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for debt or equity interests or equity appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar instruments or rights containing equity-like features), a merger, consolidation, combination, recapitalization, refinancing, restructuring, reorganization or otherwise) without the prior express written consent of Originator; or\n(b) initiate discussions with respect to the prospective employment of, or hire for employment, any employees of Target or any subsidiary thereof.\n6. Participant acknowledges and agrees that neither Originator nor any Representative of Originator makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material. Any representations or warranties with respect to Originator, Target or otherwise made in connection with the consummation of a potential Transaction shall be contained only in a definitive agreement, if any, to which Participant and Originator are parties. Originator and its Representatives expect that Participant shall conduct its own independent investigation and analysis of Target and a potential Transaction, and you agree that neither Originator nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to Participant or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material supplied by Originator, Target or any of its Representatives.\n7. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate Participant to enter into any transaction or arrangement with Originator or Target, and Originator shall be entitled to terminate the Participation and to demand the return or destruction of all Evaluation Materials by Participant at any time without limiting Participant's obligations hereunder.\n8. Participant acknowledges and affirms that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it and that Originator shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Participant has breached this Agreement, then Participant shall be liable for and shall pay to Originator the reasonable legal fees and expenses and court costs incurred by Originator in connection with any such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n9. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be deemed affected, impaired or invalidated.\n10. This Agreement may not be amended or waived, in whole or in part, except with the written consent of Originator and Participant. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by Originator in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver hereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.\n11. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of New York State.\n12. The language used herein shall be deemed to be the language mutually chosen by the parties hereto to express their intent and understanding, and no doctrine of construction shall be applied against either party.\n13. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and both of which together shall be deemed to constitute one fully-executed Agreement.\n14. This agreement shall expire upon the earlier of the date the Transaction is consummated or eighteen months from the date hereof.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\nOriginator:\nJD Holdings, LLC\nBy: /s/ Jonathan D.

NON-COMPETITION COVENANT.\nThe Selling Shareholder acknowledges (i) as an [director,] officer and principal shareholder of SAI, he has been instrumental in the Business of SAI and its success and (ii) has been privy to and had access to the offices, personnel, technology, confidential and proprietary information of SAI.\n1.1 Selling Shareholder agrees, during the period ending five years from the Effective Time (\""Restricted Period\""), neither Selling Shareholder nor any affiliate of Selling Shareholder shall conduct any of the following activities described in Sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3:\n1.1.1 engage in Restricted Activities within the Restricted Area (as defined below); or\n1.1.2 operate or promote within the Restricted Area a store using (or at least a 500 square foot area within a store dedicated to) a single price point retail concept selling goods at a single price point at or below $2.00; or\n1.1.3 operate any variety, clearance, or close-out retail store in the same shopping center as any retail location of SAI existing as of the Effective Time or, in the case of an existing store of SAI not in a\nshopping center, within one-quarter mile of such retail location. 1.2 Selling Shareholder agrees that, at no time after the Effective Time for so long as Dollar Tree or its successors carry on the Business, shall Selling Shareholder or Selling Shareholder's Affiliates operate any business (a) under the names or names similar to \""98 CENTS Clearance Center,\"" \""Clearance 98 CENTS Centers,\"" \""Everything 98 CENTS ... or less,\"" or \""Step Ahead Investments\""; (b) advertise or promote outside or within a store using the terms, or terms similar to \""Everything 98 CENTS,\"" 98 CENTS Clearance Centers,\"" and \""Clearance 98 CENTS Centers\""; or (c) under any name containing the words \""98 CENTS,\"" \""Tree,\"" or \""Super Dollar,\"" including their plurals. 1.3 As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:\n1.3.1 a. While Selling Shareholder is a resident of California, \""Restricted Area\"" shall mean all counties and cities in the States of California and Nevada in which SAI, as of the Effective Time, carries on the Business. The covenant not to compete in the Restricted Area shall be construed as a series of separate covenants with regard to such city or county in the States of California and in Nevada.\nb. If Selling Shareholder ceases to be a resident of California, immediately upon Selling Shareholder's change of residency \""Restricted Area\"" shall mean each state in which either Dollar Tree or SAI, as of the Effective Time, has a store or otherwise carries on the Business. The covenant not to compete in the Restricted Area shall be viewed as a series of separate covenants with regard to each state where either Dollar Tree or SAI carries on the Business.\n1.3.2 \""Restricted Activities\"" means the operation of (i) a wholesale merchandise business that supplies stores of the type described in clause (ii) hereof, or (ii) any store engaged in the retail sale of goods (e.g., toys, health and beauty aids, food, books, party goods, stationery, hardware, housewares, jewelry, hair products, crafts, pet supplies, etc.) where at least eighty percent (80%) of such goods are sold at or below $2.00.\n1.3.3 A \""shopping center\"" means a group of at least six (6) retail shops organized in a strip or mall configuration (but not necessarily in attached or adjacent buildings) sharing common parking areas and having the same landlord or leasing agent.\n1.4 Selling Shareholder agrees that the restrictions in Section 1 are reasonable and necessary to protect the value of Dollar Tree, including the good will associated therewith, and do not unduly restrict Selling Shareholder's ability to earn a livelihood.\n2. NO SOLICITATION AND NO HIRE OF EMPLOYEES. Unless the parties hereto otherwise agree, Selling Shareholder agrees that from July 22, 1998 until the end of the Restricted Period, Selling Shareholder has not and shall not, directly or indirectly, hire or attempt to hire any employee of Dollar Tree or SAI, or solicit, induce, or attempt to solicit or induce (other than through newspaper classified advertisements) any employee of Dollar Tree or SAI to leave his or her job for any reason whatsoever without the written consent of Dollar Tree. For purposes of this paragraph, an \""employee\"" shall mean, as of any given date, anyone who has been an employee of Dollar Tree or SAI or any affiliate at any time during the four (4) month period prior to such date.\n3. RETURN OF PROPERTY.

NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Selling Shareholder shall not, without the prior written approval of Dollar Tree, at any time copy, reproduce, disclose or divulge to any third party, use or permit others to use any confidential information of SAI or Dollar Tree (including financial information, sources of supplies and materials, prospective and existing expansion programs, joint ventures and affiliate agreements, business systems and marketing methods, and all business affairs). During the Restricted Period, Selling Shareholder shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall not use for the benefit of Selling Shareholder, Selling Shareholder's affiliate, or others, all confidential matters of the Business or of Dollar Tree, including trade secrets, details of supplier contracts, lease provisions and terms, operational methods and marketing plans or strategies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein contained shall preclude Selling Shareholder from using the confidential information described in this Section 4 in the operation of or in the leasing of any real property or the operation of any business in connection with a business not coming within the definition of Restricted Activities or for other personal use, so long as such use does not conflict with any provision of this Agreement. This Section 4 shall not apply if (a) such information is already known to such party or to others not bound by a duty of confidentiality or such information is or becomes publicly available through no fault of Selling Shareholder or Selling Shareholder's Affiliates, (b) the use of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or obtaining any consent or approval required for the consummation of the closing under the Merger Agreement, or (c) the furnishing or use of such information is required by legal proceedings.\n5. COOPERATION. Selling Shareholder agrees to cooperate in any reasonable manner with any reasonable requests by Dollar Tree from time to time to verify compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, provided, however, Dollar Tree shall reimburse Selling Shareholder for Selling Shareholder's reasonable out-of-pocket costs in complying with such request.\n6.

Selling Shareholder agrees that the restrictions contained in Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 above shall apply to any direct or indirect activities of Selling Shareholder whether conducted as (i) an individual, (ii) a partner (limited or otherwise) or joint venturer with any other person or entity, (iii) an employee, agent or representative of any other person or entity, (iv) as an officer, director or shareholder of any corporation (other than the ownership of less than 5% of the interests in a publicly traded entity), or (v) as a member or manager of any limited liability company (other than the ownership of less than 5% of the interests in a publicly traded entity).\n6.2. As used herein, the term \""affiliate\"" with respect to any person shall mean any person or entity which controls such person, which that person controls, or which is under common control with that person. In the case of Selling Shareholder, the term \""affiliate\"" shall include the spouse, sibling, or lineal descendant or ancestor of Selling Shareholder, a trust for the benefit of any of the preceding, or any corporation, partnership, joint venture, or other entity which the Selling Shareholder, the spouse, sibling, or lineal descendant or ancestor of Selling Shareholder, or a trust for the benefit of any of the preceding, controls. For purposes of the preceding sentences, the term \""control\"" means the power, direct or indirect through one or more intermediaries, to direct or cause to the direction of the management and policies of a person or entity through voting securities, contract, or otherwise.\n7. INJUNCTION; REMEDIES. The Selling Shareholder acknowledges that Dollar Tree shall have no adequate remedy at law and that irreparable injury may result to Dollar Tree in the event Selling Shareholder violates or breaches any of the above agreements, covenants, or restrictions. Therefore, it is hereby agreed that upon any breach of any of the above covenants, agreements, or restrictions, Dollar Tree shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available, to an injunction to restrain the violation or breach of any of the terms of such covenants, agreements, or restrictions by Selling Shareholder, and that no bond shall be required in procuring any such injunction. In addition, if any party files suit to enforce its rights under this Agreement and prevails, the other party agrees to reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable costs and fees, including any reasonable attorney's fees the prevailing party incurs. The court shall determine who is the prevailing party for purposes of the preceding sentence. The foregoing remedies for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedies Dollar Tree may have at law or in equity in the event of breach.\n8. ENFORCEABILITY.\n8.1 Selling Shareholder has examined this Agreement in detail, understands the nature of the burdens imposed by this Agreement, and is entering into this Agreement on Selling Shareholder's own volition. Selling Shareholder has been encouraged by Dollar Tree to have this Agreement reviewed by Selling Shareholder's independent legal counsel and has had adequate opportunity to do so. Selling Shareholder agrees that the restrictions, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement are (i) reasonable in all respects (including, without limitation, geographic area and duration), (ii) necessary to protect the value of Dollar Tree, and (iii) are not unduly harsh upon Selling Shareholder's ability to earn a livelihood. Selling Shareholder represents that upon careful review, Selling Shareholder knows of no reason why any agreement, covenant, or restriction contained in this Agreement is not reasonable and enforceable.\n8.2 If any provision of this Agreement shall be found by any arbitration panel or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be replaced by such panel or court by a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of the invalid or unenforceable provision and, as modified, shall be enforced as any other provision hereof, all other provisions continuing in full force and effect to the maximum extent possible. The enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.\n9. NON-DISPARAGEMENT. From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Selling Shareholder shall not make any material public statement, representation or communication of any sort, whether oral, in writing, or by any other medium, which disparages Dollar Tree, its directors, officers, shareholders, partners, employees, products, services or financial condition.\n10. NO DEFENSE. The existence of any claim or cause of action of the Selling Shareholder against Dollar Tree, whether predicated on this Agreement or not, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Dollar Tree of the restrictions, covenants and agreements contained herein.\n11. AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented only by written agreement of Selling Shareholder and Dollar Tree at any time.\n12. WAIVER OF COMPLIANCE; CONSENTS. Any failure of the Selling Shareholder to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived only by a writing signed by Dollar Tree only and such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.\n13.

All claims, notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made (i) upon receipt when delivered by hand or sent by overnight delivery by a nationally recognized private courier, (ii) upon receipt for notices delivered by facsimile or (iii) three (3) business days after being mailed, first class, certified mail, return receipt requested, with postage prepaid:\n13.1 If to the Selling Shareholder, to:\n[Insert address]\nwith a required copy to:\nLatham & Watkins\n505 Montgomery Street, Suite 1900\nSan Francisco, California 94111\nAttention: Tracy Edmonson, Esquire\nTelecopier: 415-395-8095\nor to such other person or address as any of the Selling Shareholder shall furnish to Dollar Tree.\n13.2 If to Dollar Tree to:\nDollar Tree Stores, Inc.\n500 Volvo Parkway\nChesapeake, Virginia 23320\nAttention: Mr. H.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (this \""AGREEMENT\"") is entered into as of September 20, 1999 (the \""EFFECTIVE DATE\"") by and between Premisys Communications, Inc. (\""PREMISYS\"") and Zhone Corporation (\""RECIPIENT\"").\nThe parties desire to pursue certain business discussions solely for the purpose (the \""BUSINESS PURPOSE\"") of evaluating a possible business transaction between themselves, including discussions regarding (i) the strategic importance and value of Premisys or any of its products or technology to Recipient's business, and (ii) the possible structures of any business transaction between Premisys and Recipient. In connection with such discussions, Premisys may elect to make available and disclose to Recipient certain of its confidential information solely for the Business Purpose.\nAccordingly, in consideration of the disclosure of any such confidential information by Premisys to Recipient, and the mutual agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and in order to facilitate the evaluation of the possible business transaction described above, the parties agree as follows:\n1. DEFINITION OF \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. As used in this Agreement, \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\"" means all information disclosed by Premisys or its agents to Recipient (or to Recipient's attorneys, accountants or other professional advisors, collectively, its \""REPRESENTATIVES\"") in connection with the Business Purpose, including without limitation, information regarding Premisys' products, computer software, technology, agreements, customers, suppliers, financial condition, business plans or strategies and also includes all information contained in any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by Recipient or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by Premisys or its agents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Confidential Information will NOT include information that:\n(a) is as of the Effective Date, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of Recipient, generally known or readily ascertainable through proper means to persons knowledgeable in the relevant industry;\n(b) was acquired by Recipient by proper means without restriction as to use or disclosure BEFORE receiving such information from Premisys;\n(c) is hereafter rightfully furnished to Recipient by a third party, without restriction as to use or disclosure; or\n(d) was independently developed by Recipient without use of Premisys' Confidential Information.\n2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE. Recipient agrees: (a) to hold Premisys' Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties (other than on a confidential basis to its Representatives in furtherance of the Business Purpose); and (c) not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose except for the Business Purpose. Recipient may disclose Premisys' Confidential Information to its employees with a bona fide need to know, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to carry out the Business Purpose. Recipient agrees to instruct all such employees that they may not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Business Purpose and (except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement) not to disclose such Confidential Information to third parties, including consultants, without the prior written consent of Premisys.\n3. NON-DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTION. Recipient will not, without the prior written consent of Premisys, disclose to any third party (except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement) the fact that any Confidential Information has been disclosed hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Recipient (and its Representatives) may make such disclosure if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for such party, such disclosure is required by law, regulation or any stock exchange or the Nasdaq National Market.\n4. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. In the event that Recipient or any of its Representatives is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information of Premisys, Recipient shall provide Premisys with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that Premisys may seek a protective order, confidential treatment or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order, confidential treatment or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Premisys, Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required to make the disclosure and, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel for Recipient, legally compelled to disclose Premisys' Confidential Information to any court, tribunal or agency or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal or agency only that portion of Premisys' Confidential Information which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that Recipient and its Representative exercise their best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of Premisys' Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with Premisys to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded Premisys' Confidential Information by such tribunal or agency.\n5. RETURN/DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Premisys may, at any time, deliver written notice (a \""TERMINATION NOTICE\"") to Recipient of Premisys' election to have all tangible materials (including without limitation paper and magnetic storage media) in the possession of Recipient (or its Representatives) which contain, reflect, are based upon or derived from, in whole or in part, any of Premisys' Confidential Information (\""CONFIDENTIAL MATERIALS\"") either returned to Premisys or, at Premisys' election, destroyed. Upon receipt of a Termination Notice, Recipient shall, within twenty (20) calendar days, either: (i) return the Confidential Materials in its possession to Premisys and instruct its Representatives to do the same; (ii) destroy the Confidential Materials in a secure manner and instruct its Representatives to do the same; or (iii) at Premisys' election, take any combination of steps (i) and (ii). Prior to the expiration of the foregoing twenty (20) period, Recipient shall certify in writing to Premisys that it has complied with its obligations under this Section 5 (a \""COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE\""). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, if Recipient receives a Termination Notice, it shall not be required to return or destroy Confidential Materials to the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel for such party, such return or destruction violates any law or regulation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in such event Recipient shall describe in its Compliance Certificate the extent to which it is not returning or destroying Confidential Materials. Notwithstanding any return or destruction of Confidential Materials, Recipient will continue to be bound by its obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information contained or reflected in such Confidential Materials.\n6. NO LICENSE OR OTHER RIGHTS. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights to Recipient, by license or otherwise, to any of Premisys' Confidential Information except as expressly specified in this Agreement.\n7. NO REPRESENTATION OF ACCURACY. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that Premisys makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information disclosed to Recipient in connection with the Business Purpose. Recipient agrees that neither Premisys nor its agents, shall have any liability to Recipient or its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations and warranties which are made in the final definitive agreement between the parties hereto regarding any transactions contemplated hereby, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n8. NO OBLIGATION REGARDING BUSINESS PURPOSE. Each party acknowledges that (i) neither party will be under any obligation of any kind by virtue of this Agreement to enter into any agreement relating to the Business Purpose or the possible transaction referred to herein and (ii) unless and until a binding written agreement to the contrary is executed and delivered by the parties hereto, each party reserves the absolute right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party with regard to any possible transaction relating to the Business Purpose and to terminate discussions relating to such a possible transaction at any time.\n9. NONSOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Beginning on Effective Date and continuing for a period of six months thereafter, Recipient will not, either for itself or for any other person or entity, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce or attempt to induce any employee of Premisys to terminate his or her employment with Premisys. The parties agree that general solicitation or recruitment of prospective employees through newspaper advertising or job fairs shall not be deemed a violation of this provision.\n10. STANDSTILL. Beginning on the Effective Date and continuing for a period of one (1) year thereafter, neither Recipient nor any of its affiliates will (and neither party nor any of its affiliates will assist or encourage others to), directly or indirectly, unless specifically requested to do so in writing in advance by Premisys' Board of Directors:\n(a) acquire or agree, offer, seek or propose to acquire, or cause to be acquired, ownership (including, but not limited to, beneficial ownership as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \""EXCHANGE ACT\"")) of any of Premisys' assets or businesses or any securities issued by Premisys, or any rights or options to acquire such ownership, including from a third party; or\n(b) make, or in any way participate, in any solicitation of proxies or consents with respect to any securities of Premisys which are, or may be, entitled to vote in the election of Premisys' directors (\""VOTING SECURITIES\""), become a \""participant\"" in any \""election contest\"" (as such terms are defined or used in Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act) with respect to Premisys; or seek to advise, encourage or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of any Voting Securities; or demand a copy of Premisys' stock ledger, list of its stockholders or other books and records; or call or attempt to call any meeting of the stockholders of Premisys; or\n(c) form, join, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in a \""group\"" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act with respect to any securities of Premisys.\n11. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES. Recipient acknowledges that any violation of the terms of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Premisys will have the right to obtain equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, as a remedy for any breach of the terms of this Agreement, as well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach. In the event of litigation arising from or relating to this Agreement, the party which is found to be the prevailing party by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable order shall receive from the non-prevailing party the reasonable legal fees and expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n12. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE. The internal laws of the State of California (irrespective of its choice of law principles) will govern the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in connection with any litigation of a dispute between them arising from or relating to this Agreement and waives any and all right to object to the jurisdiction of such court or to claim that venue in such court is not proper.\n13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties with respect to such subject matter.\n14. AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended only by the written consent of each of the parties hereto. The observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed by the party to be bound by such waiver. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default.\n15. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be an original as regards any party whose signature appears thereon and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement will become binding when one or more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, will bear the signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement by their duly authorized officers or representatives.\nPREMISYS COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

"      EXHIBIT \""H\""\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nContract No. [***]\nMUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the \""Agreement\"") made this ____ day of ____ , 199__ (the \""Effective Date\"") between FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (\""Federal\"") and INTERNATIONAL BILLING SERVICES, INC (\""IBS\"").\nRECITALS\n1. Federal and IBS have each developed certain confidential and proprietary information (\""Federal's Confidential Information\"" or \""IBS's Confidential Information\"") including, but not limited to, financial statements, financing documents, trade secrets, new products, copyrights, computer software, documentation, specifications, systems, hardware, concepts, designs, configurations, schedules, costs, performance features, techniques, copyrighted matter, patentable and patented inventions, plans, methods, drawings, data, tables, calculations, documents or other paperwork, computer program narratives, flow charts, source and object codes, business and marketing plans, dealings, arrangements, objectives, locations and customer information.\n2. In order to discuss the pursuit of a business relationship, Federal and IBS recognize the need for disclosure of Federal's Confidential Information to IBS, and of IBS's Confidential Information to Federal.\n3. Federal is willing to disclose its Confidential Information to IBS and IBS is willing to disclose its Confidential Information to Federal pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.\nFOR AND IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement,\nFederal and IBS (individually a \""Party\"" and collectively the \""Parties\"") agree as follows:\nSection 1. Confidentiality of Information. (a) Each party acknowledges that all Confidential Information which has or will come into its possession or knowledge after the Effective Date in connection with business discussions, conferences or other activities in pursuit of a business relationship between Federal and IBS:\n(i) is proprietary to the disclosing party, having been designed, developed or accumulated by the disclosing party at a great expense and over lengthy periods of time and\n*** Portions of this exhibit have been redacted pursuant to a Confidential Treatment Request.\n(ii) is secret, confidential and unique, and constitutes the exclusive property of the disclosing party. Each party acknowledges that any disclosure of the other's Confidential Information other than for the benefit of the other party will be wrongful and will cause irreparable injury to the other party and, therefore, each party agrees to hold the other's Confidential information in strictest confidence and not to make use of it other than for the benefit of the other party.\n(b) Information shall be deemed \""Confidential Information\"" and shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement if:\n(i) the party to which such information is being disclosed is notified that the information is confidential or proprietary prior to its disclosure; or\n(ii) information in a tangible form is labeled as confidential or proprietary prior to its disclosure; or\n(iii) the party to which such information is being disclosed knows that such information is confidential or proprietary or would be reasonably expected to understand the confidential or proprietary nature of such information.\nSection 2. Non-Disclosure to Third Parties. Neither party shall communicate the other's Confidential Information in any form to any third party without the other party's prior written consent and each party shall use its best efforts to prevent inadvertent disclosure of the other's Confidential Information to any third party. Any Confidential Information disclosed to a third party pursuant to this Section shall be provided pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement between the party providing the information and the third party, which non-disclosure agreement shall substantially conform to this Agreement. In addition, the parties agree that they will conform to the provisions of applicable securities laws in connection with their use of the Confidential Information.\nSection 3. Authorized Disclosure. The parties acknowledge that in order to enable them to discuss pursuit of a business relationship each may be required to disseminate the other party's Confidential Information to various of its employees. Each party undertakes to cause any of its employees to whom such Confidential Information is transmitted to be bound to the same obligation of secrecy and confidentiality to which the parties are bound under this Agreement.\nSection 4. Survival of Terms. The obligations of this Agreement shall terminate with respect to any particular portion of a party's Confidential Information:\n(i) if either party can show that the Confidential Information received from the other is or has become generally available to the public through no violation of the terms of this Agreement;\n*** Portions of this exhibit have been redacted pursuant to a Confidential Treatment Request.\n(ii) if either party can show that such Confidential Information is in a written record in such party's files prior to receipt from the other party;\n(iii) if either party at any time lawfully obtains such Confidential Information in writing from a third party under circumstances permitting its disclosure;\n(iv) if such Confidential Information is disclosed with the prior written consent of the party to whom such Confidential Information belongs, provided that any disclosure complies in all respects with the terms of such written consent; or\n(v) if such Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement of a governmental agency or required by operation of law; provided that the party to whom such Confidential Information belongs shall be given written notice prior to such disclosure and such disclosure shall be permitted only to the extent required by law.\nOtherwise, the obligations of this Agreement with respect to either party's Confidential Information shall terminate on the later of (i) three (3) years after the Expiration Date (or earlier termination date) of this Agreement as set forth in Section 5 hereof, or (ii) in the event there are\nany contracts or agreements between the parties which are entered into in connection with information disclosed under this Agreement, three (3) years after the date of termination or expiration of all such contracts and agreements between the parties.\nSection 5.

All information (i) about the Disclosing Party or (ii) about a third party (which information was provided to the Disclosing Party subject to a confidentiality agreement with such third party) furnished by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the Receiving Party or its Representatives, whether furnished before or after the date hereof in connection with the Proposed Transaction, and regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, is referred to in this letter agreement as \""Evaluation Material.\"" Evaluation Material shall not include, however, information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of this letter agreement; (ii) was available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives; (iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis from a person other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, or is otherwise not known to the Receiving Party to be under an obligation to the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives not to transmit the information to the Receiving Party; or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to or use of the Evaluation Material. For purposes of this letter agreement, (i) \""Representative\"" shall mean, as to any person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys and accountants) and debt and equity financing sources and their advisors and Representatives (but shall not include any debt and equity financing sources that enter into a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to the Disclosing Party, which either names Disclosing Party as a third party beneficiary or to which Disclosing Party is made a party, and an executed copy of which is provided to Disclosing Party); and (ii) \""person\"" shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.\nSubject to the immediately succeeding paragraph, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party (i) except as required by law, rule or regulation, shall keep all Evaluation Material confidential, shall not disclose or reveal any Evaluation Material to any person other than its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Evaluation Material for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction and shall cause those persons to observe the terms of this letter agreement; (ii) shall not use Evaluation Material for any purpose other than in connection with its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or the consummation of the Proposed Transaction in a manner that the Disclosing Party has approved; and (iii) except as required by law, rule or regulation, shall not disclose to any person (other than those of its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction, which Representatives it shall cause to observe the terms of this agreement,) any information about the Proposed Transaction, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Evaluation Material has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this letter agreement by it and secondarily responsible for any breach of the terms of this letter agreement by its Representatives. The parties agree that notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the existence of any discussions shall not be disclosed in any court, governmental or other similar proceeding except as expressly permitted herein.\nNotwithstanding the definition of Evaluation Material, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party from utilizing any information obtained pursuant to discovery or other mediation, arbitration, court, or administrative proceedings even though such information also was provided hereunder as Evaluation Material; provided that neither the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party shall utilize any Evaluation Material in connection with such proceeding unless acquired in such proceeding.\nIn the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, any rule, regulation or policy statement of any national securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of the Receiving Party's securities are listed or quoted) or by legal process to disclose any Evaluation Material or any other information concerning the Disclosing Party or the Proposed Transaction, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Disclosing Party (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, (ii) to consult with the Receiving Party with respect to the Receiving Party's taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process, or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this letter agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this letter agreement, the Receiving Party or its Representative shall use good faith efforts to disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which is legally required to be disclosed and to cooperate with the Disclosing Party in its efforts to obtain reliable assurance that all Evaluation Material that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment to the fullest extent available. In the event that the Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, shall have complied with the provisions of this paragraph, such disclosure may be made by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, as applicable, without any liability hereunder.\nFor a period (the \""Restricted Period\"") commencing with the date of this letter agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) 15 months after the termination of discussions between the parties with respect to a Proposed Transaction and (ii) the occurrence of a \""Significant Event\"" (as defined below), neither party hereto nor any of its Representatives shall, without the prior written consent of the other party or its board of directors or any committee thereof delegated the responsibility for such matters:\n(a) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any voting securities or direct or indirect rights to acquire any voting securities of the other party or any subsidiary of the other party, or of any successor to or person in control of the other party, or any material assets of the other party or any subsidiary or division of the other party or of any such successor or controlling person;\n(b) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in any \""solicitation\"" of \""proxies\"" to vote (as such terms are used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \""SEC\"")), or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the other party;\n(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal or offer (with or without conditions) in connection with any of the foregoing;\n(d) form, join or in any way participate in a \""group\"" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \""Exchange Act\""), in connection with any of the foregoing;\n(e) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the other party;\n(f) take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any of the events described in clauses (a) through (e) above; or (g) request the other party or any of its Representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.\nDuring the Restricted Period, each party hereto shall promptly advise the other party of any inquiry or proposal made to it with respect to any of the foregoing. For purposes of this letter agreement, (i) \""Significant Event\"" shall mean, with respect to each of the parties hereto, any of (A) the acquisition by any person or \""13D Group\"" (as defined below) of beneficial ownership of \""Voting Securities\"" (as defined below) of such party representing 15% or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities of such party; (B) the announcement or commencement by any person or 13D Group of a tender or exchange offer to acquire Voting Securities of such party which, if successful, would result in such person or 13D Group owning, when combined with any other Voting Securities of such party owned by such person or 13D Group, 15% or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities of such party; or (C) the entry into by such party, or determination by such party to seek to enter into, any merger, sale or other business combination transaction pursuant to which the outstanding shares of common stock of such party would be converted into cash or securities of another person or 13D Group or 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of common stock of such party would be owned by persons other than the then current holders of shares of common stock of such party, or which would result in all or a substantial portion of such party's assets being sold to any person or 13D Group; (ii) \""Voting Securities\"" shall mean, with respect to each party hereto, at any time shares of any class of capital stock of such party which are then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; provided, that for purposes of this definition any securities which at such time are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of common stock of such party shall be deemed to have been so converted, exchanged or exercised; and (iii) \""13D Group\"" shall mean, with respect to the Voting Securities of each party hereto, any group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of such Voting Securities which would required under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder to file a statement on Schedule 13D with the SEC as a \""person\"" within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act if such group beneficially owned Voting Securities representing more than 5% of the total combined voting power of all such Voting Securities then outstanding.\nFor a period of two (2) years subsequent to the termination of discussions between the parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, neither party shall, without prior written consent of the other party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire, any person currently employed by the other party (or any of its subsidiaries); provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring party or (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other party.\nTo the extent that any Evaluation Material may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by a party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges to the fullest extent available under applicable law. Nothing in this letter agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.\nIf either party hereto shall determine that it does not wish to proceed with the Proposed Transaction, such party shall promptly advise the other party of that decision. In that case, or in the event that the Disclosing Party, in its sole discretion, so requests or the Proposed Transaction is not consummated by the Receiving Party, the Receiving party shall, upon the Disclosing Party's written request, promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party all Evaluation Material, and, at the Receiving Party's election, return or destroy (provided that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of the Receiving Party) all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof, including any electronic or computer file copies, or based thereon in the Receiving Party's possession or in the possession of any Representative of the Receiving Party.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction and without prejudice thereto, each party hereto acknowledges that neither it nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Evaluation Material. The Receiving Party shall not be entitled to rely on the completeness of any Evaluation Material, but shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties regarding the completeness of the Evaluation Material as may be made to it in any definitive agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement.\nUntil a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction has been executed by the parties hereto and subject to the terms and conditions of that certain letter agreement dated as of March 17, 2001 between the company and the Interested Party (the \""Exclusivity Agreement\""), neither party hereto shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Proposed Transaction by virtue of this letter agreement or otherwise (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Exclusivity Agreement, each party hereto and its Representatives (i) may conduct the process that may or may not result in the Proposed Transaction in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party) and (ii) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to such other party) the procedures relating to the consideration of the Proposed Transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party and requesting that such other party return or destroy the Evaluation Material as described above).\nWithout prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either party hereto, each party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the other party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this letter agreement. In the event of litigation relating to this letter agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final order from which there is no appeal that this letter agreement has been breached by a party or by its Representatives, the breaching party or the party whose Representatives have breached this letter agreement, as the case may be, will reimburse the other party for its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this letter agreement and such litigation.\nIt is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\nThis letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, other than such principles directing application of Texas law.\nThis letter agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto concerning confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and no modification of this letter agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon either party hereto, unless approved in writing by each such party. This letter agreement supersedes and replaces the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated January 25, 2000 entered into previously between the parties; provided that the restrictions imposed by such previous letter agreement shall remain in effect for periods prior to the date hereof.\nPlease confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning to the undersigned the duplicate copy of this letter enclosed herewith.\nDTM CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Anthony Mariotti\n--------------------------------------------\nName: Anthony Mariotti\nTitle: Director, Member of Special Committee\nACCEPTED AND AGREED as of the date hereof:\n3D SYSTEMS CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Brian K.
