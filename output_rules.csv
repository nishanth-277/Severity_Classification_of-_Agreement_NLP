WHEREAS, the Parties have entered into a transaction related to the _______________________. The terms of those agreements are incorporated herein.
JEA & Florida State Sunshine Application - JEA is a publicly owned utility and all official information sharing is governed by Florida Sunshine Laws. The Florida Sunshine law is a series of laws designed to guarantee that the public has access to the public records of governmental bodies in Florida. However, as per the Florida Sunshine Law, certain information that could impact safe and secure operation is exempt which includes information classified and protected under federal regulatory standards such as NERC CIP, HIPAA, FCRA, and FACTA. Section 119.0713(4)(a), 5(a), F.S. govern any local government agency exemptions from inspection or copying of public records and exempts certain information including Security measures, systems, or procedures from public disclosure including -
I. Information related to the security of the technology, processes, or practices of a utility owned or operated by a unit of local government that are designed to protect the utility's networks, computers, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access, which information, if disclosed, would facilitate the alteration, disclosure, or destruction of such data or information technology resources.
II. Information related to the security of existing or proposed information technology systems or industrial control technology systems of a utility owned or operated by a unit of local government, which, if disclosed, would facilitate unauthorized access to, and alteration or destruction of, such systems in a manner that would adversely impact the safe and reliable operation of the systems and the utility.
III. Results of periodic internal audits and evaluations of the security program for an agency's data and information technology resources are confidential and exempt.
This agreement applies to disclosure of the protected information that is exempt from Florida Sunshine Law disclosure and in no shape or manner would this agreement supersede the provisions of Florida Sunshine Law.

II. Such discussions may involve disclosure by one party to the other party of confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of its own or its licensors (“Confidential Information” as defined below), during the Period for Exchange of Information.
III. Both parties recognize the value of the Confidential Information and that it is in their mutual best interests to maintain the confidential, proprietary and secret nature of the Confidential Information.
THEREFORE, in consideration of the Subject Matter, and the mutual promises herein, the parties agree as follows:
1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term “Confidential Information” as used herein means all nonpublic information relating to the Subject Matter that is disclosed by either party, its Affiliates (as defined below), or their agents (where applicable, collectively referred to as the “Disclosing Party”), directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of premises or tangible objects to the other party (the “Recipient”) that is: (i) marked confidential or proprietary, or (ii) given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure, reasonably should be deemed confidential. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to documents, drawings, models, apparatus, sketches, designs, schedules, product plans, marketing plans, technical procedures, manufacturing processes, software, prototypes, samples, methodologies, formulations, trade secrets, patent applications, know-how, experimental results, specifications and other business information.
2. PERIOD OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE. The Recipient will use Confidential Information only in connection with the Purpose as set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall use the same degree of care to avoid disclosure or use of the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential, proprietary and trade secret information, but in no case use less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient agrees to limit disclosure of Confidential Information to employees and employees of Affiliates having a specific need to know such Confidential Information for the Purpose and in the case of Affiliates only to the extent that such Affiliate is under obligation to hold such information in confidence and is made aware of these terms and conditions. Recipient will not disclose or permit access to Confidential Information to contract workers, consultants or contractors of Recipient or its Affiliates unless authorized by Disclosing Party in writing and on condition that such persons are bound by obligations of confidentiality inuring to the benefit of Disclosing Party and its Affiliates at least as restrictive as these terms and conditions. Recipient shall not without Disclosing Party’s prior written consent reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other objects which embody the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to obtain access to Disclosing Party’s trade secrets and to the extent such consent is granted Recipient shall receive and hold such Confidential Information subject to the terms of this Agreement.
3. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall be for the Period of Exchange set forth above. Confidentiality obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement for the Period of Confidentiality set forth above unless the Confidential Information is a trade secret, in which case the confidentiality obligations shall continue for as long as the information is a trade secret. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice.
4. NOTICE OF UNAUTHORIZED USE. Recipient shall provide written notice to Disclosing Party without undue delay of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information which may come to the attention of Recipient. The Recipient shall cooperate with and aid the Disclosing Party in mitigating and preventing the unauthorized use and disclosure and any furtherance thereof.
5. EXCLUSIONS AND EXEMPTIONS. Recipient shall have no obligation of confidentiality with respect to any information which:
5.1. is already known or in the possession of Recipient or its Affiliate at the time of disclosure as shown by the Recipient’s and/or its Affiliates´ files and records prior to the time of disclosure, otherwise than as a result of any improper act or omission of Recipient or its Affiliate; or
5.2. is or becomes public knowledge through no wrongful act of Recipient; or
5.3. is rightfully acquired from others who did not obtain it under obligation of confidentiality; or
5.4. is independently developed by an employee, agent or consultant of Recipient without reference to the Confidential Information; or
5.5. is approved for release by written authorization from Disclosing Party.
5.6. The Recipient is hereby notified that, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §1833(b), he/she does not have criminal or civil liability under U.S. trade secret law for the following disclosures of a trade secret:
5.6.1. disclosure in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, provided the disclosure is for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; and/or
5.6.2. disclosure in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal; and/or
5.6.3. under those circumstances where Recipient files a lawsuit for retaliation against the Disclosing Party for reporting a suspected violation of law, Recipient may disclose the Disclosing Party’s trade secret information to its attorney and may use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Recipient files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
6. REPRODUCTION AND RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party shall not be copied or reproduced without the Disclosing Party’s prior written permission, except for such copies as may reasonably be required for the purpose as set forth in Section I of this Agreement. Disclosing Party may serve written request on Recipient for return or destruction of its Confidential Information at any time up to six (6) months after the termination or expiry of this Agreement and Recipient shall, within thirty (30) days of such request or termination, return to the Disclosing Party (or its designees) or certify as destroyed all Confidential Information, in whatever form, including written or electronically recorded information and all copies thereof (other than copies retained in automatic back-up and archive systems), provided however that Recipient shall be entitled to retain one copy of the Confidential Information with its legal counsel or other appropriate corporate representative to evidence the exchange of information hereunder and in connection with legal or statutory requirements. All such retained copies shall remain subject to the use and disclosure restrictions in this Agreement.
7. DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY LAW. If Recipient is requested, ordered or required by a regulatory agency or any other government authority or a court to disclose any Confidential Information, Recipient shall promptly notify Disclosing Party of such request, order or requirement so that Disclosing Party may have the opportunity to contest the disclosure, including seeking a protective order, or waive Recipient’s compliance with this Agreement. If Recipient is (in the opinion of its counsel) compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, or else be liable for contempt or other penalty or be subject to claims from a third party, Recipient may disclose such Confidential Information without liability under this Agreement.
8. EXPORT LAWS. Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any of the Confidential Information to any country, person or entity which the US Government, at the time of export, requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. The Recipient shall first obtain the written consent of Disclosing Party prior to submitting any request for authority to export such Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, export occurs when Confidential Information is transferred from one country to another by any means, including but not limited to physical shipments, FTP file transfers, e-mails, faxes, oral transfers or remote server access and an export may also occur when Confidential Information is transferred to or accessed by a person who is neither a citizen nor permanent resident of the country in which such transfer or access is taking place.

The Disclosing Party is not liable under this Agreement for any damages in connection with, related to, or arising out of the use of its Confidential Information.
12. NO OBLIGATION. This Agreement shall not be construed in any manner to be an obligation to enter into a further substantive contract or to disclose any particular Confidential Information.
13. INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENTS. Disclosing Party understands that Recipient may develop or have developed information internally, or receive or have received information from other parties that is similar to the Confidential Information.

17. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

18. CHOICE OF LAW. This Agreement is governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to principles of conflict or choice of laws. The Parties hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the State of Michigan.

"Confidentiality Agreement
This Confidentiality Agreement (the “Agreement”) has been prepared on behalf of bpost SA/NV, a limited liability company of public law, and the City of Brussels (the “Sellers”) with regard to the divestment of their respective surface areas (the “Sale”) in the Munt Center/Centre Monnaie (the “Munt”).
In consideration of the Sellers agreeing to disclose confidential information (the “Confidential Information”) to the Candidate (“Disclosee”), the latter hereby undertakes to the Sellers that as Disclosee, they will keep confidential all and any Confidential Information received at any time. The Disclosee will procure that prior to the disclosure to any other person (including any professional advisor) of any Confidential Information, such other person is made aware of the provisions of this Agreement and the fact that the Disclosee will be liable.
The Disclosee acknowledges that the Confidential Information, in as far as it relates to bpost SA/NV, could be price sensitive information and ensures compliance with the relevant legal and other provisions in this respect (including, without being limited to, the provisions of the Belgian Law of 2 August 2002 on the supervision of the financial sector and on the financial services in relation to insider dealing and market manipulation). Confidential Information shall mean the following:
a) all such information, of any kind whatsoever (whether in oral, written or electronic form, and including, but not limited to, technical, commercial, financial, accounting, legal and administrative information) pertaining to the Sale of the Munt and the Sellers as may be provided to the Disclosee and their responsible managers, officers, employees, shareholders, members of the Board of Directors and advisors (including financial, legal and tax advisors and auditors) (“Representatives”), by the Sellers, their advisors or their representatives;
b) all such analyses, compilations, forecasts, notes, memoranda and other documents as the Sellers or Deloitte Real Estate* and Laga** (the “Advisors”) may have prepared or caused to be prepared and which may contain, refer to or simply result from, the information mentioned in point (a) above;
c) the fact that the Disclosee (or any of their Representatives) are or have been involved in the analysis of, in meetings or negotiations related to the Sale, the contents, time and status of such negotiations, and generally any fact concerning the Sale.
Confidential Information shall exclude:
a) information which had become available to the public prior to the date of disclosure thereof to the Disclosee or their Representatives, or that became available to the public after such date other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Disclosee or their Representatives;
b) information which was lawfully in the Disclosee’s possession or in the possession of one or more of their Representatives prior to disclosure under this Agreement, in each case on a non-confidential basis, which, to their knowledge was free of any restriction as to its use or disclosure.
The Disclosee acknowledges that they may not approach the representatives of the Sellers and cannot contact anybody else other than the contact persons from the Advisors.
The Disclosee further undertakes and acknowledges, that neither the representatives of the Sellers nor their Advisors give any warranty or make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Confidential Information or as to the reasonableness of any assumptions on which the information is based. The Disclosee agrees that the Sellers or Advisors shall not have any liability to the Disclosee or to any of their directors, employees, advisors or agents resulting from the use of Confidential Information.
This Agreement shall in no way constitute a commitment by any person to supply any Confidential Information or enter into any contract in connection with the Sellers. The obligations of the Disclosee under this Agreement shall expire the earlier of (a) three years after the date of this Agreement, or (b) the date the Sale between the Candidate and the Sellers is completed. The obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure under this Agreement shall become effective as of the date of signing.
In the event that the Disclosee or any of its Representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information to a regulatory authority or to any other entity or third party, the Disclosee shall immediately notify the Sellers before disclosing such Confidential Information, so that the Sellers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, without prejudice to the Disclosee’s remedies under this Agreement.
It is further understood and agreed that, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which either party may have, any breach of these undertakings could cause the Sellers and/or its shareholders irreparable injury. In the event of an actual or threatened breach by the Disclosee and/or its Representatives of any provisions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall be entitled (i) to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction restraining the Disclosee and/or its Representatives from breaching the terms hereof or from disclosing any Confidential Information to any person and (ii) specific performance and other equitable relief.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Belgian law and the Parties irrevocably agree to submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Brussels. In accordance with the procedure defined in the candidacy file, we would be grateful if you could confirm your understanding and acceptance of the foregoing by returning to us a signed copy of the present document
Yours sincerely,

The confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Disclosing Party (hereinafter ""Confidential Information"") provided hereunder is any and all information, in whatever form (including electronic data) that will be disclosed to facilitate the potential transaction of business (related to the provision of SAP Services to HRM) between the Parties, including, but not limited to, portions or parts of the November 1, 2012 Agreement (including any schedules or appendices) between the Province of Nova Scotia and IBM, each Party's disclosure of intellectual property, techniques, sketches, drawings, models, inventions, know-how, processes, apparatus, equipment, algorithms, software programs, software source documents, and formulae related to the current, future and proposed products, documents and services, research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications, engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, licensing, sales or service customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandizing, and marketing plans and information. For purposes of this Agreement confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the Province’s SAP Service Provider or any other Province’s Service Provider, any parent company, subsidiary or affiliate of the Disclosing party shall be considered Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for purposes of this Agreement.
2. The term Confidential Information shall not include information, which is:
(a) in the public domain other than by a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; or
(b) rightfully received from a third party with no duty of confidentiality; or
(c) rightfully known to the Receiving Party without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the Disclosing Party; or
(d) independently developed by employees, agents or consultants of the Receiving Party; or
(e) generally made available to third parties by the Disclosing Party without restriction on disclosure.
3. The Receiving Party agrees that Confidential Information shall be used only for the purposes of facilitating the business relationship between the Parties. Additionally, subject to section 4 below, the Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall maintain the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that the Receiving Party uses to protect its own similar categories of confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. The Receiving Party shall not make any copies of Confidential Information except as necessary to perform hereunder. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by such Party, its employees, agents, officials, representatives or consultants acting within the scope of their engagement or employment.
4. The HRM acknowledges and agrees that the Province may disclose the Confidential Information received from the HRM to its external or internal auditors, as well as the Province’s SAP Service Provider or Province’s other service providers for the purpose of provision or extension of the SAP Services to HRM.
5. The Receiving Party will adhere to all Canadian export laws, rules and regulations, and will not export or re-export any technical data or products received from the Disclosing Party, nor will the receiving party export or re-export the associated products of such technical data, to any restricted country and/or to any company, individual or government entity listed in the Table of Denial Orders published from time to time by the Canadian Government (called denied persons).
6. This Agreement will be effective as of the date of this Agreement, but will apply to any Confidential Information disclosed to the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party prior to such date and will continue in perpetuity.
7. Each Party agrees that the harm resulting from improper disclosure of Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or any of its employees, agents, officials, representatives or consultants, or to enforce the terms and provisions hereof, by an action instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction, which remedy or remedies are in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy to which the Disclosing Party may be entitled at law or in equity.
8. Title to, interest in, and all other rights of ownership to Confidential Information shall remain with the Disclosing Party. The information provided hereunder, including Confidential Information, is provided strictly ""as is"" and without representation and warranty of any kind as to its accuracy, completeness, freedom from error, value, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.
9. This Agreement will terminate on the date and time the Agreement between the Parties over the provision of SAP Services is terminated. In the event this Agreement is terminated, and the Disclosing Party so requests, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy (and certify destruction of) all Confidential Information which it received from the Disclosing Party along with all copies. The obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the return of the Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party.
10. The Parties acknowledge and understand that all documentation and information, including Confidential Information, provided to the Province of Nova Scotia or HRM, as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, Province of Nova Scotia, and such other laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and Canada which may apply from time to time.
11. This Agreement shall not be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership or other form of business association between the Parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell products using or incorporating the Confidential Information, nor to create an implied or express license from either Party to the other.
12. The failure of either Party to enforce any right resulting from breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any right relating to a subsequent breach of such provision or of any other right hereunder.
13. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia and the laws of Canada applicable therein.
14. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, written or verbal, between the parties with respect to the terms set forth herein. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the respective parties.
15. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) made this ___________day of _________________, ________________ (“Effective Date”), by and between VIDAR Systems Corporation, a Virginia corporation, with offices in Herndon, Virginia (“VIDAR”), and _________________________________, a _____________________ [corporation/limited liability company/individual], whose address is ______________________________________________________ (“Receiver”).
WHEREAS, in the course of its activities with VIDAR, Receiver will receive confidential information about VIDAR, including but not limited to VIDAR’s products (hardware, software and firmware) and its design, engineering, research, development, software, marketing, manufacturing processes, pricing and business plans. Receiver has agreed to receive such information on a confidential basis and to disclose it only as provided for in this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and of other good and valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information. The term “Confidential Information” means any and all tangible and intangible information disclosed to Receiver in oral, written, graphic, recorded, photographic, any machine-readable or in any other medium or form relating to the intellectual property, management, operations, products, inventions, suppliers, customers, financials of VIDAR or any present or contemplated project, contract or relationship between VIDAR and Receiver, including without limitation, any and all plans, Intellectual Property (defined below), know-how, computer programs, software (source and object code), algorithms, computer processing systems, techniques, methodologies, formulae, compilations of information, designs, drawings, schematics, analyses, evaluations, formulations, ingredients, samples, processes, machines, prototypes, mock-ups, product performance data, proposals, job notes, reports, records, specifications, manuals, supplier and customer lists and information, licenses, the prices it obtains or has obtained for the licensing of its software products and services, purchase and sales records, marketing information or any other information concerning the business and goodwill of VIDAR and any information which is identified as being of a confidential or proprietary nature or should be considered confidential under the circumstances.
2. Receiver’s Obligations. Receiver shall: (i) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) use the Confidential Information only for the purposes as expressly directed by VIDAR; and (iii) provide such information only to those of its personnel who: (y) have a need to know the same to further VIDAR’s interests; and (z) become a party to and bound by a confidentiality agreement at least as restrictive as this Agreement prior to receiving any such information. Receiver will not disclose Confidential Information to any party who do not meet the preceding requirements. Receiver shall use the same degree of care to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of Confidential Information as it uses to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of its own proprietary information, and Receiver represents, warrants and covenants to VIDAR that such degree of care is reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.
3. Additional Disclosures. Receiver may disclose Confidential Information if the same:
(a) was generally available at the time it was disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure made by Receiver;
(b) was known to the Receiver at the time it received such information, as evidenced by contemporaneous documentation in Receiver’s files;
(c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of VIDAR;
(d) becomes known to Receiver on a non-confidential basis from a source other than VIDAR without breach of this Agreement by Receiver;
(e) is disclosed to a third party by VIDAR without restrictions against non-disclosure similar to those contained in this Agreement;
(f) is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a court; administrative agency, or other government body, provided Receiver takes all reasonable steps to keep the Confidential Information from becoming part of public records; or
(g) is hereafter independently developed by Receiver without the aid, application or use of any Confidential Information;
provided for each that: (i) Receiver promptly notifies VIDAR of such action; and (ii) in any action to enforce or remedy a breach of this Agreement, Receiver shall have the burden of establishing the applicability of the subsection on which it relies.
4. Additional Receivers. An employee, director, officer, manager, member, partner, affiliate, associate, agent, attorney, accountant, consultant, banker, business adviser, financial adviser, scientific adviser or technical adviser of Receiver may become a party to this Agreement by signing a counterpart hereof, a copy of which shall be provided to VIDAR within five days of signature.
5. Intellectual Property
(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights, interests or intellectual property rights by assignment, license or otherwise, relating to any Confidential Information in or for any intellectual property, invention, discovery or improvement or derivative made, conceived or acquired prior or subsequent to the Effective Date. Except for the limited right to use the Confidential Information as set forth above, all intellectual property, patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other rights and interests in the Confidential Information and the products, inventions, ideas, works, creation, symbols, data, reports, opinions and all other concepts and materials developed, invented, reduced to practice, authored or created by Receiver (including portions and derivatives thereof) in any medium arising from or relating to this Agreement (“Intellectual Property”) shall be the sole and exclusive property of VIDAR.
(b) All Intellectual Property that are original works of authorship shall be considered works made for hire (as that phrase is used in Section 101 of the United States Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 or analogous law). If any Intellectual Property is found not to be a work made for hire and/or is owned by Receiver or any third party, Receiver hereby irrevocably (and shall cause any third party owner to) assigns and transfers all rights to and interests in such Intellectual Property to VIDAR without further consideration.
(c) Receiver shall promptly disclose all Intellectual Property to VIDAR and shall make and maintain adequate and current written records of all Intellectual Property. Receiver agrees to take all actions, execute all instruments and fully cooperate with VIDAR, its successors, assigns or nominees in which, in the opinion of VIDAR, are expedient or necessary at any time to file, prosecute, register, evidence, secure, maintain or litigate all such VIDAR rights and interests in the Intellectual Property throughout the world, including all commercial, legal or administrative proceedings involving the same. All expenses of applying for and obtaining such rights and interests shall be borne by VIDAR. VIDAR shall reimburse Receiver for pre-approved expenses paid in connection with such cooperation.
6. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the request of VIDAR or the termination or expiration of this Confidential Agreement, Receiver shall promptly return to VIDAR all copies of the Confidential Information and obtained by Receiver.
7. Disclaimer. Receiver acknowledges that the Confidential Information may relate to processes or products that are developmental and may or may not have been reduced to practical application in prototype form. Accordingly, Receiver understands that neither VIDAR has made or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or value of the Confidential Information. RECEIVER AGREES THAT NEITHER VIDAR NOR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO RECEIVER OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES RESULTING FROM RECEIVER’S ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
8. Injunction. Receiver acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the Confidential Information is proprietary to and valuable information of VIDAR; (ii) VIDAR derives economic value from the Confidential Information not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; (iii) any disclosure or unauthorized use of the Confidential Information could cause irreparable harm and loss to VIDAR; and (iv) if this Agreement is breached, VIDAR can not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, VIDAR, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled by law or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent further breaches of this Agreement and to an order compelling specific performance of this Agreement. Receiver shall reimburse VIDAR for all costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by VIDAR in enforcing the obligations of Receiver.
9. General. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and all actions involving this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, to which the parties consent to jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their legal representatives, successors and assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, neither this Agreement, nor any rights granted hereunder may be assigned, transferred, conveyed or encumbered, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, by Receiver without the prior written consent of VIDAR (which may be granted or withheld in VIDAR’s sole and absolute judgment), and any attempt to do so will be deemed null and void. This Agreement becomes effective on the Effective Date and continues in effect thereafter for so long as any Confidential Information continues to exist. VIDAR may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited, unenforceable or not authorized in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition, unenforceability or non-authorization without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity, enforceability or legality of such provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter contained herein, supersedes all prior oral or written understandings and agreements relating thereto, except as expressly otherwise provided, and may not be altered, modified or waived in whole or in part, except in writing, signed by duly authorized representatives of the parties hereto. The failure of either party to insist upon the performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Agreement shall not be considered a waiver or relinquishment of future compliance therewith; nor shall a waiver by either party of any breach or any term, covenant, condition, agreement or provision, operate as a waiver of any other term, covenant condition, agreement or provision. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

5. No Disclosure. The RECEIVING PARTY and its employees, officers, agents and affiliates shall hold the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION in confidence and take all reasonable steps to preserve the confidential and proprietary nature of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, including, without limitation: (i) refraining from disclosing the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to persons within its organization not having a reason to know, and all persons outside its organization unless they have a reason to know and are bound by fiduciary duties of confidentiality to the RECEIVING PARTY; and (ii) advising all of its employees, officers, agents and affiliates who gain access to the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of its confidential and proprietary nature. The obligations of this paragraph also apply to the fact of the existence of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, of this Agreement, and the occurrence of all meetings and communications of the parties that involve CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. In the event the RECEIVING PARTY receives in writing an opinion from its outside counsel that it must disclose certain information, prohibited by the terms herein, in order to avoid committing a violation of law, the RECEIVING PARTY may disclose only that information necessary to avoid committing such violation of the law.
6. Discovery. In the event that the RECEIVING PARTY is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, the RECEIVING PARTY shall provide the DISCLOSING PARTY with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the DISCLOSING PARTY may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the DISCLOSING PARTY, the RECEIVING PARTY is nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the RECEIVING PARTY may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which such counsel advises RECEIVING PARTY is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the RECEIVING PARTY will cooperate with the DISCLOSING PARTY in seeking to preserve the confidentiality of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION before such tribunal.
7. No Use. The RECEIVING PARTY understand and agrees that it is not allowed to sell, license or otherwise exploit any parts, products, services documents or information that embody in whole or in part any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The furnishing of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION hereunder shall not be construed as the granting of a license under any patent, patent application, copyright, copyright registration, trade secret or other proprietary right by the DISCLOSING PARTY to any person or entity or as implying any obligation other than is specifically stated herein.
8. Limitation.

11. Injunctive Relief. The RECEIVING PARTY understands and agrees that monetary damages will not be sufficient to avoid or compensate for the unauthorized use or disclosure of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and that injunctive relief would be appropriate to prevent any actual or threatened use of disclosure of such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

13. Definitive Agreement. The parties hereto agree that no contract or agreement between the parties shall be deemed to exist unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and
delivered to both parties.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Agreement (“Agreement”) dated as of __________, is between ________________ (“Borrower”) and ____________________ (“Lending Agent”), acting in its capacity as agent for its various securities lending clients (each a “Principal”).
WHEREAS, Borrower and Lending Agent are parties to a securities lending agreement dated ________ (which, as the same may be amended from time to time, is herein referred to as “Borrowing Agreement”) pursuant to which Lending Agent loans securities to Borrower on behalf of Principals;
WHEREAS, the Borrower is required to obtain certain information (specified below) in order to meet certain regulatory requirements with respect to its credit and risk management processes regarding its continuing business relationship with Principals, and for certain financial reporting calculations; and
WHEREAS, in order for Lending Agent to provide such information, Lending Agent requires, and Borrower is willing to provide assurances that such information will be held in confidence by the credit, risk management and financial reporting areas of the firm, and to use the information only as set forth herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. In connection with any transaction entered or contemplated to be entered pursuant to the Borrowing Agreement, Lending Agent shall provide to the Borrower information regarding each Principal, including the Name, Tax or Government ID, address, and other specific identifying information, financial information, corporate structure and organization, and/or information concerning Loans entered into on behalf of specific Principals (collectively, the “Information”).
2. Borrower shall use the Information solely in its credit, risk management and net capital processes, including, without limitation, functions such as concentration limit monitoring, compliance or legal review, or senior management oversight as Borrower may reasonably deem necessary to comply with regulatory requirements including, without limitation, regulatory capital computation, regulatory reporting and concentration limit monitoring.
3. Borrower shall limit the distribution of the Information within the firm to only those credit, risk management, regulatory reporting and compliance areas who perform the functions described above. In particular, Borrower shall not permit the trading desks within the firm to have access to the Information, except and only to the extent that such trading desks are involved in the ordinary course of business in risk management functions. Borrower may also disclose the Information to its legal counsel.
4. Borrower shall maintain the Information in confidence and shall not disclose the information to any third party without the consent of Lending Agent; provided, however, that Borrower may disclose the Information to the extent required by subpoena, court order, request from a regulatory body with jurisdiction over Borrower, or as otherwise required by law or regulation. Borrower shall not be required to keep the Information confidential to the extent that the Information (a) becomes publicly known through means other than a breach of this Agreement by Borrower; (b) was in the possession of Borrower prior to receipt thereof from the Lending Agent; or (c) is independently learned, obtained or developed by Borrower without violating the terms of this Agreement.
5. If Borrower (or its employees or agents) breaches or threatens to breach this Agreement, Lending Agent may, in addition to any other remedies available, seek any equitable remedy it deems appropriate to enjoin an actual or threatened violation by Borrower.
6. Borrower acknowledges that, except with respect to information regarding loans entered into on behalf of specific Principals, Lending Agent did not create or compile the Information and is merely forwarding information obtained from Principals. Accordingly, Borrower acknowledges that Lending Agent makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or completeness of the Information and that Borrower is not relying on Lending Agent to have performed any review of the Information for accuracy or completeness.
7. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Borrower and Lending Agent hereby hereby irrevocably waive any and all rights to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.
8. This Agreement shall be effective as of the date set forth above. The obligations hereunder shall expire upon the earlier to occur of (a) ___ years from the termination date of the last loan of securities outstanding under the Borrowing Agreement or (b) the date upon which the Information ceases to be confidential as set forth above.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized representatives as of the day and year first above written.

B. The data and information that State expects to provide to Recipient for use in evaluating Recipient's proposal to provide the Services is confidential and not public data and the parties desire to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement to set forth their respective duties and obligations regarding State's data and information.
Provisions
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Background Information, which is incorporated by this reference as if fully re-written herein and the mutual covenants and provisions set forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1. Confidential Information. As used in this Agreement, ""Confidential Information"" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information about State, including, but not limited to data and information processed by State in connection with evaluating the Services. The term shall also include all ""protected health information"" (as defined by 45 C.F.R. § 160.103) and any other personally identifiable information (""PII"") regarding any individual who is, or may become, eligible for the State's Plan (including, but not limited to, such Plan's travel benefit). The Recipient hereby agrees to abide by State's determination that such information is Confidential Information and that the same is of a special and unique nature and value, important and material, that it gravely affects the effective and successful conduct of the business and that it may include personal identification information or other information of State or State employees and their dependents that is to be maintained as confidential.
Section 2. Preservation of Confidentiality. All Confidential Information (a) supplied by any employee, agent, consultant, or independent contractor of State (""State Representatives"") to the Recipient or any employee, agent, officer, director, shareholder, independent contractor or representative of the Recipient (collectively, the ""Recipient Representatives""), (b) obtained by the Recipient or any Recipient Representatives from any documents, meetings or telephone conversations with any State Representatives or from books or records of State, (c) obtained by the Recipient or any Recipient Representatives or in any other manner including through hosting the software evaluation on Recipient's website, or (d) jointly or individually developed by State and/or Recipient shall be protected and maintained by the Recipient on a confidential basis and the Recipient shall not use any of the Confidential Information for any purposes (other than as permitted by this Agreement). The Recipient shall refrain from directly or indirectly disclosing any of the Confidential Information to any person, firm, fund, or entity, or knowingly making any Confidential Information available to any others for any use (other than as permitted by this Agreement). Failure to mark any of the Confidential Information as confidential or proprietary shall not affect its status as Confidential Information. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the Recipient shall:
(a) Restrict disclosure of the Confidential Information only to those of the persons as may be absolutely necessary;
(b) Advise all persons to whom Confidential Information is disclosed of the strict obligations of confidentiality hereunder; and
(c) Take such steps to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as may be taken to protect the Recipient's own confidential materials, but in no event shall the Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care.
In addition to the foregoing, Recipient agrees to use reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical and technological safeguards to: (i) prevent use or disclosure of the Confidential Information other than as provided for by this Agreement; and (ii) implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Confidential Information.

(d) A description of what Recipient is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate the harm to individuals and to protect against further breaches; and
(e) Contact procedures for Individuals to ask questions or learn additional information, which shall include a toll free telephone number, an e-mail address, Web site or postal address.
In the event that some of the above listed information is not known by Recipient at the time of notification of State of the breach, Recipient shall provide such information to State as soon as it becomes available to Recipient, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after Recipient discovers such breach.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
(Technology Services Vendors)
This Non-Disclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”), dated as of ________________, 20 , is made by and between ______________________________________________________________________ (the “Contractor”) and The Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the U.S. House of Representatives (the “CAO”). The Contractor is a prospective offeror of (1) correspondence management system or constituent relationship management software services, (2) computer hardware maintenance services, and/or (3) systems administration support services (collectively, “Technology Services”) to one or more offices within the U.S. House of Representatives (the “House”). As the contracting officer of the House, the CAO agrees to make available to the Contractor certain non-public, confidential and proprietary information about the House.
“Confidential Information” means any information disclosed to the Contractor by the CAO or the House, including, but not limited to: (a) security practices, operational information, business plans, customer data, customer lists, customer names, designs, documents, drawings, engineering information, hardware configuration information, processes, products, product plans, research, services, specifications, software, source code and trade secrets; and (b) any other information designated (orally or in writing) as “confidential,” “proprietary” or of such nature that a reasonable person would understand such information to be confidential to the CAO or the House.
The Contractor agrees that hereafter it shall (i) treat all Confidential Information confidentially, and (ii) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating the possible procurement of Technology Services (and, if such procurement is made, for the purpose of performing such Technology Services). The Contractor further agrees to require each of its employees and agents to sign a form that would bind them in writing to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information. All documents containing Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall be promptly returned to the CAO upon the CAO’s request.
The Contractor understands that the CAO may seek any remedy available to it to ensure compliance with this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting the disclosure of Confidential Information and/or disqualification from the solicitation and contracting process. The Contractor agrees that if the terms and conditions of this Agreement are violated, the Contractor and its employees and agents may be subject to administrative, civil or criminal action.

"Attachment I. Non-Disclosure Agreement (Contractor)
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made by and between the State of Maryland (the “State”), acting by and through _______________________________________ (Issuing Agency Name) (the “Department” or “Agency” or “Authority” or “Commission”), and _____________________________________________ (the “Contractor”).
RECITALS
WHEREAS, the Contractor has been awarded a contract (the “Contract”) following the solicitation for ________________________________________________________ (Solicitation Title) Solicitation # ____________________; and
WHEREAS, in order for the Contractor to perform the work required under the Contract, it will be necessary for the State at times to provide the Contractor and the Contractor’s employees, agents, and subcontractors (collectively the “Contractor’s Personnel”) with access to certain information the State deems confidential information (the “Confidential Information”).
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of being given access to the Confidential Information in connection with the solicitation and the Contract, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the parties acknowledge, the parties do hereby agree as follows:
1. Regardless of the form, format, or media on or in which the Confidential Information is provided and regardless of whether any such Confidential Information is marked as such, “Confidential Information” means (1) any and all information provided by or made available by the State to the Contractor in connection with the Contract and (2) any and all personally identifiable information (PII) (including but not limited to personal information as defined in Md. Ann. Code, General Provisions §4-101(h) and Md. Ann. Code, State Govt. § 10-1301(c)) and protected health information (PHI) as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 that is provided by a person or entity to the Contractor in connection with this Contract. Confidential Information includes, by way of example only, information that the Contractor views, takes notes from, copies (if the State agrees in writing to permit copying), possesses or is otherwise provided access to and use of by the State in relation to the Contract.
2. The Contractor shall not, without the State’s prior written consent, copy, disclose, publish, release, transfer, disseminate, use, or allow access for any purpose or in any form, any Confidential Information except for the sole and exclusive purpose of performing under the Contract. The Contractor shall limit access to the Confidential Information to the Contractor’s Personnel who have a demonstrable need to know such Confidential Information in order to perform under the Contract and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. Contractor shall provide copies of such agreements to the State. The names of such personnel are attached hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment I-2. Contractor shall update Attachment I-2 by adding additional names (whether Contractor’s Personnel or a subcontractor’s personnel) as needed, from time to time.
3. If the Contractor intends to disseminate any portion of the Confidential Information to non-employee agents who are assisting in the Contractor’s performance of the Contract or will otherwise have a role in performing any aspect of the Contract, the Contractor shall first obtain the written consent of the State to any such dissemination. The State may grant, deny, or condition any such consent, as it may deem appropriate in its sole and absolute subjective discretion.
4. The Contractor hereby agrees to hold the Confidential Information in trust and in strictest confidence, adopt or establish operating procedures and physical security measures, and take all other measures necessary to protect the Confidential Information from inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties and to prevent all or any portion of the Confidential Information from falling into the public domain or into the possession of persons not bound to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.
5. The Contractor shall promptly advise the State in writing if it learns of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of the Confidential Information by any of the Contractor’s Personnel or the Contractor’s former Personnel. Contractor shall, at its own expense, cooperate with the State in seeking injunctive or other equitable relief against any such person(s).
6. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, return to the State all Confidential Information in its care, custody, control or possession upon request of the State or on termination of the Contract.
7. A breach of this Agreement by the Contractor or the Contractor’s Personnel shall constitute a breach of the Contract between the Contractor and the State.
8. Contractor acknowledges that any failure by the Contractor or the Contractor’s Personnel to abide by the terms and conditions of use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the State and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate the State for such breach. Accordingly, the Contractor agrees that the State may obtain an injunction to prevent the disclosure, copying or improper use of the Confidential Information. The Contractor consents to personal jurisdiction in the Maryland State Courts. The State’s rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and the State expressly reserves any and all rights, remedies, claims and actions that it may have now or in the future to protect the Confidential Information and seek damages from the Contractor and the Contractor’s Personnel for a failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. In the event the State suffers any losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, or costs (including, by way of example only, attorneys’ fees and disbursements) that are attributable, in whole or in part to any failure by the Contractor or any of the Contractor’s Personnel to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, the Contractor shall hold harmless and indemnify the State from and against any such losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, and costs.
9. The parties further agree that:
a. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland;
b. The rights and obligations of the Contractor under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the State;
c. The State makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information;
d. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;
e. Signatures exchanged by facsimile are effective for all purposes hereunder to the same extent as original signatures;
f. The Recitals are not merely prefatory but are an integral part hereof; and
g. The effective date of this Agreement shall be the same as the effective date of the Agreement entered into by the parties.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have, by their duly authorized representatives, executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

This agreement allows us to disclose confidential information to each other, to our own affiliates and to the other's affiliates, under the following terms.

""Control"" and ""own"" mean possessing a 50% or greater Interest in an entity or the right to direct the management of the entity.
2. Confidential information.

b. What is not included? The following types of information, however marked, are not confidential information. Information that:
 Is, or becomes, publicly available without a breach of this agreement;
 Was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential;
 Is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential;
 Is independently developed; or
 Is a comment or suggestion one of us volunteers about the other's business, products or services.
3. Treatment of confidential information.
a. In general. Subject to the other terms of this agreement, each of us agrees:
 We will not disclose the other's confidential information to third parties; and
 We will use and disclose the other's confidential information only for purposes of our business relationship with each other.
b. Security precautions. Each of us agrees:
 To take reasonable steps to protect the other's confidential information. These steps must be at least as protective as those we take to protect our own confidential information;
 To notify the other promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; and
 To cooperate with the other to help regain control of the confidential information and prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure of it.
c. Sharing confidential information with affiliates and representatives.
 A ""representative"" is an employee, contractor, advisor or consultant of one of us or one of our respective affiliates.
 Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information to our representatives (who may then disclose that confidential information to other of our representatives) only if those representatives have a need to know about it for purposes of our business relationship with each other. Before doing so, each of us must:
o Ensure that affiliates and representatives are required to protect the confidential information on terms consistent with this agreement; and
o Accept responsibility for each representative's use of confidential information.
 Neither of us is required to restrict work assignments of representatives who have had access to confidential information. Neither of us can control the incoming information the other will disclose to us in the course of working together, or what our representatives will remember, even without notes or other aids. We agree that use of information in representatives' unaided memories in the development or deployment of our respective products or services does not create liability under this agreement or trade secret law, and we agree to limit what we disclose to the other accordingly.
d. Disclosing confidential information if required to by law. Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, each of us must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give the other enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.
4. Length of confidential information obligations
a. Termination. This agreement continues in effect until one of us terminates it. Either of us may terminate this agreement for any reason by providing the other with 60 days' advance written notice. Termination of this agreement will not change any of the rights and duties made while this agreement is in effect.

c. time period does not apply if applicable law requires a longer period.
5. General rights, obligations and miscellaneous.

j. Entire agreement. This agreement does not grant any implied intellectual property licenses to confidential information, except as stated above. We may have contracts with each other covering other specific aspects of our relationship (""other contracts""). The other contract may include commitments about confidential information, either within it or by referencing another non-disclosure agreement. If so, those obligations remain in place for purposes of that other contract. With this exception, this is the entire agreement between us regarding confidential information. It replaces all other agreements and understandings regarding confidential information. We can only change this agreement with a signed document that states that it is changing this agreement.","mutual, nondisclosure, agreement, mutual, nondisclosure, agreement, agreement, party,

All such information collectively shall be referred to in this agreement as the “confidential information”.
3. CONFIDENTIALITY UNDERTAKING
3.1 The parties acknowledge that the confidential information is a valuable, special and unique asset belonging to the disclosing party and accordingly, that it is of the utmost importance to the disclosing party that the confidential information not be used to advance the interest of any persons other than the disclosing party. In view thereof, the parties undertake that -
3.2 they will not, without the prior written consent of the disclosing party:
3.2.1 during the course of the negotiations and discussions referred to in 1 or at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, use any of the confidential information, otherwise than for the purpose of such negotiations and discussions or for the implementation of any agreement resulting there from;
3.2.2 divulge, discuss with, disclose or reveal the confidential information of the disclosing party to any person, firm, corporation, association or any other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever (other than its employees and agents and only to the extent that such employees and agents require such information in the implementation of any agreement concluded between the parties);

Nothing in this agreement or its operation shall preclude, impair or restrict either party from continuing to engage in its business. It is recorded that the disclosing party may well have had business dealings with the receiving party’s customers and no right of exclusivity shall be afforded to the receiving party in this regard. For example, in larger corporate entities, it may well be that the receiving party and disclosing party are dealing with separate departments or individuals or may well have done so previously. The receiving party accepts this fact and whilst the disclosing party shall not intentionally interfere with the receiving party’s marketing strategy, this may at times be inevitable.
5. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Either party may request in writing at any time that any confidential information or any documents containing such confidential information, disclosed pursuant to the terms of this agreement and any copies thereof be returned with a written statement to the effect that upon such return the receiving party has not knowingly retained in its possession or under its control, either directly or indirectly, any such confidential information or any documents containing such confidential information or any copies thereof and the receiving party shall comply with any such request within seven days of receipt of such request.
6. TITLE
All confidential information of the disclosing party is acknowledged by the receiving party to be the property of the disclosing party and the disclosure of the confidential information shall not be deemed to confer any rights to that confidential information on the receiving party.
7. STANDARD OF CARE
The parties agree to protect the confidential information of the other party using not less than the same standard of care that would be applied to its own proprietary, secret or confidential information and that the confidential information shall be stored and disclosed in such a way as to prevent unauthorised disclosure.
8. EXCLUDED INFORMATION

8.1 is in the possession of the receiving party prior to receipt from the disclosing party;

8.3 is received from a third party without similar restrictions and without breach of this agreement.
9. BREACH

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, neither party shall be entitled to cancel this agreement in any circumstances whatsoever.
10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The parties acknowledge that the undertakings herein are fair and reasonable and are reasonably required to protect the other party’s confidential information.
11. GENERAL
11.1 Any failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege in relation to any confidential information and/or pursuant to this agreement will not constitute a waiver of that right, power or privilege, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise of that right, power or privilege.

11.3 Neither party shall be bound by any express or implied term, representation, warranty, promise or the like not recorded herein.

The Confidential Information is proprietary information and for the exclusive and non-transferable use of the persons to whom it is addressed and the recipients of the Confidential Information agree that all of the information contained herein is of a confidential nature and is subject to this Confidentiality Agreement, and that they will not, directly, or indirectly, disclose or permit their agents or affiliates to disclose any such information without the prior written consent of Transnet except as expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
2.3 Return of Confidential Information. Promptly following the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will deliver to the Disclosing Party all confidential information (and copies and extracts thereof) furnished to, or created by or on behalf of, the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the return of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
2.4 Remedies. The Receiving Party recognises and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a special, unique and extraordinary character to the Disclosing Party and the Target and the disclosure, misappropriation or unauthorised use of such Confidential Information by the Receiving Party cannot be fully compensated and that, further, any such disclosure, misappropriation or unauthorised use of the Confidential Information shall cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and/or the Target. The Receiving Party expressly agrees, therefore, that the Disclosing Party, in addition to any rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement or at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent the breach, or the further breach, of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees to reimburse the Disclosing Party for any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, opportunity costs, and direct or indirect expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees, profit opportunity returns foregone and any court costs) incurred by the Disclosing Party as a result of any prima facie breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.
3. GENERAL
3.1 Term and Termination. Notwithstanding whether or not the Proposed Transactions are concluded, the Receiving Party shall maintain the Confidential Information in confidence and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure.
3.2 Binding Successors. This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and assigns.
3.3 Waiver. The waiver or failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided for in this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any further right under this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law or otherwise unenforceable, it shall be enforced to the extent legally permissible and as necessary to reflect the intent of the Parties and shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
3.4 Variation. No amendment, alteration, addition or variation of the Agreement or any provision or term thereof, or any agreement or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement shall be binding unless recorded in a written document signed by the Parties.
3.5 Binding Agreement. This Agreement is binding upon each Party and the Receiving Party shall procure that it becomes binding on its respective agents, affiliates, partners, employees, advisors and consultants.
3.6 Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the Republic of South Africa and shall be governed by such laws without reference to any principles relating to resolving conflicts of law. The distribution of the Confidential Information in overseas jurisdictions may be restricted by law and therefore persons into whose possession that Confidential Information comes should inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions.
3.7 Copyrights and Proprietary Rights. The Receiving Party shall not remove any copyright or proprietary rights notice attached to or included in the Confidential Information.
3.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire agreement between Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.
3.9 Storage of Confidential Information. The Confidential Information must not be copied, reproduced, distributed, stored digitally or by other means, or passed to others at any time other than in accordance with this Confidentiality Agreement or with the prior written consent of Transnet.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA)
This Nondisclosure Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is entered into by and between _______________ with its principal offices at _______________, (""Disclosing Party"") and _______________, located at _______________ (""Receiving Party"") for the purpose of preventing the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information as defined below. The parties agree to enter into a confidential relationship concerning the disclosure of certain proprietary and confidential information (""Confidential Information"").
1. Definition of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, ""Confidential Information"" shall include all information or material that has or could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged. If Confidential Information is in written form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the word ""Confidential"" or some similar warning. If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly provide writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential Information.
2. Exclusions from Confidential Information. Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's representatives; or (d) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party's prior written approval.
3. Obligations of Receiving Party. Receiving Party shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to Confidential Information to employees, contractors and third parties as is reasonably required and shall require those persons to sign nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, without the prior written approval of Disclosing Party, use for Receiving Party's benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party any and all records, notes, and other written, printed, or tangible materials in its possession pertaining to Confidential Information immediately if Disclosing Party requests it in writing.
4. Time Periods. The nondisclosure provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Receiving Party's duty to hold Confidential Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Confidential Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret or until Disclosing Party sends Receiving Party written notice releasing Receiving Party from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.
5. Relationships. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either party a partner, joint venture or employee of the other party for any purpose.
6. Severability. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as best to affect the intent of the parties.
7. Integration. This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, representations, and understandings. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by both parties.
8. Waiver. The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement shall not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights.
9. Notice of Immunity. Employee is provided notice that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
This Agreement and each party's obligations shall be binding on the representatives, assigns and successors of such party. Each party has signed this Agreement through its authorized representative.

b. The Parties shall disclose the Information to their employees, Affiliates, external experts and/or consultants only on a need to know basis and only to the extent absolutely necessary for the Purpose. Each Party shall require that its external experts and/or consultants also have such policies and procedures in place to ensure their compliance with these confidentiality obligations.

The invalid provisions are to be replaced, backdated to the time of their becoming ineffective, by provisions which come closest to achieving their objective as agreed by the Parties.
4. Assignment
a. This Agreement may not be assigned by a Party hereto without the express written consent to such assignment by the other Parties.
5. Other
a. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the Parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of each of the Parties by their respective duly authorised officers or representatives.
b. This Agreement shall be valid when signed by duly authorised representatives of the Parties and shall be binding on each Party for 10 (ten) years as from the date of signature of the last signatory, even if at the end of the negotiations a data sharing agreement is not signed between the Parties, or until such time as the Information enters into the public domain.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
I, _______________________________________, an individual official, employee, consultant, or subcontractor of or to _____________________ (the Authorized Entity), intending to be legally bound, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional access to certain information, specified below, that is owned by, produced by, or in the possession of the United States Government.
(Signer will acknowledge the category or categories of information that he or she may have access to, and the signer’s willingness to comply with the standards for protection by placing his or her initials in front of the applicable category or categories.)
Initials:
Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII)
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with all requirements of the PCII program set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (CII Act) (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135, 6 USC 101 et seq.), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (6 CFR Part 29), as amended, and the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and with any such requirements that may be officially communicated to me by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee.
Initials:
Sensitive Security Information (SSI)
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of SSI information as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with 49 CFR Part 1520, “Protection of Sensitive Security Information,” “Policies and Procedures for Safeguarding and Control of SSI,” as amended, and any supplementary guidance issued by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security.
Initials:
Other Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU)
As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is an over-arching term that covers any information, not otherwise indicated above, which the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to or modification of could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Section 552a of Title 5, as amended, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This includes information categorized by DHS or other government agencies as: For Official Use Only (FOUO); Official Use Only (OUO); Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI); Limited Official Use (LOU); Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES); Safeguarding Information (SGI); Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI); and any other identifier used by other government agencies to categorize information as sensitive but unclassified.
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of the information to which I am granted access as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with the guidance provided to me relative to the specific category of information.
I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions of my access to the information indicated above:
1. I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination concerning the nature and protection of information to which I have been provided conditional access, including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures.
 2. By being granted conditional access to the information indicated above, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access.
3. I attest that I understand my responsibilities and that I am familiar with and will comply with the standards for protecting such information that I may have access to in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and/or directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access. I understand that the United States Government may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling and safeguarding information under this Agreement.
4. I will not disclose or release any information provided to me pursuant to this Agreement without proper authority or authorization. Should situations arise that warrant the disclosure or release of such information I will do so only under approved circumstances and in accordance with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I will honor and comply with any and all dissemination restrictions cited or verbally relayed to me by the proper authority.
5. (a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession.
(2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager’s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended.
(b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information.
6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original.
7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.
8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information.
9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
(b) With respect to PCII I hereby assign to the entity owning the PCII and the United States Government, all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of PCII not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.
11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter.
12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies.
14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.
15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.
16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement.
17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.

(b) to its lawyers; or
(c) if the disclosure is required by law, regulation or professional requirements; or
(d) in the case of PwC, to other PwC firms or relevant subcontractors.
2.5 The receiving party will ensure that anyone who receives confidential information under clause 2.4 (b) is bound by confidentiality obligations before the confidential information is disclosed.
2.6 Nothing in this agreement will restrict your ability to disclose PwC’s advice concerning the tax (including social security) treatment or tax structure of any transaction regardless of any confidentiality markings on any communications.
3 Term

However, PwC may retain a copy of the confidential information for our internal purposes.
4 General

(a) Recipient shall receive all Information in strict confidence, shall exercise reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality and secrecy of the Information, and, except to the extent expressly permitted by this Non-Disclosure Agreement, shall not divulge Information to any third party without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party. The foregoing notwithstanding, Recipient may disclose Information to its Representatives to the extent each such Representative has a need to know such Information for the Purpose contemplated by this Non-Disclosure Agreement and agrees to observe and comply with the obligations of Recipient under this Non-Disclosure Agreement with regard to such Information. Recipient shall immediately notify Disclosing Party regarding, and shall be responsible hereunder for, any breach of the terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement to the extent caused by its Representatives.
(b) The Parties acknowledge that Information and/or data disclosed under this Non-Disclosure Agreement may include Personal Information (as such term is defined in the ISA Exhibit attached hereto).

(i) at the time of disclosure by or on behalf of Disclosing Party hereunder, is in the public domain, or thereafter enters the public domain without any breach of this Non-Disclosure Agreement by Recipient or any of its Representatives,
(ii) is rightfully in the possession or knowledge of Recipient or its Representatives prior to its disclosure by or on behalf of Disclosing Party hereunder,
(iii) is rightfully acquired by Recipient or its Representative(s) from a third party who is not under any obligation of confidence with respect to such Information, or
(iv) is developed by Recipient or its Representatives independently of the Information disclosed hereunder by or on behalf of Disclosing Party (as evidenced by written documentation).
(b) Recipient is hereby notified that, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §1833(b), individuals do not have criminal or civil liability under U.S. trade secret law for the following disclosures of a trade secret:

(ii) disclosure in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding if such filing is made under seal; and/or
(iii) under those circumstances where Recipient files a lawsuit for retaliation against Disclosing Party for reporting a suspected violation of law, Recipient may disclose Disclosing Party’s trade secret information to its attorney and may use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Recipient files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
(c) Nothing herein or in any other agreement between the Parties is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create any liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section.
§4. Production of Information. Recipient agrees that if it or any of its Representatives are required by law, by a court or by other governmental or regulatory authorities (including, without limitation, by oral question, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative demand or other process) to disclose any of Disclosing Party’s Information, Recipient shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice of any such request or requirement, to the extent permitted to do so by applicable law, so that Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Non-Disclosure Agreement. If, failing the entry of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Recipient (or any Representative of Recipient) is, in the opinion of its counsel, legally compelled to disclose such Information, Recipient may disclose, and may permit such Representative to disclose, such portion of the Information that its counsel advises must be disclosed and such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of any term of this Non-Disclosure Agreement. In any event, Recipient shall use (and, to the extent applicable, shall cause its Representatives to use) reasonable efforts to seek confidential treatment for Information so disclosed if requested to do so by Disclosing Party, and shall not oppose any action by, and shall reasonably cooperate with, Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Information.
§5. Scope of Use. Recipient and each of its Representatives shall use Information disclosed by or on behalf of Disclosing Party solely in connection with the Purpose and shall not use, directly or indirectly, any Information for any other purpose without Disclosing Party’s prior written consent.
§6. No Representations; No Rights Conferred. Disclosing Party makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, with respect to any Information disclosed hereunder, including, without limitation, any representations or warranties as to the quality, accuracy, completeness or reliability of any such Information; all such representations and warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. Neither Disclosing Party nor its Representatives shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to the use of, or reliance upon, the Information by Recipient or its Representatives. Neither Recipient nor its Representatives shall acquire any rights in Information by virtue of its disclosure hereunder.

§7. Return or Destruction of Information. Recipient shall return and deliver, or cause to be returned and delivered, to Disclosing Party, or destroy or cause to be destroyed (with certification of destruction delivered to Disclosing Party), all tangible Information, including copies and abstracts thereof, within thirty (30) days of a written request by Disclosing Party (a “Request”). The foregoing notwithstanding, Recipient may retain one (1) copy of such Information for archival purposes only and subject to compliance with the terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that Recipient shall not be required to return to Disclosing Party, or destroy, copies of Disclosing Party’s Information that (A) reside on Recipient’s or its Representatives’ backup, disaster recovery or business continuity systems, or (B) that Recipient or its Representatives are obligated by applicable law and/or governmental regulations to retain. Recipient agrees that, following its receipt of the Request, it shall neither retrieve nor use Disclosing Party’s Information for any purpose other than that specified in clause (B) above.
- 5 -
§8. No Partnership, Etc. Nothing contained herein shall bind, require, or otherwise commit a Party (or any Affiliate thereof) to proceed with any project, sale, acquisition, or other transaction of or with the other Party or any other entity. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or other joint relationship is created by this Non-Disclosure Agreement. Neither this Non-Disclosure Agreement nor any discussions or disclosures hereunder shall prevent either Party from conducting similar discussions with other parties or performing work, so long as such discussions or work do not result in the disclosure or use of Information in violation of the terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement. The terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party’s right to independently engage in any transaction, or independently develop any information, without use of the other Party’s Information.
§9. Term and Termination. Except with respect to any Information that is Customer Information, CEII or Personal Information, Recipient’s obligations and duties under this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall have a term of [ ] [()] years from the Effective Date (the “Term”), but in no event will the confidentiality obligations herein terminate less than one (1) year from the date of the last disclosure. In the case of any Information that is Customer Information, CEII or Personal Information, Recipient’s obligations and duties under this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall survive for (i) the Term, or (ii) so long as such Customer Information, CEII or Personal Information, as applicable, is required to be kept confidential under applicable law, whichever period is longer (the “Special Information Term”). Either Party may terminate this Non-Disclosure Agreement by written notice to the other Party. Notwithstanding any such termination, all rights and obligations hereunder shall survive (i) for the Special Information Term for all Customer Information, CEII or Personal Information disclosed prior to such termination, and (ii) for the Term for all other Information disclosed prior to such termination.
§10. Injunctive Relief. The Parties acknowledge that a breach of this Non-Disclosure Agreement by Recipient may cause irreparable harm to Disclosing Party for which money damages would be inadequate and would entitle Disclosing Party to injunctive relief and to such other remedies as may be provided by law.
§11. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the [Commonwealth of Massachusetts][State of New York][State of Rhode Island] without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws contained therein. Each Party hereby submits to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the courts of the [Commonwealth of Massachusetts][State of New York][State of Rhode Island] for the purpose of interpretation and enforcement of this Non-Disclosure Agreement.
§12. Amendments. This Non-Disclosure Agreement may be amended or modified only by an instrument in writing signed by authorized representatives of all Parties.
§13. Assignment. This Non-Disclosure Agreement may not be assigned without the express written consent of all Parties hereto; provided, however, that any Party may assign this Non-Disclosure Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party without the consent of any other Party.
§14. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof shall be prohibited by, or determined to be invalid under, applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Non-Disclosure Agreement. All obligations and rights of the Parties expressed herein shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, those provided by applicable law.
§15. Entire Agreement. This Non-Disclosure Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and any and all previous representations or agreements with respect to such subject matter, either oral or written, are hereby annulled and superseded.
§16. Consents and Waivers. Any consent or waiver of compliance with any provision of this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party purported to be bound thereby, and then such consent or waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial waiver thereof preclude any other exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.
§17. No Publicity. [No Party shall issue any press release or make any other public announcement regarding the existence of this Non-Disclosure Agreement or any discussions among the Parties regarding the Purpose without the prior written consent of all Parties.]

The following terms and conditions shall apply with regard to Personal Information as defined in this Information Security Addendum (“Addendum”). In the case of any inconsistency, conflict, or any other difference with respect to Personal Information between the Non-Disclosure Agreement and any of the terms in this Addendum, the terms of this Addendum shall in all cases be controlling. To the extent any capitalized terms are not defined in this Addendum, such shall have the same definition as have been provided in the preceding Non-Disclosure Agreement. The obligations of Contractor under this Addendum shall be deemed to apply to and bind Contractor’s Representative to the extent such Representative or Affiliate receives or has access to any Personal Information; provided, however, that Contractor shall remain solely liable for any noncompliance with the terms of this Addendum caused by its Representatives.
1.0 DEFINITIONS
1.1 “Personal Information” – means information defined as “personal information or “personal data” under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Personal Information includes information that identifies or could be used to re-identify a specific person, including but not limited to first name and last name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements: addresses; residential and/or mobile telephone numbers; e-mail addresses; social security numbers; medical insurance numbers; state issued identification card number (including tribal identification numbers); driver’s license numbers or other driver identification data; personnel records; financial account information; credit related information, including any information relating to credit checks or background checks; credit or debit card numbers and personal identification numbers such as access codes, security codes or passwords that would permit access to an individual’s financial account; and medical or health information. Without limiting the foregoing, Personal Information includes all private data of National Grid and its affiliates’ employees, officers, directors, subcontractors, agents, and customers, that Contractor receives from National Grid, and as may be defined by applicable state and/or federal statutes and regulations. Personal Information shall not include publicly available information, lawfully made available to the general public in federal, state, or local government records.
1.2 “Law” – means, with respect to this Addendum, any foreign, federal, state or local law or regulation, promulgated or amended from time to time during the term of this Non-Disclosure Agreement, applicable to Personal Information received by Contractor from National Grid, including, but not limited to, the Protection of Personal Information of Residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 201 CMR 17.00 (the “MA Security Regs”), the Rhode Island Identity Theft Protection Act, RIGL § 11-49.3-1 (the “RI Security Regs”) and the California data security regulations, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.81.5, (the “CA Security Regs”).
2.0 SECURITY
2.1 Contractor hereby agrees to comply with all Laws it receives from National Grid during the term of the Non-Disclosure Agreement and ensure that all subcontractors or vendors who have access to National Grid’s Personal Information comply with all Laws.
2.2 Contractor agrees to, and agrees to ensure that its subcontractors and/or vendors who have access to National Grid’s Personal Information will, implement and maintain appropriate physical, technical and administrative security measures for the protection of Personal Information as required by any Law or as required by National Grid; including, but not limited to: (i) encrypting all transmitted records and files containing Personal Information that will travel across public networks, and encryption of all data containing Personal Information to be transmitted wirelessly; (ii) prohibiting the transfer of Personal Information to any portable device unless such transfer has been approved in advance; (iii) retaining Personal Information for a period no longer than is reasonably required to provide the services requested, to meet the purpose for which it was collected, or in accordance with a written retention policy or as may be required by Law; and (iv) encrypting any Personal Information to be transferred to a portable device.
2.3 Contractor shall develop, document and implement quality assurance measures and internal controls, including implementing tools and methodologies, so that the Services outlined in the any agreements between the Parties are performed in an accurate and timely manner, in accordance with such agreement and applicable Law.
2.4 Contractor shall: (i) maintain a strong control environment in day-to-day operations; (ii) document the processes and procedures for quality assurance and internal controls; (iii) develop and execute a process to ensure regular internal control self-assessments are performed with respect to the Services; and (iv) maintain an internal audit function sufficient to monitor the processes and systems used to provide the Services.
2.5 Contractor shall not, directly or indirectly, divulge, disclose or communicate any Personal Information it receives from National Grid to any Person, firm, or corporation, except with the written permission of National Grid.
2.6 All records pertaining to Personal Information received from National Grid, whether developed by National Grid or others, are and shall remain the property of National Grid.
2.7 In addition to the above requirements, Contractor shall adopt, implement and maintain security procedures sufficient to protect Personal Information from improper access, disclosure, use, or premature destruction. Such security procedures shall be reasonably acceptable to National Grid and in compliance with all applicable Laws as they are promulgated or amended. Contractor shall maintain or adopt a written information security program (“WISP”) or its equivalent consistent with the MA Security Regs and the RI Security Regs, and any other applicable Laws that govern the protection of Personal Information received from National Grid or maintained on behalf of National Grid. Contractor agrees to apply the standards and requirements of the MA Security Regs and RI Security Regs to all such Personal Information, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the subject of Personal Information resides. During the term of the Non-Disclosure Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years thereafter, Contractor shall maintain, and provide for National Grid’s review, at National Grid’s request, (a) Contractor’s WISP; and (b) other applicable security program documents, including summaries of its incident response policies, encryption standards and/or other computer security protection policies or procedures, that constitute compliance with applicable Laws. Contractor shall provide National Grid with notice of any amendments to its WISP and such policies or programs, and any new policies or programs related to information privacy and security as may be adopted by Contractor from time to time, within thirty (30) days after the adoption of any such amendment, policy or program or changes in applicable Law.
2.8 Contractor agrees to notify National Grid promptly, but in no event later than 24 hours, after discovery of a security vulnerability, including, but not limited to, an exploitation of security vulnerabilities by third parties that have resulted in corruption, unauthorized modification, sale, rental, and/or otherwise damages to or materially alters the integrity of National Grid’s Information, and shall work with National Grid to mitigate such vulnerabilities.
2.9 Contractor shall have a process for managing both minor and major security incidents. Contractor shall notify National Grid promptly, and in no event later than five (5) days after discovery, in writing, of any unauthorized access, possession, use, destruction or disclosure of Personal Information (a “Security Breach”). Contractor shall promptly and in writing provide National Grid with full details of the Security Breach, and shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate such Security Breach and prevent a recurrence thereof. Security Breaches include, but are not limited to, a virus or worm outbreak, cyber security intrusions into systems directly responsible for supporting National Grid data and services, physical security breaches into facilities directly responsible for supporting National Grid data and services, and other directed attacks on systems directly responsible for supporting National Grid data and services. Contractor shall not be required to provide a written report of attempted security incidents. “Attempted Security Incidents” means, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewall, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, common denial of service attacks, and any combination of the above, so long as no such incident results in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Information or other serious vulnerability to National Grid’s data. In the event of a Security Breach, the parties shall cooperate to (a) mitigate and resolve any data privacy or security issues involving Personal Information, and (b) make any notifications to individuals affected by the Security Breach, and/or governmental/administrative entities as required by Law. Contractor’s failure to comply with this Article 2.9 shall be considered a material breach of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, for which no cure period shall apply.
2.10 Following a Security Breach, National Grid, or its designated agent, shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to Contractor, to complete a review of Contractor’s security measures and ensure that unauthorized access to Personal Information has been eliminated.
2.11 Contractor agrees to ensure that any subcontractor or vendor to which it provides National Grid’s Information, including Personal Information received from National Grid, or to which it provides National Grid’s Information and/or Personal Information created or received by Contractor on behalf of National Grid, agrees to the same restrictions and conditions set forth herein through a written contractual agreement.
2.12 Contractor agrees that National Grid’s data, including Personal Information, may not be maintained, stored, or transmitted outside of the United States of America, except for entities that are legally affiliated with Contractor or are wholly owned subsidiaries of Contractor.
2.13 Contractor agrees that it shall be responsible for any and all acts of any subcontractors or vendors to which it allows access to National Grid Information and/or Personal Information.
2.14 Contractor shall provide National Grid with a list of all subcontractors and vendors that will have access to National Grid’s Confidential and/or Personal Information.
2.15 Contractor understands the extremely sensitive nature of the Information, including Personal Information it receives from National Grid, and acknowledges that National Grid would suffer irreparable harm, for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, if National Grid’s Personal Information were improperly disclosed. Contractor therefore agrees that National Grid shall be entitled to seek and obtain equit","nondisclosure, agreement, nondisclosure, agreement, “, nondisclosure, agreement, ”, dated, 20, “, effective,

1.5 This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and interpreted in accordance with the law of the Republic of South Africa.
1.6 This Agreement constitutes a stipulatio alteri (namely, a benefit in favor of a third party which may be accepted by such third party) in favor of the Business/es and the Seller/s, the benefits of which may be accepted by them at any time.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 The Buyer records that it is (and/or has been and/or will be) partaking in investigations of (and/or negotiations with) various Seller/s and/or Business/es, with a view towards potentially acquiring such Business/es. The Buyer further acknowledges that it is serious in its investigations towards potentially acquiring a Business.
2.2 The Buyer realises that, in the course of its investigations (and/or negotiations), Aldes, the Business/es and/or the Seller/s will be required to disclose Confidential Information and/or Confidential Material to the Buyer, albeit for the purposes of assisting the Buyer in determining whether or not it wishes to acquire any Business/es or otherwise.
2.3 The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the sole reason for, and the sole purpose of, any disclosures of Confidential Information and/or Confidential Material by Aldes, the Business/es and/or the Seller/s is strictly limited to that stated in clauses 2.1 and 2.2 above (the “Purpose”).

For avoidance of doubt, the Buyer will at all times act in good faith and will only transact and deal with Seller/s and/or Business/es, via the brokerage, intervention and mediation of Aldes.
6.3 The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Aldes is, will be and will remain entitled to receipt of its agreed brokerage commission (albeit due and payable by the Seller/s, the Business/es, the Buyer or any of them), should the Buyer (albeit directly itself or indirectly through any of its subsidiaries, holding companies, group companies, related parties and/or inter-related parties or otherwise indirectly) or anyone else the Buyer may have introduced to the Business/es and/or Seller/s, conclude any agreements and/or transactions contemplated in clauses 2.1 and/or 2.2 above with (or with regard to) any Business/es and/or Seller/s.
7. GENERAL

7.2 Any indulgence, latitude or extension of time which may be allowed by either of Aldes, the Seller/s and/or the Business/es shall not under any circumstances be taken as preventing any of them from exercising their rights contained in this Agreement.
8. BUYER’S INFORMATION
8.1 The Buyer notes that Aldes’ decision to introduce any Business/es for sale to the Buyer (and the Seller/s and/or Business/es decision to enter into discussions with the Buyer) is, in part, based on the information presented by the Buyer under and in terms of the Buyer’s Profile on the face of this Agreement.

9. FURTHER CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS

WHEREAS, Casino and Receiving Party have entered into discussions to _______________________________________________ (herein after referred to as the “Project”) and, in the course of these discussions, Receiving Party will have access to Confidential Information (as defined below) about the Casino; and WHEREAS, the parties wish to protect such Confidential Information.
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
1. “Confidential Information” means any and all confidential and/or proprietary information disclosed by the Casino to the Receiving Party, which may include without limitation: financial information, business information, marketing data, trade secrets, and other data, materials, products, plans, specifications, reports, manuals, computer software or programs, contractual relationships and other similar information delivered in any form or media.
2. Confidential Information is disclosed to Receiving Party solely for the purpose of providing services for the Project. Receiving Party agrees to hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence. Receiving Party agrees not to use, divulge, reproduce or otherwise make available the Confidential Information other than for the purposes of the Project and to disclose it only to its officers, agents, employees, partners, and professional advisors as necessary, who shall also be bound to comply with this Agreement.
3. Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no case, less than reasonable care.
4. Receiving Party will immediately notify the Casino upon the discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information.
5. Receiving Party shall have no obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information if it can demonstrate that the information: (a) is publicly available at the time of disclosure; (b) becomes publicly available after disclosure through no act of the receiving party or its representatives; (c) is in the receiving party’s possession free of obligation; (d) is developed by the receiving party without use of the Confidential Information or through other breach of this Agreement; (e) is disclosed to the receiving party by a third party without obligation; (e) is not identifiable as confidential; or (f) is required to be publicly disclosed pursuant to a properly executed subpoena or other regulatory or court order (“Order”), provided the receiving party (i) gives reasonable written notice to the disclosing party, (ii) gives the disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to respond to the Order, and (iii) limits disclosure to that portion of the Confidential Information required by the Order.
6. Upon the request of Casino, Receiving Party shall immediately return all Confidential Information received in written or tangible form, including all notes, copies, or media containing such Confidential Information. Alternatively, Casino may direct Receiving Party to destroy such Confidential Information, in which case Receiving Party shall confirm such destruction in writing within twenty (20) days thereafter.
7. Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any other person or entity other than as provided herein, without Casino’s prior written consent. Neither party nor any of its representatives shall contact, either directly or indirectly, any governmental official, lender or other third party (other than a representative as provided herein) to discuss the Project or the business or the assets of the other party, or a potential business transaction with or concerning the other party, without first obtaining the written consent of the other party.
8. Waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in writing. A waiver or breach of one provision of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver or acceptance of a breach of another provision of this Agreement.
9. Neither party shall assign this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party.
10. This Agreement shall have a term of three (3) years. Receiving Party’s obligations in relation to technical and personally-identifiable information shall be indefinite.

The individual or company specified above (""Receiving Party""), Dominion Energy South Carolina, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of South Carolina and located at 220 Operation Way, Cayce, SC 29033, on behalf of itself, its corporate parent Dominion Energy and its corporate affiliate Dominion Energy South Carolina, Inc. Transmission (collectively, ""DESC""), and South Carolina Public Service Authority (""Santee Cooper""), a state-owned electric and water utility organized and existing under the laws of the state of South Carolina and located at 1 Riverwood Dr., Monks Corner, SC 29461 (each of DESC and Santee Cooper, a ""Disclosing Party"" and DESC and Santee Cooper collectively, the ""Disclosing Parties""), enter into this Non-Disclosure Agreement (""Agreement"") as of _________________________ (""Effective Date"").
Background. The Disclosing Parties may, in their discretion, provide the Receiving Party information related to their confidential and critical energy infrastructure information.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, and with the intent to be legally bound hereby, the Receiving Party agrees as follows:
1. Confidential Information. The term ""Confidential Information"" means all written, electronic, printed or other materials disclosed by the Disclosing Parties, and all information ascertained through discussions with the Disclosing Parties, concerning the planning process. Confidential Information shall include, but is not limited to, all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, models, ""base cases"", plans, procedures, calculations, reports or other documents prepared by the Disclosing Parties that may contain or reflect such information.
2. Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. The term ""Critical Energy Infrastructure Information"" or ""CEII"" as used in this Agreement refers to the official definition provided in 18 C.F.R. § 388.113(c)(1). CEII shall be protected under the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, CEII shall also include any information which may be described as non-public transmission information including, but not limited to, the following: maps, charts, and diagrams, including location, longitude and latitude for either or both of the Disclosing Parties' electric systems; and system studies including flow studies, models, ""base cases"" and system planning for either or both of the Disclosing Parties. All CEII is also Confidential Information. Given the sensitive nature of CEII, the Receiving Party has a higher duty of care to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
3. Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information.
The Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of its internal evaluation. The Receiving Party shall not make any other use, in whole or in part, of any such Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party.
The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, it shall exercise the same care used to protect its own confidential proprietary information, but no less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. If the Receiving Party is an individual, the Receiving Party may not disclose any Confidential information to any person or entity without the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. If the Receiving Party is a company, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information (i) to the Receiving Party's directors, officers and employees (collectively, ""Representatives""), in each case only to the extent reasonably necessary for the Receiving Party's internal use and only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information and that he or she must comply with such restrictions, and (ii) to any other person or entity only with the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative.
The Receiving Party shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose Confidential Information or any reports, work product or other documents containing any Confidential Information to any third party, firm, corporation or entity.
Except as may be required by applicable law, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall not: (a) confirm or deny any statement made by a third party regarding Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII; (b) disclose to any person the fact that Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII have been made available to it; (c) confirm that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place; or (d) disclose any of the terms or conditions with respect to same. If any such actions are required by applicable law, the Receiving Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 5 below.
4. Additional Provisions Relating to Disclosure and Use of CEII.
The Receiving Party shall not use CEII, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than that for which the CEII was specifically provided, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make copies of CEII, but such copies become CEII and subject to these same terms and conditions. The Receiving Party shall not knowingly use CEII for an illegal or non-legitimate purpose. The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its obligations under this Agreement, it shall employ an enhanced standard of care in order to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the CEII. The Receiving Party shall maintain CEII in a secure manner and place and shall be responsible for ensuring that its Representatives who receive CEII do the same.
The Receiving Party shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose CEII or any reports, work product or other documents containing any CEII to any third party, firm, corporation or entity. The Receiving Party may disclose CEII (i) only to its Representatives who have properly executed individual non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in the course of their employment specifically pertaining to confidential information and CEII they receive in the course of their employment and (ii) only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the CEII and that he or she must comply with such restrictions.. Further, such disclosure must be limited to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to evaluate the subject matter of the requested materials. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any CEII to any of its Representatives who have been convicted of any felony.
Except as allowed under Section 5, Required Disclosure, the Receiving Party shall not submit CEII obtained from the Disclosing Parties to any government agency for any reason without first obtaining written permission from the respective Disclosing Party, and then fully complying with the requirements of 18 C.F.R. §§ 388.112, 113 for requesting special treatment of the CEII.
5. Required Disclosure. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required by depositions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand or similar process (i) to disclose any CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) to disclose any discussions pertaining thereto, or (iii) to take any other action described in the last paragraph of Section 3 above, the Receiving Party shall provide to the relevant Disclosing Parties prompt written notice of such request(s) and shall use reasonable efforts to resist disclosure until an appropriate protective order may be sought. If, in the absence of a protective order, Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the written opinion of its counsel, legally required to disclose CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, then, in such event Receiving Party may disclose such information after the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party written notice of the proposed disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure.
6. Return of Documents and Destruction of Electronically Stored Information. Disclosing Parties may elect at any time to terminate further use of or access to the CEII. In such case, the Receiving Party shall return any and all CEII upon the Disclosing Party's written re(cid:84)uest, including all hardcopy originals, copies, translations, notes, reports, schematics, flowcharts, e-mails, tape recordings, or any other form of said material, without retaining any copy or duplicate supplement thereof and shall promptly destroy any and all written, printed or other material or information derived from the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall provide attested certification from an authorized representative confirming such return and destruction ""provided however, Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such documentation in its secure legal files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this agreement, as well as copies of electronically exchanged Confidential Information that are made as a matter of routine information technology back-up, which copies shall continue to be kept confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.""
7. Survival of Obligations. Regardless of any termination of any business relationship between the Parties, the obligations and commitments established by this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
8. Nature of Information; Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party hereby accepts the representations of Disclosing Parties that the CEII disclosed pursuant to this Agreement is of a special, unique, extraordinary, and intellectual character and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its representatives and that specific performance and injunctive or other equitable remedies for any such breach shall be available to it. If there is a breach, then Disclosing Parties shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies which they may have at law or in equity, to seek to have a decree of specific performance or an injunction issued by any competent court, requiring the breach to be cured or enjoining all persons involved from continuing the breach. The Receiving Party also acknowledges that the interests of Disclosing Parties in such CEII may be irreparably injured by disclosure. The remedy stated above may be pursued in addition to any other remedies applicable at law or equity for breach of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action which either party may have against the other shall not constitute a defense or bar to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
9. Governing Law. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the legal relations of the Receiving Party and Disclosing Parties to it shall be governed by the laws of the State of South Carolina, excluding its conflict of laws principles. Any action arising out of the performance of this Agreement must be filed and resolved exclusively in a state or federal court or tribunal sitting in the State of South Carolina. The parties consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of those courts and tribunals.
10. No Other Agreement. The Receiving Party expressly understands that this Agreement is not and shall not be construed as any form of a letter of intent or agreement to enter into any type of transaction. This agreement is to evidence the Receiving Party's agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information/CEII disclosed to it by Disclosing Parties, and shall not constitute any commitment or obligation on the part of either Party to enter into any specific contractual arrangement of any nature whatsoever.
11. No Representation or Warranties. With respect to any information, including but not limited to CEII, which either Disclosing Party furnishes or otherwise disclose to Receiving Party, the Receiving Party understands and agrees that that Disclosing Party does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, completeness or fitness for a particular purpose thereof. Neither this Agreement, nor the disclosure of CEII hereunder, shall be construed in any way as granting any license or rights to any information or data now or hereafter owned or controlled by Disclosing Parties to Receiving Party and all such Confidential Information/CEII shall remain the property of Disclosing Parties.
12. Right to Execute. The undersigned representative signing below affirms and warrants that he/she has all right and duly delegated authority to bind the entity to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
13. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations under it shall be assigned or delegated, and any purported assignment shall be void.
14. No Waiver. No failure or delay by either Disclosing Parties or Receiving Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
15. Survival. This Agreement shall survive indefinitely and shall not be affected by the performance, termination or expiration of any other obligations or agreements between the Disclosing Parties and Receiving Party.
16. Notices. Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered by FedEx or another nationally recognized overnight delivery service or by U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested, to the respective addresses of the parties listed above, or such other addresses of which a party gives the other party written notice in accordance with this Section 16.
17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Disclosing Parties and Receiving Party concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof, and no modifications of this Agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof will be binding, unless approved in writing by the Disclosing Parties and the Receiving Party. E-mail is expressly excluded as a form of amendment.

Agreement means this Non-Disclosure Agreement for Project Proposals.
Confidential Information means all information relating to the Project or the Contractor’s proposal for the Project and all information relating to the nature of either Party’s business, affairs or trade secrets, which either Party directly or indirectly receives or acquires from the other Party, or the other Party’s representative, either in writing or verbally (but in the case of verbal information, only that which is reduced to writing by the Disclosing Party and delivered to the Receiving Party within 10 days of the verbal disclosure), or through observation of the Project, except information falling into any one or more of the following categories:
(a) information which the Receiving Party can show was in its possession on a non-confidential basis before receipt of the information from the Disclosing Party;
(b) information which is lawfully in the public domain at the time of the Receiving Party’s receipt of the information from the Disclosing Party, but not including the Company’s request for proposals for the Project;
(c) information which, after the Receiving Party’s receipt of the information from the Disclosing Party, becomes part of the public domain through no act of the Receiving Party or of any third party under an obligation of confidence with respect to such information, but only after such information becomes part of the public domain; or
(d) information which, after receipt of the information by the Receiving Party, is lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party, but only after such information is so received, and provided such third party is under no obligation of confidence with respect to such information.
Disclosing Party means the Party disclosing Confidential Information.
Effective Date means the date on which this Agreement is deemed to be effective, as first written above.
Initial Term means the 1 year period commencing on the Effective Date and expiring at 11:59 pm. on _____________, 20__.
Party means either the Company or Contractor and Parties means both of them.
Permitted Purpose means the purpose for which the Confidential Information is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party and which is more particularly described as:
(i) responding to the Company’s request for proposals for the Project, in the case of the Contractor;
(ii) assessing the Contractor’s proposal, in the case of the Company; and
(iii) if applicable, negotiation by the Parties of a definitive agreement related to the Project.
Permitted Recipients means those persons who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose and who are officers, directors, employees, agents or contractors (at any level) of the Receiving Party or its affiliates, or anyone else for whom the Receiving Party takes responsibility for under this Agreement.

Receiving Party means the Party receiving Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party.
2. PERMITTED PURPOSE
2.1 The Company and the Contractor believe it is in their mutual best interest to disclose information to support the Permitted Purpose. Either Party may disclose Confidential Information to the other for the Permitted Purpose, which disclosure will be governed by the Agreement.
3. PROTECTION
3.1 Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and shall use reasonable care, which is at least the same degree of care that the Receiving Party ordinarily uses with respect to its own proprietary information, in relation to the use, transmittal and storage of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
3.2 The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose and, subject to section 3.3, shall limit the disclosure of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to Permitted Recipients.
3.3 The Receiving Party shall not make any copies, reproductions or abstracts of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except as specifically may be required for the Permitted Purpose. All copies, reproductions and abstracts of the Confidential Information shall also be deemed to be Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the same extent as any originals.
3.4 Before disclosing any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the Permitted Recipients, the Receiving Party shall identify to the Permitted Recipients that it is the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and is subject to disclosure and usage restrictions, and shall ensure that the Permitted Recipients have:
(a) executed Appendix A – Permitted Recipient’s Acknowledgement; or
(b) are bound in writing by confidentiality terms, policies or procedures no less restrictive than those in this Agreement.
3.5 The Receiving Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by the Permitted Recipients.
3.6 Confidential Information shall be used and stored in secure locations that are not accessible to the personnel who are not Permitted Recipients.
3.7 The Receiving Party shall immediately notify the Disclosing Party, in writing, upon the earlier of knowing of any application to obtain any disclosure order or of any disclosure order being granted which would require disclosure of any part or all of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, in challenging the disclosure order or obtaining a protective order.

4. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES
4.1 This Agreement is not intended to and does not obligate either Party:
(a) to disclose any specific Confidential Information; or
(b) to enter into any subsequent business arrangements regarding the Permitted Purpose or any other matter.
4.2 This Agreement does not create any exclusivity between the Parties; each Party remains free to negotiate and enter into any agreement with any third party covering all or any part of the Permitted Purpose without any liability to the other Party under this Agreement.

(b) subject to subsection 5.3(c), make its best efforts to delete all electronic copies of the Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party;
(c) safeguard any electronic Confidential Information that cannot be destroyed due to the Receiving Party’s archiving practices or policies with the same degree of care as it would its own Confidential Information; and
(d) retain electronic Confidential Information described in subsection 5.3(c) only for the period it normally maintains such records, which electronic Confidential Information shall remain subject to the provisions of this Agreement until destroyed.
5.4 Notwithstanding anything in section 5.3, the Receiving Party shall not be obliged to return or destroy any derivative materials or reports prepared by the Receiving Party for the Permitted Purpose, which materials and reports shall nonetheless remain subject to the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement.
5.5 Upon request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that it has complied with section 5.3.
6. REMEDIES
6.1 Each Party acknowledges that monetary damages would be inadequate to protect the other Party against any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, and, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the other Party, agrees to the granting of injunctive relief in favour of the other Party without proof of actual damages.
6.2 The Receiving Party shall indemnify the Disclosing Party against any loss or damage suffered by the Disclosing Party as a result of the failure of the Receiving Party or such other persons who are disclosed Confidential Information under this Agreement to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

9.2 This Agreement is not intended to and does not grant, expressly or by implication, any right or license to any permit, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, improvement, or any other intellectual property right or similar proprietary right of any kind that the other Party may possess.
9.3 Neither Party's failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof.
9.4 Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in all or part of this Agreement, including assignment by operation of law or otherwise, without such consent. Either Party may grant or withhold consent in its sole discretion. The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any permitted successor of either Party.

2. As a condition to receiving the Confidential Information, the Recipient agrees to treat confidentially, and not to disclose, and to cause the Recipient’s Representatives to treat confidentially and not disclose (except as permitted herein), any Confidential Information.
3. The Recipient hereby recognizes and acknowledges the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that would result to the Company, if any of the Confidential Information is disclosed to any third party. Accordingly, the Recipient hereby agrees that the Confidential Information will be used solely for the Permitted Purpose and not any other purpose.
4. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to the limited group of the Recipient's Representatives, who are actually engaged in and need to know the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, who have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and who agree to keep such information confidential and not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Permitted Purpose. The Recipient shall ensure that each of the Recipient's Representatives will observe all terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient further agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of the Recipient's Representatives, and that the Recipient shall take all reasonable measures, including, without limitation, court proceedings, at the Recipient’s sole expense, to restrain the Recipient’s Representatives from making unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.
5. The Confidential Information shall remain at all times the property of the Company. No rights to use, license, or otherwise exploit the Confidential Information are granted to the Recipient, by implication or otherwise, by virtue of Confidential Information being made available to the Recipient or any of the Recipient’s Representatives.
6. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Company would not have an adequate remedy at law and would be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information or in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Recipient and the Recipient’s Representatives in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to the Receiver, the Recipient agrees that the Receiver shall be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives.

In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives have breached this Agreement, then the Recipient shall be liable and pay to the Receiver the reasonable costs and expenses (including attorney's fees on a full indemnity solicitor and his own client basis) incurred by the Receiver in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom. The Recipient shall indemnify and hold harmless the Receiver and the Receiver's directors, officers, employees, consultants, representatives, advisors and agents from all damages and losses of any nature whatsoever (including consequential damages) arising out of a breach by the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
7. The Recipient agrees that the Receiver shall not disclose to the Recipient or any of the Recipient’s Representatives information about identifiable individuals forming part of the Confidential Information (""Personal Information"") unless required by the Recipient, acting reasonably, for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction. If Personal Information is provided to the Recipient, then:
(a) the Recipient shall comply with the Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5, as amended, and any similar provincial legislation governing the protection of personal information in the private sector applicable to the Recipient in the course of collecting, using and disclosing Personal Information in connection with the Transaction;
(b) prior to the closing of the Transaction (the ""Closing""), the Recipient shall: (i) collect and use Personal Information only for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction; (ii) only disclose Personal Information to those of the Recipient’s Representatives who need to know such Personal Information for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction; and (iii) use appropriate security measures to safeguard all Personal Information against unauthorized collection, access, use or disclosure; and
(c) if the Transaction proceeds, following the Closing, the Recipient shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use or disclose Personal Information obtained as a result of the Transaction only for purposes of carrying on the business conducted by the Company or the carrying out of the objects for which the Transaction took place or otherwise for purposes for which such Personal Information was collected by the Company, unless the consent for other use or disclosure has been obtained from the individuals to whom such Personal Information relates has been obtained as permitted or required by law.
8. In the event you or any of the Recipient's Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand, order or other legal process) to disclose any of the contents of the Confidential Information, or either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction between the Receiver and you, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof, the Company agrees that you and the Recipient's Representatives may do so without liability, provided you (i) cooperate with the Receiver in any attempts it may make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Confidential Information, and (ii) if no protective order is obtained and disclosure is required, (a) furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that, in your counsel's opinion, you are legally compelled to disclose, and (b) take all reasonable measures to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.
9. The Receiver may elect at any time to terminate further access by the Recipient to the Confidential Information. If at any time the Recipient determines not to proceed with the possible Transaction, the Recipient will promptly notify the Receiver in writing. Following any request by the Receiver or any of its Representatives, the Recipient agrees (i) to promptly re-deliver to the Receiver all written Confidential Information and any other written material containing or reflecting any of the Confidential Information in the possession of the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives, (ii) the Recipient and the Recipient's Representatives will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part, mechanical or electronic, of such written material, and (iii) all Notes prepared by the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives will be destroyed, with all such destruction being confirmed by the Recipient to the Receiver in writing.
10. Except to the extent necessary to carry out the Permitted Purpose, none of the Recipient or its Representatives are allowed to make copies of Confidential Information without the prior written approval of the Receiver (excepting that copies made by virtue of electronic communications or storage or printed copies for review by a permitted individual shall not be a breach of this prohibition).
11. Notwithstanding Section 9 or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Recipient and its Representatives are not required to destroy any computer files containing the Confidential Information that are created during automatic computer system backup, provided that such files are stored securely by the Recipient and its Representatives, cannot be destroyed without undue efforts, and access to such files are limited. With respect to such backup computer files, the non-use and confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall apply in perpetuity and survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
12. If the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives are provided with physical access to any properties or facilities of the Company, the Recipient agrees that neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient’s Representatives shall have, and shall not make, any claims whatsoever against the Receiver, or any of its Representatives as a result of such access including, without limitation, any and all claims and causes of action for personal injury, death or property damage occurring as a result of the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives' access to such properties or facilities and the Recipient agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Receiver, or any of its Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, claims and causes of action for personal injury, death or property damage occurring on or to such property or facility as a result of entry onto the premises by the Recipient or any of the Recipient’s Representatives. You shall, and shall cause your Representatives to, comply fully with all rules, regulations and instructions issued by the Receiver regarding you or the Recipient's Representatives' access to such properties or facilities.
13. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Receiver nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees that neither the Receiver nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives relating to or resulting from use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or the Recipient’s Representatives. The Recipient further understands and agrees that (i) the Receiver (a) shall be free to conduct the process for a Transaction as it in its sole discretion shall determine (including changing or terminating such process, providing any information to any other Person, negotiating with any other Person or entering into a Definitive Agreement with any other Person with respect to any transaction, in each case, at any time and without notice to you or any other Person) and (b) shall be free at its sole discretion to at any time accept or reject any proposal relating to the Assets for any reason without notice to you or any other Person, and (ii) the Recipient shall have no claim against the Receiver or any of its Representatives in connection with any of the foregoing.
14. The Recipient hereby represents and warrants that it is not bound by the terms of any agreement with a third party that would conflict with any of the Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement.
15. In accepting and reviewing the Confidential Information, the Recipient represents and warrants that it is acting solely for itself. Further, the Recipient represents and warrants that neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient's Representatives have discussed or shared, and the Recipient hereby covenants that unless it has first received the written consent of the Receiver neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient's Representatives will discuss or share, with any third party any aspect of the Confidential Information, except in accordance with Section 4 or 8 of this Agreement. The Recipient acknowledges that the effect of this covenant is that without the full disclosure to and the written consent of the Receiver, neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient's Representatives can act as agent, partner, co-participant or co-venturer for any third party or third parties with respect to a proposed Transaction. In order to obtain the consent of the Receiver, which the Receiver is entitled to withhold in its sole discretion, the Recipient shall notify the Receiver of the identity of each Person for whom or with whom the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives had considered pursuing a possible Transaction and the nature and interest the Recipient or any of the Recipient's Representatives and each such Person would have in respect of such possible Transaction.
16. The Recipient agrees that, unless and until a Definitive Agreement is entered into between the Receiver and the Recipient with respect to the Transaction, neither the Receiver nor the Recipient will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any Definitive Agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.
17. The Recipient agrees that all (i) communications regarding the Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed only to the Receiver. The Recipient further agrees that under no circumstances will the Recipient or the Recipient's Representatives discuss or otherwise communicate any aspect of the Transaction to any member of the management of the Company without the express written permission of the Receiver. Without the Receiver's prior written consent, the Recipient shall not, and shall direct the Recipient's Representatives not to, make any contact of any nature regarding a proposed Transaction (including inquiries or requests concerning Confidential Information) with any employee, supplier, customer, creditor, bank or other lender of or to the Company or any of its Affiliates.
18. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or electronic transmission and in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement.
19. The Recipient agrees that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable in order to protect the legitimate interests of the Receiver and the Company and all defences to the strict enforcement of the restrictions by the Receiver are hereby waived by the Recipient.
20. If any term or provision of this Agreement is declared to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be deemed to be severable from the rest of this Agreement and it shall not affect or impair the enforceability or validity of any other covenant or provision of this Agreement.
21. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws in force in the Province of Alberta. The Recipient hereby irrevocably attorns to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Alberta for the determination of all matters arising hereunder in the event the Receiver should bring an action on this Agreement in the Courts of the Province of Alberta. The Recipient hereby agrees that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiver may bring an action on this Agreement in any jurisdiction where the Recipient has assets or in any jurisdiction where this Agreement has been breached or where a breach is threatened, and in such an event, the Recipient hereby irrevocably attorns to the jurisdiction of the Courts of such jurisdictions for the determination of all matters arising hereunder.
22. This Agreement will continue indefinitely, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Receiver.
23. No waiver of any particular requirement hereunder shall be construed as a general waiver of this Agreement, and any failure by or delay by the Receiver in enforcing its rights against any particular breach of this Agreement shall not limit or affect its rights to enforce its rights against any other breach hereof.
24. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Recipient without the prior written consent of the Receiver.
25. This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of the Receiver and its successors and assigns and shall be binding upon the Recipient and its successors and permitted assigns.
26. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior contracts, agreements and understandings pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement. No modification or alteration of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. There are no representations, warranties, collateral agreements or conditions affecting this transaction other than as are expressed or referred to herein in writing.
27. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the rights or remedies available to the Receiver at law, in equity or under statute arising in any way in connection with the disclosure of the Confidentiality Information in the event of a breach or a threatened breach of this Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have executed this Agreement on the day and year first above written.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between ______________________________________ (“VENDOR”) and Arkansas State University (“UNIVERSITY”).
WHEREAS, the parties wish to confirm their understandings with respect to the confidential nature of the relationship between the parties relating to the transmission, use, and protection of certain confidential data, it is hereby agreed as follows:
1. Confidential Information. VENDOR acknowledges that in the course of providing services to UNIVERSITY, VENDOR will be given or have access to confidential student and/or employee information (“Confidential Information”) protected from disclosure by privacy laws. VENDOR, its employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors shall, in addition to their respective obligations hereunder, use best efforts at all times to adopt and follow procedures and practices to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and prevent its disclosure to others without the express written consent of UNIVERSITY.
VENDOR specifically, acknowledges Federal privacy laws such as Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Title 15, United States Code, Sections 6801(b) and 6805(b)(2)) applicable to financial transactions and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (Title 20, United States Code, Section 1232g) applicable to student records and information from student records.
VENDOR further acknowledges that UNIVERSITY’S willingness to disclose Confidential Information to VENDOR is predicated on VENDOR entering into committing to abide by the terms of this Agreement and all applicable privacy laws.
2. Nondisclosure. VENDOR, its employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall use the Confidential Information solely in connection with performance by VENDOR of the services provided to UNIVERSITY and for no other purpose. Neither VENDOR nor any of its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors shall sell, release, transfer, reprint, duplicate, recreate, disclose or permit the disclosure to any other person or entity of any of the Confidential Information or of any files, compilation, study, report, or analysis or data base containing, based on, or derived from the Confidential Information without the express written consent of UNIVERSITY and in full compliance with applicable state and federal privacy laws.
VENDOR shall maintain the privacy of protected personal information and shall be financially responsible, if and to the extent that any security breach relating to protected personal information results from acts or omissions of VENDOR, or its personnel, for any notifications to affected persons (after prompt consultation with UNIVERSITY), and to the extent requested by UNIVERSITY, administratively responsible for such notification.
3. Disclosure Sought Under Legal Process. VENDOR shall immediately notify UNIVERSITY in writing of any subpoena, court order, or other legal process seeking or purporting to compel disclosure of any of the Confidential Information and shall challenge, oppose, or appeal any such subpoena, order, or legal process to the extent deemed appropriate by UNIVERSITY. In no event shall VENDOR voluntarily, without a court order, disclose or permit the disclosure of any of the Confidential Information in response to legal process unless and until VENDOR has given the required notice to UNIVERSITY and VENDOR has exhausted any and all legal remedies available to it to limit or prevent the disclosure.
4. Return of Materials. Upon request of UNIVERSITY at any time VENDOR shall return all or such part of the Confidential Information as UNIVERSITY may designate to be returned. In addition, upon the completion of the services provided by VENDOR to UNIVERSITY, VENDOR shall return or destroy, as UNIVERSITY may instruct, all Confidential Information in VENDOR’S possession or control, whether in printed, electronic or any other format, including all duplicates and copies thereof of any files, compilation, study, report, analysis, or data base containing, based on or derived from the Confidential Information.
5. Loss of Access. VENDOR’S disclosure of Confidential Information to third parties without UNIVERSITY’S authorization, or VENDOR’S failure to return or destroy Confidential Information per Provision 4, above may result in the UNIVERSITY or the U.S. Department of Education denying VENDOR access to Confidential Information for a period of at least five years.
6. Immediate Notice. VENDOR shall give UNIVERSITY immediate notice of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information, or of any breach or threatened breach by VENDOR, or its employees, agents, contractors, or subcontractors of their obligations under this Agreement, upon learning of same.
7. Appropriate Forum. VENDOR and UNIVERSITY agree that this Agreement is entered into in the State of Arkansas and that the legal forums located in the State of Arkansas are the appropriate forums in the event any party seeks legal action or injunctive relief under this Agreement. Both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in the appropriate forum in the State of Arkansas.
8. Termination. This Agreement shall survive the termination of the services to be provided by VENDOR or any other agreement by and between the parties.
9. Severability. All of the provisions of this agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is rendered invalid or unenforceable by State or Federal statute or regulations or declared null and void by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
10. Entire Agreement Amendments. This Agreement is intended as the complete, final and exclusive statement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between the parties hereto. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written agreement signed by VENDOR and UNIVERSITY. Any waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement must be in writing signed by the party granting such waiver and shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to perform.
11. Original Copy. Signed originals of this agreement will be kept on file in the Office of the Information Technology, Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas. Copy of signed originals will be provided to VENDOR.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound, the parties have executed this Agreement by their duly authorized representatives.

a) Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its Subsidiaries without Discloser’s consent, if and to the extent such disclosure is required in order to fulfill the Purpose; and
b) a disclosure to or by a party’s respective Subsidiaries shall be considered as disclosure to or by the respective party; and
c) each party is responsible and liable for its respective Subsidiaries’ compliance and due delivery of the obligations set out in this agreement.
2.3 For the purposes of this agreement, “Subsidiaries” shall mean any subsidiary, in which a party holds, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the controlling or voting rights.
3 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND COMPENSATION
3.1 The parties will compensate each other for any damages arising from the breach of the present agreement. The parties hereby acknowledge that the unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information could cause irreparable damage and substantial disadvantage to the parties or their current or future customers which may be difficult to determine. Therefore, the parties agree that the party which has suffered a disadvantage shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies that it may have, to seek injunctive relief in order to enforce the obligations under the agreement.
3.2 In addition and regardless of negligence or fault or proof of an actual damage, the parties agree to contractual penalty in the amount of EUR 15,000.00 for the event of a breach of this agreement. Further claims of the injured party remain unaffected.

Disclosure of the Confidential Information may be made only to employees, agents or independent contractors of a Party who are directly involved in consideration of the transaction, which is the subject of this Agreement and who are bound to maintain its confidence.
2. Definition of Confidential Information. The term ""Confidential Information"" shall mean for purposes of this Agreement, any and all sensitive business, financial and technical information provided prior to the execution of this Agreement and to be provided after the execution of this Agreement by a transmitting Party to the receiving Party, including, without limitation, financial statements, reports and data, customer lists, trade secrets, technical data, proprietary information, and any other confidential information regarding the transmitting Party, its subsidiaries and its respective businesses.

Both parties shall exercise reasonable and prudent security procedures to protect such information, reports, returns and other documentation in their possession, including electronic versions thereof, from any unauthorized access and/or disclosure. Access to the information covered by this agreement shall be limited to the minimum number of individuals necessary to achieve the stated purpose of the agreement.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this agreement, any breach of the confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions above shall be grounds for immediate termination of this agreement without notice, and legal action may be immediately commenced.
Disposal of Confidential Information
Once confidential information or data obtained hereunder is no longer useful for the purposes described herein, Authorized Person agrees to immediately destroy all such confidential information or data maintained on any information system platform or any form of storage media subject to any schedule of retention established by the Kansas Records Board, in the following manner:

Printed material to be burned must be burned in an incinerator that produces enough heat to burn the entire bundle, or the bundle must be separated to ensure that all pages are incinerated. Printed material to be shredded must be shredded in the following manner: The paper must be inserted so that lines of print are perpendicular to the cutting line; The paper must be shredded to effect 5/16-inch-wide or smaller strips. Consideration should be given to the use of cross-cut shredders; If shredding deviates from the 5/16-inch specification, Confidential information must be safeguarded until it reaches the stage where it is rendered unreadable through additional means, such as burning or pulping.
Confidential information obtained pursuant to this agreement that is stored in electronic format must be destroyed in the following manner: Electronic media (e.g., hard drives, tapes, CDs, and flash media) must be destroyed according to IRS Publication 1075 guidance in Section 9.3.10.6, Media Sanitization (MP-6), and Section 9.4.7, Media Sanitization.

"DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
I, _______________________________________, an individual official, employee, consultant, or subcontractor of or to _____________________ (the Authorized Entity), intending to be legally bound, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional access to certain information, specified below, that is owned by, produced by, or in the possession of the United States Government.
(Signer will acknowledge the category or categories of information that he or she may have access to, and the signer’s willingness to comply with the standards for protection by placing his or her initials in front of the applicable category or categories.)
Initials:
Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII)
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with all requirements of the PCII program set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (CII Act) (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135, 6 USC 101 et seq.), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (6 CFR Part 29), as amended, and the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and with any such requirements that may be officially communicated to me by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee.
Initials:
Sensitive Security Information (SSI)
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of SSI information as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with 49 CFR Part 1520, “Protection of Sensitive Security Information,” “Policies and Procedures for Safeguarding and Control of SSI,” as amended, and any supplementary guidance issued by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security.
Initials:
Other Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU)
As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is an over-arching term that covers any information, not otherwise indicated above, which the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to or modification of could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Section 552a of Title 5, as amended, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This includes information categorized by DHS or other government agencies as: For Official Use Only (FOUO); Official Use Only (OUO); Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI); Limited Official Use (LOU); Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES); Safeguarding Information (SGI); Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI); and any other identifier used by other government agencies to categorize information as sensitive but unclassified.
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of the information to which I am granted access as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with the guidance provided to me relative to the specific category of information.
I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions of my access to the information indicated above:
1. I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination concerning the nature and protection of information to which I have been provided conditional access, including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures.
 2. By being granted conditional access to the information indicated above, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access.
3. I attest that I understand my responsibilities and that I am familiar with and will comply with the standards for protecting such information that I may have access to in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and/or directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access. I understand that the United States Government may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling and safeguarding information under this Agreement.
4. I will not disclose or release any information provided to me pursuant to this Agreement without proper authority or authorization. Should situations arise that warrant the disclosure or release of such information I will do so only under approved circumstances and in accordance with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I will honor and comply with any and all dissemination restrictions cited or verbally relayed to me by the proper authority.
5. (a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession.
(2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager’s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended.
(b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information.
6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original.
7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.
8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information.
9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
(b) With respect to PCII I hereby assign to the entity owning the PCII and the United States Government, all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of PCII not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.
11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter.
12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies.
14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.
15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.
16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement.
17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.

PARTIES
(1) Partner Ireland Insurance Limited of 5th Floor, Block 1, The Oval, 160 Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4, Ireland and registered in Ireland with company number 395190.
(2) Individual(s) submitting information via the interactive e-handshake on partnerre.com Each a “Party” and collectively referred to as the “Parties”.
BACKGROUND
In order to allow the Parties to engage in insurance mediation activities (the “Business Under Discussion”) the Parties have agreed to enter into this non-disclosure / confidentiality agreement (the “Agreement”) with respect to all Information (as hereinafter defined) furnished by one Party (the “Providing Party”) to the other (the “Receiving Party”). The execution of this Agreement does not constitute the creation of a business relationship.
IT IS AGREED
1. The Receiving Party agrees to treat all information provided by the Providing Party in connection with the Business Under Discussion to the Receiving Partner and/or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees, affiliates, insurers, agents, advisors or auditors (the “Representatives”), regardless of the manner in which it is so furnished, together with any analyses, compilations, data, studies or other documents or records, whether of an oral, written or electronically retrievable nature (collectively the “Information”), as strictly confidential.
2. The Receiving Party shall limit the possession and use of the Information to a “need-to-know” basis among its Representatives.
3. Information does not include, however, information which (a) is or becomes generally available to the public; (b) was available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the Providing Party; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party; or (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis after the date hereof from a third party which was not known by the Receiving Party to be subject to a confidentiality agreement with the Providing Party and which is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Receiving Party.
4. The Receiving Party agrees that the Information will be used solely for giving effect to the Business Under Discussion and further that it will not disclose to any person (i) the Information and (ii) the fact that the Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or that the Receiving Party have inspected any portion of the Information, for any reason or purpose whatsoever, unless the Providing Party has consented in writing to such disclosure or except as stated otherwise herein or as required by law, order, decree, regulation, or governmental agency request. The term “person” as used in these provisions shall be broadly interpreted to include without limitation any corporation, company, partnership, individual or group.
5. In the event that the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any of the Information, the Receiving Party agrees that it will provide the Providing Party with prompt written notice of such request(s) prior to the required disclosure and the Providing Party shall use reasonable efforts, at its own expense, to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained and a waiver hereunder is not received, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Information which is legally required and shall use its best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Information.
6. If any of the Parties determine that they do not wish to proceed or continue with the Business Under Discussion, it will promptly advise the other Party of that decision in writing or by email. Upon receipt of such communication the Receiving Party shall destroy promptly all documents furnished and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to retain that portion of the Information for legal, regulatory or internal compliance purposes, which will continue to be treated as confidential on the terms hereof.
7. The Parties agree and understand that, notwithstanding any pending or future disputes between them or any claims relating to or arising from such disputes, the provision of the Information is not intended to and should not be construed as a waiver of any confidentiality or privilege over such material for any other purpose and such confidentiality and privileges are expressly reserved.
8. Any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement shall constitute a breach that may cause irreparable injury, not readily measurable in money, and for which the Providing Party, without waiving any other rights or remedies at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief. Any such right or remedy and any and all other rights or remedies provided for herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive and in addition to any and all other rights or remedies which the Providing Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.
9. The Parties agree that, in the event of loss or damage to the Providing Party as a result of breach of the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be liable only in respect of loss or damage resulting directly from the breach, and no liability will be accepted in respect of any special, indirect, incidental or consequential losses or damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits or revenue) suffered by the Providing Party or any person connected with the Providing Party, arising out of the performance or breach of this Agreement, whether claims for said losses or damages are premised on contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise.
10. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by any of the Parties to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. No modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is in writing and signed by each of the Parties. There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
11. This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales without giving effect to conflict of law principles, and the Parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
12. This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between the Parties relating to the non-disclosure of information.","nondisclosure, confidentiality, agreement, partner, ireland, insurance,

(Generic NDA provided by Pitch Deck Fire)
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as on _________________ (“Effective Date”), by and between ____________________, (“the Disclosing Party”) and ___Pitch Deck Fire___, (“the Recipient”) (collectively, “the Parties”).
Purpose for Disclosure (“Business Purpose”): Relevant information will be disclosed by the
Disclosing Party to the Recipient for the purposes of providing a quote for services and for providing services, generally the completion of a pitch deck or similar materials by the Recipient for Disclosing Party’s use at their discretion. Products of services also fall under this non-disclosure agreement, with the sole exception that the Recipient can use products of services as portfolio examples on the Pitchdeckfire.com website or otherwise, provided that the images are in a non-editable format, and scrubbed clean of branding and specific content (blurred out all logos, company and industry specific content), unless contrary written permission is given by the disclosing party.
The Parties hereby agree as follows:
1. For purposes of this Agreement, ""Confidential Information"" shall mean any and all non-public information, including, without limitation, technical, developmental, marketing, sales, operating, performance, cost, know-how, business plans, business methods, and process information, disclosed to the Recipient. For convenience, the Disclosing Party may, but is not required to, mark written Confidential Information with the legend ""Confidential"" or an equivalent designation.
2. All Confidential Information disclosed to the Recipient will be used solely for the Business Purpose and for no other purpose whatsoever. The Recipient agrees to keep the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information confidential and to protect the confidentiality of such Confidential Information with the same degree of care with which it protects the confidentiality of its own confidential information, but in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information only to its employees, agents, consultants and contractors on a need-to-know basis, and only if such employees, agents, consultants and contractors have executed appropriate written agreements with Recipient sufficient to enable Recipient to enforce all the provisions of this Agreement. Recipient shall not make any copies of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as needed for the Business Purpose. At the request of Disclosing Party, Recipient shall return to Disclosing Party all Confidential Information of Disclosing Party (including any copies thereof) or certify the destruction thereof.
3. All right title and interest in and to the Confidential Information shall remain with Disclosing Party or its licensors. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to Recipient under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets of Disclosing Party. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ""AS IS"". THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
4. The obligations and limitations set forth herein regarding Confidential Information shall not apply to information which is: (a) at any time in the public domain, other than by a breach on the part of the Recipient; or (b) at any time rightfully received from a third party which had the right to and transmits it to the Recipient without any obligation of confidentiality.
5. In the event that the Recipient shall breach this Agreement, or in the event that a breach appears to be imminent, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to all legal and equitable remedies afforded it by law, and in addition may recover all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred in seeking such remedies. If the Confidential Information is sought by any third party, including by way of subpoena or other court process, the Recipient shall inform the Disclosing Party of the request in sufficient time to permit the Disclosing Party to object to and, if necessary, seek court intervention to prevent the disclosure.
6. The validity, construction and enforceability of this Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the law of the state of Colorado. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the respective Parties. This Agreement shall control in the event of a conflict with any other agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and covenants herein contained, it is agreed as follows:
1. Definitions
For the purpose of the present Agreement, “Material” is defined as any data, test, study or any information in support of the Registration under REACH made available to the Consortium or generated or determined or used in any way by the Consortium to comply with the requirements of REACH and provided to the Receiving Party for the purpose of registration under REACH. This Material shall include, without limitation: (i) Data and/or Studies acquired, licensed, developed or contracted or obligated for by the Consortium pursuant to Section 10 of the Consortium Agreement; (ii) Registration Dossier - technical dossier comprising studies, including test results; study summaries; proposals for testing; classification and labelling; guidance on safe use; plus a chemical safety report; and (iii) draft Registration Dossier, interim and working documents related to the preparation of the Registration Dossier, know-how, technical information, researches, methods, practices, procedures, processes, formulas and more generally any information with respect to substances that is made available, in written or oral form, to the Receiving Party by the Consortium and/or the Consortium Members. Unless defined herein, the definitions in this Agreement shall be the same as those set forth in the Consortium Agreement.
2. Non-disclosure and Restriction on Use
The Receiving Party agrees to retain the Material in confidence and not to use the Material for any purpose other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and of the Consortium Agreement.
In Particular, the Receiving Party undertakes (in addition and without prejudice to any commitments under the Consortium Agreement), that:
a. the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Material to any Third Party except with the Steering Committee’s prior written consent and provided that no other legal disclosure requirement applies;
b. the Material shall neither be copied, nor otherwise reproduced nor duplicated in whole or in part where such copying, reproduction or duplication have not been specifically authorized by the Consortium Agreement or otherwise approved in writing by the Steering Committee;
The Receiving Party acknowledges that the covenants of non-disclosure and non-use in this Agreement shall be effective in every country in the world.
The Receiving Party shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or improper use of the Material, to prevent the material from falling into the public domain, and to protect it from falling into the possession of Third Parties. Such measures include, but shall not be limited to, the highest degree of care that the Receiving Party utilises to protect its own confidential information. In the event of loss or theft of any documents, items of work in progress, or any work products embodying Material, the Consortium Secretariat must be notified immediately by the Receiving Party, who shall cooperate fully in remedying same.
3. Permitted Disclosure of Material
a. The Receiving Party shall solely disclose the Material to its affiliates, employees and persons in the Receiving Party’s organization who (i) have responsibility for or are directly concerned with the purposes of this Agreement and of the Consortium Agreement; (ii) are subject to non-disclosure or confidentiality obligations to the Receiving Party (the Material constituting protected information for purposes of such obligations); and (iii) have been informed and are fully aware of the Receiving Party’s obligations under this agreement and under the Consortium Agreement.
b. The Receiving Party may provide its customers with (i) Safety Data Sheets as defined in Article 31 of REACH, (ii) relevant exposure scenarios, or (iii) other available and relevant information about the substance that is necessary to enable appropriate risk management measures to be identified and applied.
c. The Receiving Party may disclose the Material if and to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or court order, provided that the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party. Any disclosure of Data and/or Studies that could result in public disclosure of the Data and/or Studies shall only be permissible after prior approval from the Steering Committee or the IMOA Executive Committee.
d. The Receiving Party and its Affiliates may use the Material for compliance with laws and regulations in other non-EU jurisdictions provided that the confidentiality of the Material is guaranteed and in compliance with the NDA. Any disclosure of the Data and/or Studies for the purposes of compliance with non-EU regulatory requirements that could result in public disclosure of the Data and/or Studies shall only be permissible after prior approval from the Steering Committee or the IMOA Executive Committee.
e. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall prevent an Individual Member from supplying Data and/or Studies in its possession or control to a Governmental Authority where required to do so by law or regulation and where refusing to do so would require the Individual Member to violate that law or regulation and subject the Individual Member to fines or other sanction by the Governmental Authority.
4. Exceptions to Non-Disclosure
The Receiving Party shall not be subject to the obligations of this Agreement with respect to Material which:
a. is or becomes known publicly through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party; or
b. was already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure hereunder as shown by the Receiving Party’s prior written records; or

f. is approved for release by written authorisation of the Steering Committee or the IMOA Executive Committee; or
g. is publicly disclosed in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 of the Consortium Agreement.
5. Term
This Agreement shall survive until the earlier of (i) such time as all the material disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known pursuant to Section 15 of the Consortium Agreement and made generally available without violation of this Agreement, or (ii) twelve (12) years from date of Registration.
6. No Licence
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to the Receiving Party under any patent, copyright or any other intellectual property right, nor shall this Agreement grant the Receiving Party any rights in or to the material except as expressly set forth herein and in the Consortium Agreement.
7. Indemnity
The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Consortium and its Members. Should the Receiving Party violate any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Consortium Members shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that maybe available, in law, in equity or otherwise, to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.
In addition, in case of violation of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may be expelled from the Consortium in accordance with the conditions provided in Section 4 of the Consortium Agreement.
8. Waiver
No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder.
9. Severability
If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such circumstance shall not affect any other provision of the Agreement and the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and be construed as if such provision, to the extent that it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, had never been contained herein or therein.
10. Governing Law and disputes
This Agreement shall be governed by, and all disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
11. Amendment
No modifications, change, or waiver of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by authorised representatives of the Individual Members.

"LAST MAN STANDS INTERNATIONAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made on ____________________________________ (Date)
BETWEEN
1. Last Man Stands, (the ""Disclosing Party""); and
2. _____________, (the ""Receiving Party""),
Collectively referred to as the ""Parties"".
RECITALS
A. The Receiving Party understands that the Disclosing Party has disclosed or may disclose information relating to Last Man Stands which to the extent previously, presently, or subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party is hereinafter referred to as ""Proprietary Information"" of the Disclosing Party.
OPERATIVE PROVISIONS
1. In consideration of the disclosure of Proprietary Information by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party hereby agrees: (i) to hold the Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its own confidential materials), (ii) not to disclose any such Proprietary Information or any information derived there from to any third person, (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally its relationship with the Disclosing Party, and
(iv) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. The Receiving Party shall procure that its employees, agents and sub-contractors to whom Proprietary Information is disclosed or who have access to Proprietary Information sign a nondisclosure or similar agreement in content substantially similar to this Agreement. For a period of eighteen months following the execution of this agreement to the Receiving Party shall not, directly or indirectly hire, solicit, or encourage to leave the Disclosing Party employment, any employee, contractor or player of the Disclosing Party or hire any such employee or contractor who has left the Disclosing Parties employment, contractual engagement or player within one year of such employment or engagement, the Receiving Party. For a period of three years following the execution of this agreement, the contractor shall not start up his/her own cricket related business using the customer lists, trade secrets, inventions, innovations, processes, information, records and specifications of the Disclosing Party and/or used by the Disclosing party in connection with the operation of its business including, without limitation, the Disclosing parties business and product processes, methods, accounts and procedures.
2. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information after five years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (i) is or becomes (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any affiliate, agent, consultant or employee) generally available to the public, or (ii) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party as evidenced in writing, except to the extent that such information was unlawfully appropriated, or (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it by a third party, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by law or court order provided the Receiving Party uses diligent reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and has allowed the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order.
3. Immediately upon the written request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will return to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof, save that where such Proprietary Information is a form incapable of return or has been copied or transcribed into another document, it shall be destroyed or erased, as appropriate.
4. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any transaction or relationship.
5. The Receiving Party further acknowledges and agrees that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is or will be made, and no responsibility or liability is or will be accepted by the Disclosing Party, or by any of its respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisers, as to, or in relation to, the accuracy of completeness of any Proprietary Information made available to the Receiving Party or its advisers; it is responsible for making its own evaluation of such Proprietary Information.
6. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal or unenforceable neither the validity, nor enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall be affected. Neither Party shall assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement without the consent of the other Party. This Agreement may not be amended for any other reason without the prior written agreement of both Parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof unless any representation or warranty made about this Agreement was made fraudulently and, save as may be expressly referred to or referenced herein, supersedes all prior representations, writings, negotiations or understandings with respect hereto.
7. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Disclosing Party is located (or if the Disclosing Party is based in more than one country, the country in which its headquarters are located) (the ""Territory"") and the parties agree to submit disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement to the non-exclusive of the courts in the Territory.

The Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to the Confidential Information to those of its officers, directors and employees who clearly need such access in order to participate on behalf of the Receiving Party in the analysis and negotiation of a business relationship or any contract or agreement, or the advisability thereof, with the Disclosing Party and who are bound by written confidentiality agreements that protect third party information.

 THIS MUTUAL NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT is made and entered into this ____day of _________, 20______ between Product Development Experts, Inc. with address at; 2440 SE Federal Hwy., Suite 101-P Stuart FL 34994 and _______________________________________________________________________ (Inventor), with address at; __________________________________________________________________________________
Purpose. The parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and in connection with this opportunity, each party may disclose to the other party certain confidential technical and business information which the disclosing party desires the receiving party to treat as confidential.
""Confidential Information"" means any information disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, including without limitation documents, prototypes, samples, plant and equipment, research, product plans, products, services, customer lists, software, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration, marketing materials or finances, which is designated as ""Confidential,"" ""Proprietary"" or some similar designation. Information communicated orally shall be considered Confidential Information if such information is confirmed in writing as being Confidential Information within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure. Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to a disclosing party by third parties. Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no action or inaction of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party's files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; (v) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving party's possession; or (vi) is required by law to be disclosed by the receiving party, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and assistance in obtaining an order protecting the information from public disclosure.
Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each party shall not use the Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship between the parties. Neither party shall disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties. If any party makes copies of the Confidential Information of the other party, such copies shall also constitute Confidential Information and any and all confidential markings on such documents shall be maintained. Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other tangible objects which embody the other party's Confidential Information and which are provided to the party hereunder.
Maintenance of Confidentiality. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information, and shall promptly notify the disclosing party of any misuse or misappropriation of Confidential Information of which it becomes aware. Each party shall disclose Confidential Information only to those officers, directors, employees and contractors who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship, and such party shall remain responsible for compliance with the terms of this Agreement by its officers, directors, employees and contractors.
No Obligation. Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.
No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ""AS IS."" NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
Paid For Work. All paid for information, work, designs, ideas will become the property of the payor (the person or company paying).
Return of Materials. All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential Information which have been disclosed by either party to the other party, and all copies thereof which are in the possession of the other party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be promptly returned to the disclosing party upon the disclosing party's written request.
No License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any patent, mask work right or copyright of the other party, nor shall this Agreement grant any party any rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other party except as expressly set forth herein.
Term. The obligations of each receiving party hereunder shall survive for a period of five years after the disclosure of the Confidential Information or until such time as all Confidential Information of the other party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving party, whichever is earlier. Parties agree to honor all patent protections.
Remedies. Each party agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the other party, entitling the other party to seek injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies.
Choice of Laws and Forum. The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, U.S.A., as it applies to a contract executed, delivered, and performed solely in such state. Both PARTIES agree that all disputes concerning the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Florida, U.S.A. Furthermore, both PARTIES hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in the State of Florida, U.S.A., for any dispute arising out of a violation of this Agreement, or any attempt to recover losses incurred on such dispute.
Miscellaneous. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11 will be null and void. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without reference to conflict of laws principles. This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other party except as set forth herein. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement, or any of its terms or provisions, will not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, which will at all times remain in full force and effect. A failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision. This Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, except by a writing signed by both parties hereto. Any notices required to be given under this agreement shall be deemed given upon the earlier of receipt of five (5) days after mailing by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery by messenger or express service, to the addresses stated on the first page, or to such other address as the either party may specify to the other in writing form time to time.

xii) approved by the other party for disclosure; or
xiii) required to be disclosed pursuant to a governmental or legal requirement provided that the disclosing party gives to the other party written notice of such requirement prior to any such disclosure.

Upon completion of the Business Purpose and/or upon written request of the party providing the Information, the other party shall within 14 days return all copies of the Information to the providing party or certify in writing that all copies of the Information have been destroyed. Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of either party voluntarily to return the Information, or any part thereof, to the other party at any time.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into on [INSERT DATE], 2016 (“Effective Date”), by and between Media News Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Disclosing Party”) and [NAME OF COMPANY], and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Recipient”). Disclosing Party and Recipient may each be referred to herein as a “Party” and together as the “Parties” to this Agreement.
RECITALS
WHEREAS, for the purpose of assisting the Recipient in evaluating the merits of a potential investment in or other financing of the Disclosing Party (the “Purpose”), Recipient wishes to receive certain information that the Disclosing Party desires to keep confidential relating to its business plan, financial matters, and products and/or services currently under development; and
WHEREAS, the Disclosing Party desires to disclose such information to the Recipient, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants, representations, warranties, agreements and promises hereinafter set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree to the foregoing and as follows:
1. The term “Confidential Information” shall mean any confidential, proprietary, financial or otherwise non-public information, in written or electronic form, relating to the Disclosing Party, or the Purpose that is disclosed before, on or after the Effective Date, by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient or its affiliates, or to any of such Recipient’s or its affiliates’ employees, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents, attorneys, accountants or advisors (collectively, “Representatives”), whether disclosed or accessed in written, electronic or other form, including, without limitation: (a) information concerning the Disclosing Party’s and its affiliates’ business affairs, finances, forecasts, sales and other financial results, records and budgets, and business, marketing, development, sales and other commercial strategies; and (b) notes, analyses, compilations, reports, forecasts, data, statistics, summaries, interpretations and other materials prepared by or for Recipient or its Representatives that contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect or are derived, in whole or in part, from any of the foregoing. Confidential Information provided by Disclosing Party must be expressly marked or designated in writing by the Disclosing Party in a manner to indicate its confidential, proprietary or otherwise non-public nature.
2. Recipient shall protect and safeguard the confidentiality of all such Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Recipient would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care to protect and safeguard the confidentiality of all such Confidential Information.
3. Recipient shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, (a) disclose all or any portion of Confidential Information to any third parties (other than to its Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information to assist Recipient in its evaluation of the Purpose), or (b) use or permit any Confidential Information to be accessed or used for any purpose other than for the evaluation of the Purpose. Recipient will be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement caused by its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Disclosing Party acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Recipient is expressly authorized to disclose the Confidential Information to certain lenders and investors, in furtherance of Recipient’s performance of its obligations with respect to the Purpose and (b) under no circumstances will Recipient have any liability for any disclosure by such lenders or investors of any of the Confidential Information.
4. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall not disclose to any person or entity (other than its Representatives who are involved in its evaluation of the Purpose) any information with respect to the occurrence or content of any discussions or negotiations between the Parties.
5. Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information in the event and to the extent Recipient reasonably believes any Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by Recipient under the terms of: (i) a valid and effective subpoena; (ii) a statute or regulation binding upon Recipient; (iii) an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) by a demand or information request from an executive, regulatory or administrative agency or other governmental authority. Recipient shall endeavor to promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such potential disclosure unless recipient reasonably believes that applicable law prohibits Recipient from informing the Disclosing Party of the potential disclosure.
6. Recipient understands and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any person or entity delivering the Confidential Information on behalf of Disclosing Party is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information furnished or to be furnished by it to Recipient (any representation or warranty with respect thereto must be set forth or provided for in a definitive agreement between the parties, if any is entered into in connection with the Purpose or certification from Disclosing Party).
7. For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall not include any information which (a) is or becomes publicly available, other than through disclosure by Recipient in violation of this Agreement, (b) was known or available to Recipient prior to disclosure pursuant hereto, (c) was independently developed by Recipient without reference to the Confidential Information disclosed to it pursuant hereto, or (d) in the future is received from a third party who, to the knowledge of Recipient at the time of disclosure, is under no obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto.
8. Recipient hereby further agrees that, in the event of its breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party would suffer irreparable harm and the Disclosing Party’s remedies shall include, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, equitable remedies such as specific performance and injunctive relief and shall not be limited to monetary damages. Specifically, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief prohibiting such violation.
9. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights by way of license or otherwise in or to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant hereto. The disclosure or receipt of information pursuant hereto in no way obligates either Party to agree to any business transaction, whether or not relating to the Purpose.
10. Neither Party may assign, transfer or sell any of its rights under this Agreement, or delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party. Each Party understands and agrees that no failure or delay by the other in exercising any of its rights or remedies hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any waiver in any instance constitute a waiver with respect to any other instance.
11. Upon request of the Disclosing Party (which request may be made at any time upon reasonable notice), Recipient will destroy (or, if stored electronically, purge) or deliver to the Disclosing Party all copies of written Confidential Information (except for that portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analysis, compilation, or other documents prepared by Recipient) in Recipient’s possession. That portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analysis, compilations and other documents prepared by Recipient will continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement or shall be destroyed (or, if stored electronically, purged). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient may retain copies of Confidential Information that it reasonably believes it is required to retain under applicable laws, banking regulations and internal policies of which relate to any services provided to the Disclosing Party. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest of (i) one (1) year from the date hereof, (ii) the date all Confidential Information is destroyed by Recipient or returned to the Disclosing Party, or (iii) upon the closing of any transaction between Recipient and the Disclosing Party for credit accommodations or banking services, at which time duties of confidentiality shall be determined by the transaction agreements and applicable law.
12. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be in violation of applicable law, then such provision shall be void and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to the principles of conflict of laws to the extent that such principles would permit or require the application of laws of another jurisdiction. Any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, and both Parties consent to jurisdiction and venue in such courts for purposes of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

It advises the Network and makes recommendations on all important matters of substance (e.g. scientific, industry and end user evaluations).
WHEREAS, Mr./Mrs. … is appointed as a member of the Advisory Council.
WHEREAS, each participant in HySafe may provide own confidential information related to HySafe to the Advisory Council, all such information to be considered as the “Confidential Information”, and whereupon the parties hereto wish to record the terms and conditions upon which this information will be disclosed.
THEREFORE it is hereby agreed as follows:
1 In this agreement:
 “Disclosing Party” shall mean any participant in HySafe.
“Recipient” shall mean Mr./Mrs. ….
 2 Recipient shall hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall take all reasonable and prudent precautions to prevent the Confidential Information from reaching third parties. Recipient shall use the Confidential Information exclusively for HySafe purposes, especially to advice the Governing Board of HySafe.
3 Recipient's obligations under this agreement shall not apply to any information which Recipient can document beyond any reasonable doubt was available to the public or known to or developed by the Recipient prior to the date first above written. These obligations shall cease as to any information which Recipient can document thereafter became or becomes available to the public, otherwise than as a result of disclosure by Recipient or was or is disclosed to Recipient by a party unrelated to Recipient, that does not have a nondisclosure obligation with respect to it. Moreover, Recipient's obligations under this agreement shall not apply to Confidential Information Recipient has a legal obligation to disclose to public authorities under law, regulation or lawful administrative decision.
4 At any time, upon the respective Disclosing Party's request, Recipient shall promptly deliver to the respective Disclosing Party the Confidential Information and all materials relating to or involving Confidential Information (whether prepared by the respective Disclosing Party or otherwise), and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part regarding the Confidential Information. The delivery of such material shall not relieve Recipient of its obligation of confidentiality or other obligations hereunder.

The award of the arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties concerned.
The parties concerned may instead elect to resolve by mediation a dispute or difference arising in connection with this agreement which cannot be settled amicably.
7 Any Disclosing Party may act individually in relation to the Recipient under this Non Disclosure Agreement.
8 This agreement shall come into force after signature of both parties hereto on the Effective Date and shall expire on February 28, 2009. The obligations pursuant to Article 2 shall remain valid for the Recipient even after the end of this agreement for a period of five (5) years thereafter.

1. Each party shall use its reasonable best eﬀorts to keep the other's Conﬁdential Information secret. Each party shall use at least the same degree of care to avoid unauthorized disclosure or use of the other's Conﬁdential Information as it employs with respect to its own Conﬁdential Information of like importance.
2. Neither party has any obligation with respect to any Conﬁdential Information which (a) that party independently develops without reference to the Conﬁdential Information; (b) is or becomes publicly known without a breach of this Agreement by either party or is known prior to the date hereof; (c) is disclosed to it by a third person who is not required to maintain its conﬁdentiality; (d) is approved for release by the other party in writing. The party claiming any of the above exceptions has the burden of proving its applicability.

9. Each party agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by either party, including its agents, directors, or employees, of the provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy in money damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to an injunction against such breach, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to it.

If Sensitive Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly provide a writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Sensitive Information.
2. Exclusions from Sensitive Information.

6. Severability. If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as best to effect the intent of the parties.
7. Integration. This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, representations and understandings. This Agreement may not be amended except in writing signed by both parties.

Ver 1
Adopted by the SAMED Board on:
November 2013
Between
South African Medical Devices Industry Association (SAMED)
And
(who is a Member of the Board of SAMED and/or a member of SAMED Committee)
Hereinafter collectively “the parties”
1. Confidentiality Policy
1.1 The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that confidential matters brought before the Members of the Board of SAMED or any of its committees, are not disclosed until disclosure is properly authorized. SAMED Board and Committee members are in positions of trust towards SAMED as a voluntary membership organization, and such trust may require that elected and appointed persons act with the highest integrity and keep certain information confidential, and avoid conflicts of interest.
1.2 This agreement is designed to provide clarity for each Board Member and Committee Member with regard to confidential matters that come before- or arise out of meetings and matters of the Members of the Board of SAMED or any of its committees, and provides certainty as to how situations of conflict of interest are to be handled.
1.3 Its objective is to address matters of confidentiality in a manner that facilitates the Board, and Committees in maintaining the highest business and ethical standards, protects the integrity of SAMED, the Board, and Committees, allows for appropriate levels of transparency and accountability in matters before the Board, and supports the maintenance of effective relationships among Board Members, SAMED and Committee Members.
2. Definitions
2.1 “Agreement” means this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement
2.2 ""Board"" means the Board of SAMED.
2.3 “Board Members” means members of the Board.
2.4 “Chair” means Chair of the Board.
2.5 ""Committee"" means a committee of the Board.
2.6 ""Committee Members"" means members of any Committee.
2.7 ""Meeting"" means a meeting of the Board or a Committee, as applicable.
2.8 ""Policy"" means this Confidentiality Policy
2.9 “SAMED” means South African Medical Devices Industry Association
2.10 “Vice-Chair”, means Vice-Chair of the Board
3. The information
3.1 ""Information"" shall for the purposes of this agreement include, without limitation, any technical, commercial, scientific information, know-how, trade secrets, processes, machinery, designs, drawings, technical specifications, clients, prospects, historical and forecast financial information, organisational and operational structure and data in whatever form, communicated to the receiving party or acquired by the receiving party from the disclosing party during the course of the parties' association with one another.
4. Confidentiality
4.1 Regular Board meetings are, in the ordinary course of events, not open to the public and/or media.
a) Members of SAMED may on invitation attend Board meetings.
b) Once the Board has dealt with an issue in a board meeting and has decided on that matter, the issue is considered to be accessible to members to the extent of that decision. Matters that are so declared may be accessible to the public at large to the extent so declared by the Board.
c) All decisions that would be accessible to the general membership and/or the public at large will be recorded as such in the Board minutes.
d) If no recordal is made, the matter, discussions and all resolutions should be deemed to be confidential unless declared by the Board by resolution as not confidential.
e) When considering whether matters are confidential or not, the nature of SAMED as a membership organization, the prospects of harm to SAMED (including harm to its reputation, good processes and procedures and good governance), as well as the impact of any such decision on members or groups of members, must, amongst others, be considered.
4.2 The Board also holds in-camera meetings, All present at any in-camera meeting will be bound to keep the proceedings confidential, unless otherwise directed by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors or any committee created by it with a support of the majority. Exiting and re-entering an in camera session will be permitted with the understanding that all present are obligated to keep the proceedings confidential.
4.3 Non-members will be permitted to attend an in-camera session of the Board of Directors or any Committee created by it, only after a motion requesting attendance to an in camera session is approved by a majority vote of members present and voting. External consultants present during such in camera sessions may be required to preserve the confidentiality of discussions during such a session.
4.4 If any person in attendance at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any Committee created by it, held in-camera, shall give notice of their intention not to be bound by the provisions of this by-law of SAMED, and refuse to leave the room when requested to do so, the Chair shall, subject to a resolution of the board supported by a majority vote, adjourn the meeting, after having informed members that it will be reconvened at a time and place of which the offending person will not be notified.
4.5 Committees are advisory to the Board. Only the full Board makes formal decisions. Committee meetings are held in-camera, and their recommendations should not be discussed outside of the Committee or the Board. Discussions with others for the purpose of gathering input for committee consideration are acceptable and each Committee chair would have to exercise discretion and communication that decision to all present during a Committee meeting where an external person is present.

Section I: BES Cyber System Information (BCSI)
For purposes of this Agreement, “BCSI” shall mean: (i) all information designated as such by VELCO, whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether oral, written or recorded/electronic, and regardless of the manner in which it is furnished; and (ii) all reports, summaries, compilations, analyses, notes or other information which contain such information.

3. The Recipient shall exercise reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality and secrecy of the Classified Information, and shall not divulge Classified Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the VELCO.

This information is limited to trade secrets and other proprietary or private information of Disclosing Party or of any third party if disclosed by or through Disclosing Party.
(iii) ""Item"" means any system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly, device, components, product, or machine, work of authorship, or part thereof, or substance which is disclosed by or through Disclosing Party hereunder, which embodies trade secret or other proprietary or private information of Disclosing Party or of any third party if disclosed by or through Disclosing Party.
(iv) ""Matter"" means the project or other matter in connection with which this Agreement is executed. This matter is or relates to the potential acquisition by the Recipient of a controlling ownership interest in the share capital or business of the Disclosing Party.
The parties to this Agreement have agreed as follows:
1. Non-Disclosure. Recipient agrees as follows:
1.1. For a period of three (3) years from the date of entering in to this Agreement, not to disclosure any Information or Item, in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, whether in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party, to any individual, firm or entity, excepting solely an individual who (a) is an officer, director or employee of Disclosing Party or of the Recipient and (b) has a clear need to know for purposes directly related to the Matter.
2. Exclusions. The obligations of a Recipient under Section 1.1 hereof shall not apply to the following:
2.1. Any Information which, at the time of disclosure, is already rightfully possessed by Recipient or is already in the public domain;
2.2. Any Information which, after the disclosure, enters the public domain without any action or fault of Recipient.
2.3. Any Information which is obtained, other than in connection with the Matter, from any individual, firm or entity which had the unrestricted right to disclose it;
2.4. Any Information which is developed independently by Recipient without reference to any Information or Item;
3. Non-Disclosure Agreements from Third Parties. If Disclosing Party gives its written consent to Recipient to disclose Information or Items to a third party, Recipient shall require the third party to execute a non-disclosure agreement in form, and substance satisfactory to Disclosing Party. Recipient shall promptly furnish Disclosing Party with a copy of all such non-disclosure agreements.
4. Notification of Mandatory Disclosure by Recipient. In the event you are required by any legal or civil proceeding to disclose the Information or Items to a third party, you agree to provide prompt notice to the Disclosing Party, so that we might attempt to secure an appropriate protective order, or waive your compliance with this Agreement. You agree to cooperate with the Disclosing Party in its attempts to secure such a protective order.
5. Only One Source of Discussion. You agree that you will only discuss the Matter with Mr. Al Weber, Chief Executive Officer, or Mr. Thomas V. Gilboy, Chief Financial Officer of the Disclosing Party. Under no circumstances will you discuss the Matter, or admit that the Matter has been a topic of discussion with any other employees of the Disclosing Party, or any other third party. In addition, during 2000, you agree not to undertake any unusual efforts to research the business, operations, prospects or finances of the Disclosing Party, where such research efforts would include discussions with any third party, except in the ordinary course of business.
6. Employees. For a period of two (2) years Recipient (or any agent or affiliates of the Recipient) will not have discussions with any ""Covered Employees"" of the Disclosing Party regarding employment opportunities with the Recipient or any of its affiliates. ""Covered Employees"" will include any person who is employed by the recipient as a part or full time employee either as of the date of this Agreement, or persons that subsequently become employees of the Disclosing Party. However, if a person subsequently terminates their employment with the Disclosing Party, then the recipient can have such discussions with that person, after a 5-day waiting period. In addition, if the Recipient published a general posting for employment opportunities in any publication or web site, and one of the Recipient's Covered Employees should respond to the posting, then the Recipient will be free to have such discussions with that person.
7. Survival. This Agreement shall survive the execution of any subsequent contract between the parties hereto, excepting solely if the subsequent contract relates to the Matter and expressly addresses Recipient's non-disclosure obligations with respect to the Matter.
8. Preservation of Markings. Recipient shall not alter or delete any markings on any Information or Item restricting its disclosure, use or reproduction or indicating its proprietary or private status. Recipient shall include all such markings in all copies of any Information which it makes.
9. No Proprietary Right; Return of Information or Items. Nothing herein shall confer upon Recipient any right, title, interest or license whatsoever in or to any Information or Items. At the end of our discussions regarding the Matter, the Disclosing Party has the right to request that the Recipient return all Information or Items to the Disclosing Party.
10. No Obligations regarding any Transaction. Neither party is under any obligation to pursue or conclude a transaction in connection with the Matter. Both parties will bear their own expenses associated with discussions pertaining to the Matter.
11. No Representations or Warranties. The Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranties of any nature regarding the accuracy or completeness of the Information or Items provided to the Recipient at this time.
12. Injunction. In the event of any breach of this Agreement by either party, or any threatened or attempted breach by either party, the other party to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction against the breaching party. Nothing contained herein precludes the other party from pursuing any other remedies available hereunder or at law or equity for such breach, including the recovery of damages.
13. General
13.1. This agreement constitutes the entire, final and complete agreement between the parties relevant to the subject matter hereof, and it supersedes and replaces all written and oral agreements relevant to the subject matter made or existing by and between the parties or their representatives, and there shall be no modifications hereto unless it is in writing signed by the parties.
13.2. Validity, interpretation, performance, remedies, and all other issues relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the internal law of the State of New York.
13.3. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Agreement, dated as of May 21, 1996 is between Granite State Energy, Inc., with offices at 25 Research Drive, Westboro, MA, (""GSEnergy"") and New England Power Company, with offices at 25 Research Drive, Westborough, MA (""Company"").
WHEREAS, the Company and GSEnergy wish to discuss a prospective purchase of power for purposes of the New Hampshire Retail Competition Pilot Program (the ""Prospective Purchase"");
FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, GSEnergy and the Company agree as follows:
1. In connection with the Prospective Purchase, the Company will provide GSEnergy with certain proprietary and commercially sensitive information and develop further such information with GSEnergy (all of the foregoing hereinafter referred to as ""Information"") which it wishes GSEnergy to maintain as confidential. GSEnergy agrees that it will safeguard such Information maintaining it confidential and not using it except for the purposes of such review and analysis.
The term ""Information"" shall mean and includes all information in whatever form, provided for the purpose of GSEnergy's review and analysis, but is not information which:
(a) is in the public domain at the time of disclosure to GSEnergy; or
(b) enters the public domain after disclosure to GSEnergy, except where such entry is the result of a breach by GSEnergy of this Agreement; or
(c) was already in the possession of GSEnergy prior to disclosure to GSEnergy and was not then subject to an obligation of confidence; or
(d) is rightfully disclosed to GSEnergy by a third person.
2. GSEnergy agrees to maintain all Information in secrecy and confidence for a period of seven (7) years from the date of disclosure thereof, using the same degree of care as is used to protect its own Information. In no event will this degree of care be less than a reasonable degree of care.
3. If GSEnergy desires to use individuals not employed by GSEnergy, GSEnergy shall not disclose Information to these individuals without obtaining prior written approval from the Company and having appropriate non-disclosure agreements signed in form and substance satisfactory to the Company.
4. It will not constitute a violation of this Agreement for GSEnergy to disclose Information as required by a governmental body or a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by law, provided that the Company has been given notice of such requirement and been afforded a reasonable opportunity to contest it, if applicable.
5. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable or, if it cannot be so amended without materially altering the intention of the parties, it shall be stricken, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
6. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
7. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute together but one and the same document.
8. All notices from GSEnergy hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to the attention of Mr. Michael J. Hager, New England Power Company, 25 Research Drive, Westborough, MA 01582. All notices from the Company hereunder shall be in writing and delivered to GSEnergy at the above address.

This Agreement, made as of this 27th day of September, 1999 (the ""Effective Date"") by and between Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc., a Vermont corporation headquartered at 30 Community Drive, South Burlington, Vermont 05403 (""Ben & Jerry's"") and Conopco, Inc., with an address at 390 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022 (collectively, the ""Company""), sets forth the terms and conditions of the confidential disclosure of certain information between the parties. The party from time to time disclosing Confidential Information, as herein defined, shall be referred to as the ""Discloser"" with respect to such Confidential Information and the party from time to time receiving such Confidential Information shall be referred to as the ""Recipient"" with respect to such Confidential Information. The terms ""Ben & Jerry's Confidential Information"" and the ""Company's Confidential Information"" shall refer to the Confidential Information disclosed by Ben & Jerry's and the Company as Disclosers, respectively.
In consideration of the premises set forth below and other valuable consideration, the receipt of which in hereby acknowledged by each party, Ben & Jerry's and the Company agree as follows:
1. ""Confidential Information"" shall mean all information disclosed to Recipient by Discloser or its agents or employees in any manner, whether orally, visually or in tangible form (including, without limitation, documents, devices and computer readable media) and all copies thereof, whether created by Discloser or Recipient. Tangible materials that disclose or embody Confidential Information shall be marked, to the extent practicable, by Discloser as ""Confidential,"" ""Proprietary"" or the substantial equivalent thereof.
2. Except as expressly permitted herein, Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information and shall prevent the disclosure of such information by Recipient or its affiliates and their respective employees, directors, counsel, advisors, agents and independent contractors (all of which collectively ""Representatives"") by using the same degree of care to keep confidential the Confidential Information as it uses to keep confidential its own confidential information. In addition, except as permitted herein, Recipient shall not disclose the fact that the parties are exchanging Confidential Information and having discussions. In connection therewith, it is agreed that no public release or disclosure of any contemplated transaction shall be made except by a mutually agreed disclosure except that each party may make such disclosure if advised by its outside securities counsel in writing that such disclosure is required; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in such event such party will notify the other party that it intends, as a preliminary matter, to take such action and the outside securities counsel of such party shall first discuss the mater with the outside securities counsel of the other party before any definitive decision is made on the disclosure.
3. Recipients shall use Confidential Information solely for the purpose (the ""Permitted Purpose"") specified at the end of this Agreement.
4. Recipient shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of its Representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose.
5. Confidential Information shall not include any information that:
(a) was in Recipient's or its Representative's possession prior to disclosure by Discloser hereunder;
(b) was generally known, in the trade or business in which it is practiced by Recipient or its Representatives at the time of disclosure to Recipient or its Representatives hereunder, or becomes so generally known after such disclosure, through no act of Recipient or its employees, agents or independent contractors in violation of this Agreement;
(c) has come into the possession of Recipient or its Representatives from a third party who is not, to Recipient's knowledge, under any obligation to Discloser to maintain the confidentiality of such information;
(d) was developed by Recipient or its Representatives independently of and without reference to Confidential Information.
If a particular portion or aspect of Confidential Information becomes subject to any of the foregoing exceptions, all other portions or aspects of such information shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this Agreement.
6. Recipient agrees not to reproduce or copy by any means Confidential Information, except as reasonably required to accomplish such Recipient's Permitted Purpose. Upon written demand by Discloser at any time, Recipient shall return promptly to Discloser or destroy, at Recipient's option, all tangible materials that disclose or embody Confidential Information except that Recipient's counsel may, upon written notice to Disclosure's counsel, retain a single copy of Confidential Information in its records solely for use in dispute resolution or as otherwise required by law. Recipient shall not remove any proprietary rights legend from, and shall, upon Discloser's reasonable written request, add an appropriate proprietary legend to, materials disclosing or embodying Confidential Information.
7. In the event that Recipient is ordered to disclose Discloser's Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or governmental request, requirement or order, Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser and take reasonable steps at Discloser's expense to assist Discloser in contesting such request, requirement or order or otherwise protecting Discloser's rights.
8. Discloser understands that Recipient is an ice cream manufacturer and engaged in distribution (and with arrangements with distributors or subdistributors) and that planned activities in all such areas that are independently developed, pursued or acquired by the Recipient may contain ideas and concepts similar or identical to those contained in Discloser's Confidential Information. Discloser agrees that entering into this Agreement shall not preclude Recipient from developing, pursuing or acquiring projects similar to Discloser's, without obligation to Discloser, provided Recipient does not breach its obligations to Discloser under this Agreement or use the Confidential Information to develop or pursue such projects. The parties agree that unless and until a definitive written agreement between the Company and Ben & Jerry's has been executed and delivered relating to a specific transaction (which agreement contains customary conditions, representations, warranties and covenants for an agreement of that kind), neither party shall be under any obligation whatsoever with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this or any written or oral communication with respect to such a transaction by it or any of its respective Representatives.
9. The rights and obligations herein shall bind the parties and their successors and assigns. This Agreement expresses the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes al prior oral or written agreements, commitments and understandings pertaining to the subject matter hereof. Any modifications of or changes in this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for two years. Any causes of action accrued on or before the expiration of such period shall survive the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
10. This Agreement and any controversies, disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the parties agree to submit any and all such controversies, disputes, or claims to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in New York, New York.
PERMITTED PURPOSES

Incorporated (""JPM""), or the Company's other representatives furnish to us in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by us, or by our representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or our review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the ""Evaluation Materials""). We recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.
The term ""Evaluation Materials"" includes information furnished to us orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as ""confidential"". The term ""Evaluation Materials"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by us or our representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to us on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to us by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by us. Use of Evaluation Materials
We will not use any to the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. We and our representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may be disclosed to those of our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, ""our representatives"") who we reasonably determine need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between us and the Company (it being understood that our representatives shall be informed by us of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by us, and shall each agree to treat such information confidentially) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither we nor our representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. We will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by our representatives.
In the event that we or any of our representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, we or our representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) we or our representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which we are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise our best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) we shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by us or our representatives not permitted by this Agreement.
Non-Disclosure
The disclosure of our possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, we agree that prior to the execution of a Sale Agreement with respect to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, we will not, and we will direct our representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between us and the Company or any to the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof unless we are advised by counsel that we are required to make such disclosure. The term ""person"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.
Return of Documents
Upon the Company's request, we shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials.
No Unauthorized Contact
During the course of our evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to JPM or employees or representatives of the Company specified by JPM. Accordingly, we agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express consent of JPM, with the exception of direct communication between our chairman and the Company's chairman. We also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by us and such third party without JPM's prior written consent provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not prevent us from soliciting, on a confidential basis, indications of intent form selected third parties for the purchase of portions of the Company.
For a period of two years following the date hereof, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions with whom you have had contact or who became known to you in connection with your consideration of the Possible Transaction, except that you shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (i) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you, (ii) responds to any public advertisement placed by you, or (iii) has been terminated by the Company or its subsidiaries prior to commencement of employment discussions between you and such officer, director, or employee.
Standstill
We agree that until two years from the date of this Agreement, we will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a ""group"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. No Representation or Warranty
Although the Company and JPM have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of our investigation, we acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied hereunder, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to us or any other person hereunder resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by us or any of our representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (""Sale Agreement"") when, as and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.
We also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between us and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, and we hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto. We also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and us with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Sale Agreement"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by us.
No Solicitation
During the period from acceptance of this agreement until the earlier of (a) the execution of a definitive agreement or (b) the date that is 45 days after the date of such acceptance, the Company and the officers, directors, employees and other representatives of the Company including JPM shall not directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage any offers or proposals for the acquisition of the Company, or of any of the capital stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, from third parties (an ""Acquisition Proposal""). The Company, may, however, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide confidential information to, a third party, if the Chairman of the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice from the Company's financial advisor, that such third party has submitted a bona fide proposal or indication of interest that is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal that is financially superior to the non-binding indication of interest contained in the letter of August 7, 1997 from Robert W. Cardy to Paul L. Foster, provided, however, that the Company agrees to inform us of the receipt of any such proposal.
Legal Remedy
We understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
Other
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.
Very truly yours,

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
Each undersigned party (the ""Receiving Party"") understands that the other party (the ""Disclosing Party"") has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party's business particularly relating to uniform informer libraries, chemi-informatic tools and the nature of chemical libraries (including, with limitation, names and expertise of employees and consultants, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics, computer programs, software code, algorithms, development tools, manufacturing capability or processes, chemical routes, chemical structures, relationships with other businesses, business plans, and other technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which to the extent previously, presently, or subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party is hereinafter referred to as ""Proprietary Information"" of the Disclosing Party. Proprietary Information also includes any information which the Disclosing Party has received from a third party which the Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will be considered ""Proprietary Information"" of the Disclosing Party unless either (1) it is first disclosed in tangible form and is conspicuously marked ""Confidential"", ""Proprietary"" or the like or (2) it is first disclosed in non-tangible form and orally identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and is summarized in tangible form conspicuously marked ""Confidential"" within thirty (30) days of the original disclosure.
In consideration of and solely for the purpose of the parties' discussion regarding a possible business transaction and any access the Receiving Party may have to Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, each party (as the Receiving Party) hereby agrees as follows:
1. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Obligations. The Receiving Party agrees (i) to hold the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its most confidential materials), (ii) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person (except consultants or agents, subject to the conditions stated below), (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into a proposed business transaction with the Disclosing Party without the prior written permission of the disclosing party, (iv) not to remove or export from the United States or re-export any such Proprietary Information or any direct product thereof except in compliance with all licenses and approvals required under applicable export laws and regulations, including without limitation, those of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and (v) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee, consultant or agent given access to any such Proprietary Information must have a legitimate ""need to know"" and shall be similarly bound in writing. The parties shall be entitled to exchange Proprietary Information under the terms of this Agreement for a period not to exceed two (2) years from the date hereof, unless otherwise extended by mutual written agreement of the parties or incorporated into a separate agreement. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) shall not apply with respect to all obligations after five (5) years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes generally known to the public, (i) was in its possession or the possession of an affiliate or consultant or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it, an affiliate or a consultant by a third party without restriction, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party by employees of the Receiving Party who can be demonstrated to have had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by court order provided the Receiving Party uses diligent efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate in the proceeding.
2. Patent or Copyright Infringement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights under any patent or copyright of the Disclosing Party, nor shall this Agreement grant the Receiving Party any rights in or to the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, except the limited right to review such Proprietary Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible business transaction.
3. Return of Materials. Immediately upon (i) the decision by either party not to enter into a relationship as a result of the exchange of information hereunder, or (ii) a request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts or derivatives thereof to the extent it is requested by either party in writing, except that a single copy may be retained for legal archival purposes, subject to protection and non-disclosure in accordance with the term of this agreement. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, which shall be disclosed if at all solely at the option of the Disclosing Party, or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any proposed transaction or relationship in connection with which Proprietary Information may be disclosed.
4. No Publicity. Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business relationship contemplated by this Agreement.
5. Securities Law Considerations. Each party is aware, and will advise its employees, consultants and agents who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase and sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
6. Miscellaneous. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow the Receiving Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the Disclosing Party resulting in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the Disclosing Party may seek appropriate equitable relief (without the need to post bond or other security) in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon the occurrence of any such unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be to any extent illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The parties agree that any dispute regarding the interpretation or validity of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in and for the County of San Diego, California, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions and writings and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except in an express writing signed by officers of both parties. No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding upon either party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of such party and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.
Each party warrants to the other that it is duly authorized to enter into this Agreement and that the terms of this Agreement are not inconsistent with any of its respective outstanding contractual obligations. The execution and performance of this Agreement does not obligate the parties to enter into any other agreement or to perform any obligations other than as specified herein.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year set forth below.

"CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality, Non-Disclosure and Restrictive Covenant Agreement, dated as of this 30th day of August, 2005 (this ""Agreement""), by and among (i) Hittite Microwave Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""Hittite""), (ii) HMC Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hittite, (""Buyer"" and, together with Hittite, the ""Buyer Parties""), (iii) Simtek Corporation, a Colorado corporation (""Simtek"") and (iv) Q-Dot, Inc., an Illinois corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Simtek, (the ""Company"" and, together with Simtek, the ""Seller Parties"").
WHEREAS, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof by and among the Buyer Parties and the Seller Parties, the Buyer Parties have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to acquire substantially all the assets of the Company (the ""Acquisition"");
WHEREAS, in partial consideration of the payment of the Purchase Price (as defined at Section 1.7 of the Asset Purchase Agreement) of the Acquisition and in accordance with Sections 4.4 and 6.9 of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Seller Parties agree to enter into this Agreement;
WHEREAS, the Seller Parties acknowledge that the covenants of the Seller Parties set forth in this Agreement are an essential element of the Acquisition and that, but for this Agreement, Buyer Parties would not have entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the Seller Parties possess substantial and intimate knowledge of the business and affairs of the Company and its policies, methods, personnel and operations;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Non-Competition. For a period of four years from the date of this Agreement (the ""Restricted Period""), Seller Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, engage in The Company's Business (as hereinafter defined) or, without the prior written consent of Buyer Parties, directly or indirectly, own an interest in, manage, operate, join, control, lend money or render financial or other assistance to or participate in, as a partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any Person that competes with The Company's Business as it is conducted as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term the ""The Company's Business"" shall mean any business anywhere in the world that provides products or services of the kind provided by the Business (as defined in the Recitals of the Asset Purchase Agreement) as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of this Section 1, ownership of securities having no more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding voting power of any competitor which are listed on any national securities exchange, automated securities exchange (including Nasdaq) or traded actively in the national over-the-counter market (in each case including any foreign equivalent) shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Agreement.
2. Confidentiality. During the Restricted Period and at all times thereafter, Seller Parties will keep and hold all Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) in strict confidence, and will not use or disclose in any way any of such Confidential Information without the prior express written consent of the Buyer Parties. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Confidential Information"" shall mean all trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information (and any tangible representation thereof) owned, possessed or used in connection with The Company Business or by the Buyer Parties and its Affiliates; provided, however, that ""Confidential Information"" does not include information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller Party..
3. Non-Solicitation. During the Restricted Period, Seller Parties agree that they will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of conducting or engaging in any business that competes with The Company Business, call upon, solicit, advise or otherwise do, or attempt to do, business with any customers of the Company engaged prior to the Closing Date (provided that Simtek shall have the right to do business with any of its current or former customers), or interfere with or attempt to interfere with any officers, employees or consultants of the Buyer Parties, induce or attempt to induce any of them to leave the employ of the Buyer Parties or violate the terms of their Contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Buyer Parties, or, without the prior written consent of Buyer Parties, directly or indirectly, solicit to hire, hire or employ, whether as an employee, director, contractor, consultant or otherwise any officers, employees or consultants of the Buyer Parties, unless such Person's employment is terminated by the Seller Parties or its Affiliate; provided, however, that this Section 3 shall not prohibit general solicitations of or advertisements for employment by the Seller Parties that are not generally directed at any officers, employees, representatives or agents of the Buyer Parties, so long as the Seller Parties do not hire any such Person who responds to any such general solicitation or advertisement.
4. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term ""Person"" shall mean an individual, a corporation, an association, a partnership, an estate, a trust and any other entity or organization, (b) the term ""Affiliate"" shall mean with respect to any Person, any Person which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person, and (c) the term ""control"" (including, with correlative meaning, the terms ""controlled by"" and ""under common control with""), as used with respect to any Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
5. Extension of Restricted Period. The Restricted Period shall be extended by the length of any period during which the Seller Parties are in breach of the terms of this Agreement.
6. Amendments and Supplements. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties hereto in any manner, except by an instrument in writing signed by the Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties.
7. No Waiver. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument signed by the party waiving compliance. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.
8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.
9. Notice. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered by hand, sent by facsimile transmission with confirmation of receipt, sent via a reputable overnight courier service with confirmation of receipt requested, or mailed by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested) to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice), and shall be deemed given on the date on which delivered by hand or otherwise on the date of receipt as confirmed:

10. Construction of Agreement. A reference to a Section shall mean a Section in this Agreement unless otherwise expressly stated. The titles and headings herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner limit the construction of this Agreement which shall be considered as a whole. The words ""include,"" ""includes"" and ""including"" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words ""without limitation.""
11. Entire Agreement, Assignability, etc. This Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement and the documents and other agreements among the parties hereto and thereto as contemplated by or referred to herein or therein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein and shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise.
12. Validity. The Seller Parties have independently consulted with their counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and proper. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extension for too great a period of time or over too large a geographic area or over too great a range of activities, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, geographic area or range of activities as to which it may be enforceable. If, after application of the preceding sentence, any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be severable, and after any such severance, all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
13. Remedies. Seller Parties recognize that money damages alone would not adequately compensate Buyer Parties and its Affiliates in the event of breach by Seller Parties of this Agreement, and Seller Parties therefore agree that, in addition to all other remedies available to Buyer Parties and its Affiliates, at law, in equity or otherwise, Buyer Parties and its Affiliates shall be entitled to injunctive relief for the enforcement hereof. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to and not exclusive of any other rights and remedies available, at law, in equity, by agreement or otherwise.
14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as an agreement under seal as of the date first written above.

"NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is made and entered into this 30th day of May, 2001 by and between Hai-Perng, aka Alex Kuo (""Covenantor""), and Vertel Corporation, a California corporation (""Buyer""), and is made with reference to the following:
RECITALS
A. The Company is engaged in the business of development and sales of network management software tools that utilize CORBA as the development platform and provides consulting and related services. The Company has offices in California, New Jersey and Texas.
B. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation, dated May 30, 2001, by and between Trigon Technology Group, Inc., a Texas corporation (the ""Company""), and Buyer (the ""Purchase Agreement""), the Company will sell to Buyer and Buyer will purchase from the Company, substantially all of the assets of the Company together with the goodwill of the Company (the ""Assets"").
B. Covenantor is a shareholder of the Company and has been employed as the Chief Executive Officer and the President of the Company.
C. Covenantor acknowledges that the Company and its employees and shareholders have over several years devoted substantial time, effort and resources to developing the Assets which consist of the Company's trade secrets and its other confidential and proprietary information as well as the Company's relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others doing business with the Company; that such relationships, trade secrets and other information are vital to the successful conduct of the Company's business by Buyer in the future; that because of Covenantor's access to such confidential information and trade secrets, Covenantor would be in a unique position to divert business from Buyer and to commit irreparable damage to Buyer were Covenantor to be allowed to compete with Buyer or to commit any of the other acts prohibited below; that the enforcement of said restrictive covenants against Covenantor would not impose any undue burden upon Covenantor; that none of said restrictive covenants is unreasonable as to period or geographic area; and that the ability to enforce said restrictive covenants against Covenantor is a material inducement to the decision of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth and the mutual benefits to be derived therefrom, Covenantor covenants and agrees as follows:
ARTICLE 1
DEFINITIONS
1.1 The term ""Buyer,"" as used herein, means not only Vertel Corporation, but also any company, partnership or entity which (a) directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Vertel Corporation or (b) is a successor-in-interest to Vertel Corporation.
1.2 The term ""Confidential Information"", as used herein, means all information or material not generally known by non-Company personnel constituting Assets and acquired by Buyer under the Purchase Agreement which (i) gives the Company some competitive business advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage or the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of the Company; (ii) which is owned by the Company or in which the Company has an interest and (iii) which is either (A) marked ""Confidential Information,"" ""Proprietary Information"" or other similar marking, (B) known by Covenantor to be considered confidential and proprietary by the Company as of the date hereof or (C) from all the relevant circumstances should reasonably be assumed by Covenantor to be confidential and proprietary to the Company. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the following types of information and other information of a similar nature (whether or not reduced to writing): trade secrets, inventions, drawings, file data, documentation, diagrams, specifications, know how, processes, formulas, models, flow charts, software in various stages of development, source code, object code, research and development procedures, research or development and test results, marketing techniques and materials, marketing and development plans, price lists, pricing policies, business plans, information relating to customers and/or suppliers' identities, characteristics and agreements, financial information and projections, and employee files. Confidential Information also includes any information described above which the Company obtains from another party and which the Company treats as proprietary or is required to treat as Confidential Information, whether or not owned or developed by the Company. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, HOWEVER, NO INFORMATION CONSTITUTES CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IF IT IS GENERIC INFORMATION OR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE WHICH COVENANTOR WOULD HAVE LEARNED IN
THE COURSE OF SIMILAR EMPLOYMENT ELSEWHERE IN THE TRADE, IF SUCH INFORMATION IS
LAWFULLY AVAILABLE TO COVENANTOR FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE COMPANY, OR IF IT
IS OTHERWISE PUBLICLY KNOWN AND IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
1.3 The term ""Closing"" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Purchase Agreement.
ARTICLE 2
COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE
Covenantor shall not at any time within the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the fourth (4/th/) anniversary of the date hereof (the ""Restricted Period""), have any
ownership interest (of record or beneficial) in or have any interest as an employee, salesman, consultant, officer or director in, or otherwise aid or assist in any manner, any firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship or other business that engages in any California county, or in any other state, country or geographic area, listed in Exhibit ""A"" hereof in a business that is similar to and directly or indirectly offers products or services in competition with the business in which the Company was engaged in such California county, state, country or other geographic area as of the Closing, so long as Buyer, or any successor in interest of Buyer to the business and goodwill of the Company, remains engaged in such business in any such California county, state, country or other geographic area or continues to solicit customers or potential customers therein; provided, however, that Covenantor may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, the securities of any person which are traded on any national securities exchange if Covenantor (i) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such person or (ii) does not, directly or indirectly own two percent (2%) or more of any class of securities of such person. For purposes of this ARTICLE 2, the business activities which may not be engaged in during the Restricted Period by Covenantor or by any firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship or other business in which Covenantor has any interest are more particularly described in Exhibit ""B"" hereof.
ARTICLE 3
SOLICITATION OF BUSINESS
During the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not solicit or assist any other person to solicit any business (other than for Buyer) from any present or past customer of the Company; or request or advise any present or future customer of the Company to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business dealings with Buyer; or commit any other act or assist others to commit any other act which might injure the business of Buyer.
ARTICLE 4
EMPLOYEES
During the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage any employee of Buyer to leave the employ of Buyer or (ii) hire any employee who has left the employ of Buyer if such hiring is proposed to occur within one year after the termination of such employee's employment with Buyer.
ARTICLE 5
CONSULTANTS
During the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any consultant then under contract with Buyer to cease work for Buyer.
ARTICLE 6
NONDISCLOSURE
From and after the Closing, Covenantor shall not (nor will Covenantor assist any other person to do so) directly or indirectly reveal, report, publish or disclose the Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation not expressly authorized by Buyer to receive such Confidential Information, or use (or assist any person to use) such Confidential Information except for the benefit of Buyer.
ARTICLE 7
OWNERSHIP AND RETURN OF MATERIALS
Upon the termination of Covenantor's employment with Buyer, Covenantor shall immediately surrender to Buyer all notes, data, sketches, drawings, manuals, documents, records, data bases, programs, blueprints, memoranda, specifications, customer lists, financial reports, equipment and all other physical forms of expression incorporating or containing any Confidential Information, it being distinctly understood that all such writings, physical forms of expression and other things are the exclusive property of Buyer. Covenantor acknowledges that the unauthorized taking of any of Buyer's trade secrets is a crime under California Penal Code section 499(c) and is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or in a county jail for a time not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both such fine and such imprisonment. Covenantor further acknowledges that such unauthorized taking of Buyer's trade secrets could also result in civil liability under California Civil Code Section 3426, and that willful misappropriation may result in an award against Covenantor for triple the amount of Buyer's damages and Buyer's attorneys fees in collecting such damages.
ARTICLE 8
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH
If Covenantor breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this Agreement (the ""Restrictive Covenants""), Buyer shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Buyer under law or in equity:
8.1 Specific Performance. The right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced or to have any actual or threatened breach thereof enjoined by any court having equity jurisdiction, all without the need to post a bond or any other security or to prove any amount of actual damage or that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer; and
8.2 Accounting and Indemnification. The right and remedy to require Covenantor (i) to account for and pay over to Buyer all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Covenantor or any associated party deriving such benefits as a result of any such breach of the Restrictive Covenants; and (ii) to indemnify Buyer against any other losses, damages (including special and consequential damages), costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, which may be incurred by them and which result from or arise out of any such breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants.
ARTICLE 9
SEVERABILITY OF COVENANTS/BLUE PENCILLING
The Restrictive Covenants shall be subject to Section 12.7 hereof and Covenantor hereby waives any and all right to attack the validity of the Restrictive Covenants on the grounds of the breadth of their geographic scope or the length of their term.
ARTICLE 10
ENFORCEABILITY IN JURISDICTIONS
Buyer and Covenantor intend to and do hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants.

OBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVING PARTY. The receiving party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written approval of the disclosing party.

Any copies which are made shall be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and marked ""confidential,"" ""proprietary,"" or with a similar legend.

TERMINATION OF OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY. The receiving party shall not be liable for the disclosure of any Confidential Information which is:
(a) in the public domain other than by a breach of this Agreement on the part of the receiving party; or
(b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or
(c) rightfully known to the receiving party without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the disclosing party; or
(d) independently developed by employees of the receiving party; or (e) generally made available to third parties by the disclosing party

GENERAL.
(a) This Agreement is neither intended to nor shall it be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership or other form of business association between the parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell products using or incorporating the Confidential Information, nor as creating an implied or express license grant from either party to the other.
(b) The failure of either party to enforce any right resulting from breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party shall not be deemed a waiver of any right relating to a subsequent breach of such provision or of any other right hereunder.
(c) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.
(d) This Agreement, any accompanying CITR and CITRs executed from time to time hereafter which incorporate the terms of this Agreement constitute the entire agreement, written or verbal, between the parties with respect to the disclosure(s) of Confidential Information described in each CITR.

"AGREEMENT DATE: JUNE 2, 1999 EXHIBIT 1
Corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement
This Corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement (""Agreement"") is entered into and made effective as of the date set forth above, by and between Intel Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries (""Intel""), and the Participant identified below (""Participant""). Unless the Participant indicates that this Agreement will apply only to the specific division or location, this Agreement will apply to the Participant's entire Company.
THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
1. Confidential Information Transmittal Form. The confidential, proprietary and made secret information of the disclosing party (""Confidential Information"") to be disclosed hereunder is that information which (i) is described in the Confidential Information Transmittal Record (""CITR"") executed from time to time hereafter and (ii) is marked with a ""confidential"", ""proprietary"", or similar legend.
CITRs are subject to the terms of this Agreement. CITRs will be executed, in writing or in electronic form, by the parties prior to the disclosure of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information received from the disclosing party will be in tangible form. To be considered Confidential Information, non-tangible disclosures must be identified as confidential prior to disclosure and produced in writing, marked as provided above and delivered to the receiving party within thirty (30) days of the original date of disclosure. The CITR will indicate the disclosing party, a description of the Confidential Information disclosed, the names of the representatives of the parties and the dates when the disclosure covered by the CITR commenced.
2. Obligations of Receiving Party. The receiving party will maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party with at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. The receiving party will not disclose any of the disclosing party's Confidential Information to any employees or to any third parties except to the receiving party's employees, parent company and majority-owned subsidiaries who have a need to know and who agree to abide by nondisclosure terms at least as comprehensive as those set forth herein: provided that the receiving party will be liable for breach by any such entity. The receiving party will not make any copies of the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party except as necessary for its employees, parent company and majority-owned subsidiaries with a need to know. Any copies which are made will be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and marked ""confidential"", ""proprietary"", or with a similar legend.
3. Period of Non-Assertion. Unless a shorter period is indicated in the applicable CITR, the disclosing party will not insert any claims of breach of this Agreement or misappropriation of trade secrets against the receiving party arising from the receiving party's disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information made more than five (5) years from the date of the CITR under which such information was disclosed. However, unless at least one of the exceptions set for in Section 4 below has occurred, the receiving party will continue to treat such confidential Information as the confidential information of the disclosing party and only disclose any such Confidential Information to third parties under the terms of a non-disclosure agreement.
4. Termination of Obligation of Confidentiality. The receiving party will not be liable for the disclosure of any Confidential Information which is:
(a) rightfully in public domain other than by a breach of duty to the disclosing party
(b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality
(c) rightfully known to the receiving party without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the disclosing party
(d) independently developed by employees of the receiving party; or
(e) generally made available to third parties by the disclosing party without restriction on disclosure.
5. Title. Title or the right to possess Confidential Information as between the parties will remain in the disclosing party.

"NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this ""Agreement"") is made and entered into as of the 31st day of July, 1997, by and between Roland W. Samples (""Samples""), Wyndham Hotel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the ""Acquiror""), and ClubHouse Hotels, Inc., a Kansas corporation (the ""Target Company"").
RECITALS
A. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July, 21 1997 among the Target Company, the Acquiror, WHC Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (""MergerSub""), Samples and David H. Aull (the ""Merger Agreement""), the parties have agreed to the merger of MergerSub with and into the Target Company (the ""Merger"") and certain related transactions (the Merger and such related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the ""Merger Transactions""), all on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and such other ancillary agreements as are referenced therein.
B. Samples is a principal stockholder of the Target Company and, as such, will derive substantial benefit from the Merger Transactions.
C. Each of the Acquiror and the Target Company has been and presently is engaged (itself and through its subsidiaries and the Related Entities) in the business of owning, franchising, licensing and operating hotels (the ""Business""). Samples is a director and the President and Chief Financial Officer of the Target Company (and is also an officer and/or director of certain of the Target Company's subsidiaries and affiliates and the Related Entities).
D. The Merger Agreement provides, as a condition to the Closing thereunder, that Samples shall execute and deliver this Agreement.
E. The agreements of Samples hereunder are an important aspect of the Merger Transactions, and the Acquiror and MergerSub would not consummate the Merger Transactions absent the execution and delivery by Samples of this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual promises contained herein, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties do hereby agree as follows:
1. Certain Definitions. Terms with initial capital letters used herein that are not defined herein shall have the meanings provided for such terms in the Merger Agreement. As used herein, the term ""Target Company"" shall mean ClubHouse Hotels, Inc. prior to the consummation of the Merger and as the surviving corporation in the Merger.
2. Restrictive Covenants.
(a) Samples hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property rights, marketing and operating techniques, contacts, customers, suppliers, technology and other aspects of the business of the Target Company and the Related Entities have been, and hereafter will be, of value to the Acquiror, the Target Company and the Related Entities and have provided, and hereafter will provide, the Acquiror, the Target Company and the Related Entities with substantial competitive advantage in the operation of their businesses; (ii) by virtue of his previous relationship with the Target Company and the Related Entities as an officer, director, shareholder and employee, he has detailed and substantial knowledge and possesses confidential information concerning the business, operations, pricing structure, customers, suppliers, personnel and competitive methods of the Target Company and the Related Entities; and (iii) he has substantial financial resources and experience in the business of owning, franchising, licensing and operating hotels and the ability to operate a business or businesses that could compete with the Acquiror, the Target Company, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates and the other Related Entities.
(b) Samples agrees that, except for such disclosure as may be required by applicable law, he shall not, directly or indirectly, for himself or through or on behalf of any other person or entity, at any time after the date hereof, without the prior written consent of the Acquiror, reveal, divulge, disclose or communicate to any person, firm, association, corporation or other entity, or use, in any manner whatsoever any know-how, trade secrets, intellectual property rights, marketing and operating techniques, business contacts, client or customer lists, suppliers, technology, contracts or other confidential or proprietary information of the Target Company, any Related Entity or any of their respective affiliates (except Innco Hospitality, Inc. and any entity controlled by Innco Hospitality, Inc. and Transamerican Properties, Inc. and T.I.P. Realty Partners, and any entity controlled by either of them and the Broadway Plaza Suites in Kansas City, Missouri); provided, however, that for purposes hereof, information shall not be considered to be confidential or proprietary if (i) it is a matter of common knowledge or public record or (ii) the Undersigned can demonstrate that such information was already known to the recipient thereof other than by reason of any breach of any obligation under this Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement.
(c) Samples agrees that, for a period of five (5) years (or such lesser period hereinafter provided for) following the date hereof (the ""Restricted Period""), he shall not, without the prior express written consent of the Acquiror:
(i) except with respect to the Permitted Hotels (as defined below), call upon, solicit, divert, take away or attempt to call upon, solicit, divert or take away any existing or potential customers, suppliers or accounts of the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or the Related Entities or their respective businesses in connection with any business substantially similar to the Business;
(ii) hire or attempt to hire, for himself or on behalf of any other person, any present or future employee of the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or any Related Entity; or
(iii) own, lease, maintain, operate, franchise, license, manage, invest in or provide financing for, or give any advice to any person, firm, partnership, association, venture, corporation or other entity owning an interest in or engaging, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of, (A) any Hilton Garden, Courtyard by Marriott or Doubletree Club hotel wherever located or (B) any other Upscale Hotel (as defined below) or Extended Stay Hotel (as defined below) located in the United States, Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean within a ten (10)-mile radius of any hotel now or hereafter operated under the ""Wyndham,"" ""ClubHouse,"" or ""Homegate"" brand, except for any such activity conducted for or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any of the Acquiror Companies or, in the case of clause (B), Permitted Hotels (as defined below); provided, that if a hotel operated under the ""Wyndham,"" ""ClubHouse,"" or ""Homegate"" brand is announced for a location that is within a ten (10)-mile radius of any hotel that prior to the date of such announcement was in operation and is owned, managed or operated by any such entity in which Samples has also prior to such date commenced involvement of a type that would otherwise be restricted by clause (B), then this clause (iii) shall not require Samples to cease such involvement; or
(iv) enter into any contract or make any commitment to take any action that is restricted by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above.
(d) As used in the foregoing provisions, (i) the term ""Upscale Hotel"" shall mean any hotel or other lodging facility that is a full service hotel or facility of a type that is treated or classified as an ""upscale hotel"" or as part of the ""upscale segment"" of the lodging industry by Smith Travel Research or, if such a classification is not available from Smith Travel Research, by a similar reputable hotel industry service; (ii) the term ""Extended Stay Hotel"" shall mean any hotel or other lodging facility that derives the majority of its business from guests who stay three consecutive nights or longer or that is of a type that is treated or classified as an ""extended stay hotel"" or as part of the ""extended stay segment"" of the lodging industry by Smith Travel Research or, if such a classification is not available from Smith Travel Research, by a similar reputable hotel industry service and (iii) ""Permitted Hotels"" shall mean, collectively, (A) the hotel in Wichita, Kansas operated as of the date hereof as the Wichita Airport Hilton and (B) the hotel in Peoria, Illinois operated as of the date hereof as the Pere Marquette, (C) any upscale all-suites hotel located or to be located adjacent to the Sprint campus in Overland Park, Kansas, (D) the Holiday Inn in Topeka, Kansas, so long as managed under a management contract by Samples or any entity controlled by Samples; (E) if so provided by Section 2(e) below, any three (3) other hotels that, at the time that Samples owns, leases, operates, franchises, licenses, manages, invests in or gives advice in respect of such hotels, have been open and in operation for at least one (1) years, provided that this clause (E) and the similar provision of the Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement of David H. Aull of even date herewith shall collectively not authorize more than a total of three hotels; (F) the Broadway Plaza Suites in Kansas City, Missouri and (G) any Extended Stay Hotel at a specified site if (x) Samples has offered in writing to Acquiror or its designee to develop for Acquiror or such designee an Extended Stay Hotel at such site as a Homegate brand (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates) Extended Stay Hotel in accordance with the procedure set forth below and (y) Acquiror or its designee has either advised Samples that it does not wish to have an Extended Stay Hotel developed at such site as a Homegate (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates) or failed to respond within the time period set forth below. In the case of clause (G) above, Samples' offer shall include a reasonably detailed proposal for the development of the site as an Extended Stay Hotel. Acquiror or its designee shall be given at least thirty (30) days to evaluate such offer and respond to Samples. If Acquiror or its designee fails to respond within such thirty (30) day period or advises Samples that it does not wish to have an Extended Stay Hotel developed at such site as a Homegate (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates), Samples may develop an Extended Stay Hotel on such site with another party if construction of such Extended Stay Hotel is commenced within 180 days thereafter and is pursued with reasonable diligence thereafter.
(e) If, by July 1, 1998, Samples has not entered into an agreement with the Acquiror (or any successor to or affiliate of the Acquiror or any such successor) concerning the development, franchise or operation of a hotel, then upon such date the definition of Permitted Hotels in Section 2(d) above shall include clause (E) thereof from and after such date. As used in the preceding sentence and in Section 2(f) below, an ""affiliate"" of any person means any other person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such first person.
(f) If, by July 1, 1998 (if the merger of Acquiror into Patriot Hospitality, Inc. provided for in the Patriot-Acquiror Merger Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the""Patriot-Acquiror Merger"") has not occurred by that date) or one (1) year after the closing of the Patriot-Acquiror Merger (if such merger has occurred prior to July 1, 1998), Samples has not entered into an agreement with the Acquiror (or any successor to or affiliate of the Acquiror or any such successor) concerning the development, franchise or operation of a hotel, then upon such date the term of the Restricted Period automatically shall be reduced from five (5) to three (3) years.
(g) Except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, the covenants in this Section 2 are intended to restrict Samples from competing in any manner with the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities or the Business in the activities that have heretofore been carried on by the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities. The obligations set forth in this Section above shall apply to actions by Samples, whether taken directly or indirectly, through any form of ownership, and whether as principal, officer, director, agent, employee, employer, consultant, stockholder or holder of any equity security (beneficially or as trustee of any trust), lender, partner, joint venturer or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever. However, none of the foregoing shall prevent Samples from (i) being the holder of up to 5% in the aggregate of any class of securities of any corporation engaged in the activities described above, provided that such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or reported on NASDAQ or (ii) being the holder of non-convertible debt securities of any entity.
3. Enforcement of Covenants. Samples acknowledges that a violation or attempted violation of any of the covenants and agreements in Section 2 above will cause such damage to the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, Samples agrees that each of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and any Related Entity shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining such violation or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements by Samples, or the employees, partners or agents of Samples, as well as recover from Samples any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. Samples agrees that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction. Samples further agrees that the Restricted Period shall be tolled during any period of violation thereof by Samples. Any exercise by any one or more of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities of their respective rights pursuant to this Section 3 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies to each of them may be entitled.
4. Intellectual Property. Samples recognizes and agrees that, on and after the date hereof, he will not have the right to use for his own account any of the service marks, trademarks, trade names, licenses, labels, trade secrets or customers' lists owned by or licensed to the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or any of the Related Entities.
5. Consideration. As consideration for Samples' agreements provided herein, the Acquiror agrees to pay to Samples the total sum of $500,000, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the date hereof. Samples also acknowledges and agrees that, in addition thereto, he has received substantial consideration and benefit, direct and indirect, pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
6. Validity. Samples acknowledges and agrees that each of the covenants contained herein is a reasonable limitation as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained and does not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other interests of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if it should ever be held that any provision contained herein does not contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area or scope of activity to be restrained, then the court so holding shall at the request of any of the Acquiror Companies or the Target Company or any Related Entity reform such provisions to the extent necessary to cause them to contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained and to give the maximum permissible effect to the intentions of the parties as set forth herein; and the court shall enforce such provisions as so reformed. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision hereof is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws effective during the term hereof, such provision shall be fully severable; this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or enforceable provision or by its severance here from. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically by the Acquiror and the Target Company as a part hereof a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable, and the parties hereby agree to such provision.
7. Waiver of Breach. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by any party.
8. Tax Reporting. The parties hereby expressly agree that the consideration given and received pursuant to this Agreement shall, for income tax purposes, be reported as amounts paid for a covenant not to compete. The parties acknowledge that Samples shall be solely responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes arising from his receipt of the consideration under this Agreement.

Any notice, request, instruction, document or other communication to be given hereunder by any party hereto to any other party hereto shall be in writing and validly given if (i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by telecopy, (iii) delivered by overnight express, or (iv) sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, as follows:

THIS AGREEMENT governs the disclosure of information by and between Oacis Healthcare Systems Corp. (""OACIS"") and Science Applications International Corporation (""SAIC"") as of November 4th, 1998 (the ""EFFECTIVE DATE"").
1. As used herein, ""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information provided by either party to the other, including but not limited to (a) patent and patent applications, (b) trade secret, and (c) proprietary information, ideas, techniques, sketches, drawings, works of authorship, models, inventions, know-how, processes, apparatuses, equipment, algorithms, software programs, software source documents, and formulae related to the current, future, and proposed products and services of each of the parties, and including, without limitation, their respective information concerning research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications, engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, customer lists, investors, employees, business and contractual relationships, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, marketing plans and information the disclosing party provides regarding third parties.
2. Each party agrees that at all times until termination or expiration of this Agreement it will hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any third party Confidential Information of the other, except as approved in writing by the other party to this Agreement, and will use the Confidential Information for no purpose other than evaluating or pursuing a business relationship with the other party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the party to whom Confidential Information was disclosed (the ""RECIPIENT"") shall not be in violation of this Section 3 with regard to a disclosure that was in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, provided that the Recipient provides the other party with prior written notice of such disclosure in order to permit the other party to seek confidential treatment of such information. Each party shall only permit access to Confidential Information of the other party to those of its employees or authorized representatives having a need to know and who have signed confidentiality agreements or are otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein.
3. Each party shall immediately notify the other upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other party.
4. Each party's obligations under this Agreement with respect to any portion of the other party's Confidential Information shall terminate when the Recipient can document that: (a) it was in the public domain at the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party; (b) it entered the public domain subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party through no fault of the Recipient; (c) it was in the Recipient's possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party; (d) it was rightfully communicated to the Recipient free of any obligation of confidence subsequent to the time it was communicated to the Recipient by the other party or (e) it was communicated by the other party to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence.
5. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, or upon written request of the other party, each party shall promptly destroy or return to the other all documents and other tangible materials representing the other's Confidential Information and all copies thereof. The Recipient agrees to destroy all documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the Recipient or its employees or representatives based on the information contained in the Confidential Information (except for references or summaries appearing in minutes or corporate records).
6. In addition, each party agrees that it will not (and direct its employees and representatives not to) disclose (i) to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning one or more possible transactions between the parties or (ii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transactions, including the status thereof.
7. Although the disclosing party has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information, information known to it which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of the Recipient's investigation of a potential transaction, the Recipient acknowledges and agrees that neither the disclosing party nor any of its employees or representatives have made or make any representations or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of all or any portion of the Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees that neither the disclosing party nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or any of the Recipient's employees or representatives resulting from the use of, or conclusions arising from, the Confidential Information.
8. The parties recognize and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any property rights, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right that has issued or that may issue, based on such Confidential Information. Neither party shall make, have made, use or sell for any purpose any product or other item using, incorporating or derived from any Confidential Information to the other party.
9. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of the other party by either party shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the other party.
10. Nothing contained herein shall imply any obligations of either party to proceed with a transaction between the parties, and each party reserves the right to terminate the discussions contemplated hereunder, with or without cause, without any liability for such termination.
11. This Agreement shall terminate three (3) years after the Effective Date and shall be binding upon the Recipient's heirs, successors and assigns.
12. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California without reference to conflict of laws principles. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.
13. Each party acknowledges that its breach of the Agreement will cause irreparable damage and hereby agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief under this Agreement, as well as such further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, in the event of a breach by the Recipient, the disclosing party shall be entitled to recover the costs of enforcing this Agreement including, without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees.
14. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and in such event, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
15. Neither party shall communicate any information to the other in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party.
16. Neither party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party.
17. Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing any
such data to any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval.
18. All notices or reports permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, facsimile transmission or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed given upon personal delivery, five (5) days after deposit in the mail, or upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission. Notices shall be sent to the addresses set forth at the end of this Agreement or such other address as either party may specify in writing.
19. Each of the parties agrees that the software programs of the other party contain valuable confidential information and each party agrees it will not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the Confidential Information of the other party without the prior written consent of the other party.
20. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, and such counterparts together shall constitute only one instrument.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement to be executed as of the Effective Date.

Pursuant to the Agreement to which this Exhibit B is annexed, Company may be disclosing to Independent Contractor certain confidential business plans, development plans, reports, financial information, design documents, specifications, programmer notes, software (its own and/or third party), and/or other information, whether or not so identified (together with any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, or other documents that are based upon, contain, or otherwise reflect such information, the ""Confidential Information,"" which shall include this Agreement). The parties agree as follows with respect to treatment of the Confidential Information:
1. Independent Contractor shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing the Services specified in the applicable SOW and not for any other purpose. Except to the extent permitted by Section 3 below, Independent Contractor will not disclose the Confidential Information, in whole or in part, to any other party. In fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, Independent Contractor shall use at least the same standard of care it uses to protect its own information of similar kind, but not less than a reasonable standard of care.
2. The term ""Confidential Information"" shall be deemed not to include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than (a) as a result of a disclosure by Independent Contractor or any other person who directly or indirectly receives such information from the Independent Contractor or (b) in violation of a confidentiality obligation to the Company known to Independent Contractor or (ii) is or becomes available to Independent Contractor on a non-confidential basis from a source which is entitled to disclose it to Independent Contractor or (iii) is independently developed by Independent Contractor without benefit of the Confidential Information.
3. In the event that Independent Contractor is required by law or by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, Civil Investigative Demand, or similar process to disclose any information supplied to Independent Contractor pursuant to the Agreement, including without limitation the Confidential Information or any other information the disclosure of which is restricted by the terms of this Exhibit B, Independent Contractor will provide the Company with prompt prior written notice of such request or requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in the absence of a protective order, Independent Contractor is nonetheless, in the written opinion of its counsel (which shall be forwarded to the Company upon request), compelled to disclose Confidential Information or any other information the disclosure of which is restricted by the terms of this Exhibit B to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other material censure or penalty, Independent Contractor may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information or other information which it is advised in writing by its counsel (which shall be forwarded to the Company upon request) is so legally compelled and Independent Contractor will exercise its best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information.
4. All Confidential Information disclosed by the Company to Independent Contractor shall be and shall remain the Company's property. Upon termination of the Agreement, Independent Contractor shall redeliver all tangible Confidential Information furnished by the Company. Except to the extent Independent Contractor is advised in writing by counsel that such action is prohibited by law, Independent Contractor will also destroy all written material, memoranda, notes, and other writings or recordings whatsoever prepared by it based upon, containing, or otherwise reflecting any Confidential Information. Any Confidential Information that is not returned or destroyed, including without limitation any oral Confidential Information, shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Exhibit B.
5. Independent Contractor acknowledges and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Exhibit B by Independent Contractor and that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance, including without limitation injunctive relief, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Exhibit B but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. Independent Contractor agrees to reimburse the Company for costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company in connection with the enforcement of this Exhibit B.
6. If any provision of this Exhibit B is not enforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Exhibit B shall not be affected thereby. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege hereunder.","nondisclosure, requirement, pursuant, agreement, exhibit, b, annexed, company, may, disclosing, independent, contractor, certain, confidential, business, plan, development, plan, report, financial, information, design, document, specification, programmer, note, software, andor, third, party, andor, information, whether, identified, together, note, analysis, compilation, study, document, based, upon, contain, otherwise, reflect, information, confidential, information, shall, include, agreement, party, agree, follows, respect, treatment, confidential, information, 1, independent, contractor, shall, use, confidential, information, solely, purpose, performing, service, specified, applicable, sow, purpose, except, extent, permitted, section, 3, independent, contractor, disclose, confidential, information, whole, part, party, fulfilling, obligation, agreement, independent, contractor, shall, use, least, standard, care, us, protect, information, similar, kind, le, reasonable, standard, care, 2, term, confidential, information, shall, deemed, include, information, becomes, generally, available, public, result, disclosure, independent, contractor, person, directly, indirectly, receives, information, independent, contractor, b, violation, confidentiality, obligation, company, known, independent, contractor, ii, becomes, available, independent, contractor, nonconfidential, basis, source, entitled, disclose, independent, contractor, iii, independently, developed, independent, contractor, without, benefit, confidential, information, 3, event, independent, contractor, required, law, interrogatory, request, information, document, subpoena, civil, investigative, demand, similar, process, disclose, information, supplied, independent, contractor, pursuant, agreement, including, without, limitation, confidential, information, information, disclosure, restricted, term, exhibit, b, independent, contractor, provide, company, prompt, prior, written, notice, request, requirement, company, may, seek, appropriate, protective, order, absence, protective, order, independent, contractor, nonetheless, written, opinion, counsel, shall, forwarded, company, upon, request, compelled, disclose, confidential, information, information, disclosure, restricted, term, exhibit, b, tribunal, else, stand, liable, contempt, suffer, material, censure, penalty, independent, contractor, may, disclose, portion, confidential, information, information, advised, writing, counsel, shall, forwarded, company, upon, request, legally, compelled, independent, contractor, exercise, best, effort, obtain, assurance, confidential, treatment, accorded, confidential, information, 4, confidential, information, disclosed, company, independent, contractor, shall, shall, remain, company, property, upon, termination, agreement, independent, contractor, shall, redeliver, tangible, confidential, information, furnished, company, except, extent, independent, contractor, advised, writing, counsel, action, prohibited, law, independent, contractor, also, destroy, written, material, memoranda, note, writing, recording, whatsoever, prepared, based, upon, containing, otherwise, reflecting, confidential, information, confidential, information, returned, destroyed, including, without, limitation, oral, confidential, information, shall, remain, subject, confidentiality, obligation, set, forth, exhibit, b, 5, independent, contractor, acknowledges, agrees, money, damage, would, sufficient, remedy, breach, exhibit, b, independent, contractor, company, shall, entitled, specific, performance, including, without, limitation, injunctive, relief, remedy, breach, remedy, shall, deemed, exclusive, remedy, breach, exhibit, b, shall, addition, remedy, available, law, equity, independent, contractor, agrees, reimburse, company, cost, expense, including, without, limitation, attorney, fee, incurred, company, connection, enforcement, exhibit, b, 6, provision, exhibit, b, enforceable, whole, part, remaining, provision, exhibit, b, shall, affected, thereby, failure, delay, exercising, right, power, privilege, hereunder, shall, operate, waiver, thereof, shall, single, partial, exercise, thereof, preclude, exercise, thereof, exercise, right, power, privilege, hereunder"

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
The Parties acknowledge that each owns certain CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, as defined herein, which might relate to the inventions, conceptions, ideas, know-how, discoveries, processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, formulations, processes, biological material, biological methods, or any improvements thereof, whether or not patentable or suitable for other form of exclusive right or legal protection, conceived, made or derived during the course of Work within the Project under this JRA; and
The Parties are willing to disclose to each other such necessary CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION provided each Party preserves the confidential nature of the other Party's INFORMATION and uses it solely for purposes of this Agreement.
The Parties agree as follows:
1. ""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"" as used in this Agreement means all technical or business information disclosed by one of the Parties to another pursuant to the JRA that is identified at the time of disclosure or within thirty (30) days thereafter as being confidential and proprietary. No information will be regarded as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION if the Party to which it is disclosed can show by competent proof that such information
(a) was at the time of disclosure, or subsequently became, through no fault of the receiving Party, known to the general public through publication or otherwise; or
(b) was, subsequent to disclosure to a Party, lawfully and independently received by that Party from a third party who had the right to disclose it without restriction.
Specific aspects or details of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not be deemed to be within the public domain or in the possession of a Party merely because the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION is embraced by general disclosures in the public domain or in the possession of a Party. In addition, any combination of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of a Party merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain or in the possession of that Party unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the possession of that Party.
2. Any Party, at its discretion, may disclose to another Party any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION that the disclosing Party, in its reasonable judgment, believes is sufficient to enable the receiving Party to arrive at conceptions, ideas, innovations, discoveries, inventions, compositions, biological material, biological methods, whether or not patentable or susceptible to any other form of legal protection, during performance Under the IRA. Any Party may also cause such disclosures to be made to the other Party on behalf of the disclosing Party by third parties who are Under obligations of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; such disclosures from third parties shall be deemed to be disclosures by the disclosing Party.
3. In consideration of each and every disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, the Parties agree to:
(a) treat as confidential and to preserve the confidentiality of all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION;
(b) use any and all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION solely in connection with the performance of the IRA and for no other purpose; (c) make no disclosures of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any party other than officers and employees of a Party to this IRA;
(d) limit access to CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to those officers and employees having a reasonable need for such INFORMATION and being boUnd by a written obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such INFORMATION; and
(e) maintain in confidence any information regarding the nature or scope of any transaction between the Parties, except to the extent such information must be disclosed pursuant to law, and then only after notifying the other Party of such requirement.
Any obligation imposed by this paragraph 3 may be waived in writing by a Party as to particular CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and to a particular use or disclosure. Any such waiver will have a one-time effect and will not apply to any subsequent situation regardless of its similarity.
4. All CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION will remain the property of the disclosing Party and, upon request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, or any part or reproduction thereof.
5. The obligations of each and every Party, and each employee and officer of each Party Under this Agreement will expire five (5) years from the termination of the JRA.
6. This Agreement is subject to the laws (excluding conflicts rules) of the State of New York.
7. The terms and provisions of this Agreement will inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and assigns and will be binding on said successors and assigns. This paragraph notwithstanding, neither Party may disclose any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any successor or assign absent prior written consent of the disclosing Party.
8. The Parties understand and agree that no right or license under any patent, patent application, or know-how is granted to any other Party or any other person by this Agreement or by any disclosure of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement on the date first written above.

"AMENDED AND RESTATED
MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Amended and Restated Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (""Agreement"") is entered into as of March 1, 1998 between TWENTIETH CENTRUTY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC. (""Company"") (collectively, ""Parties""). This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement previously entered into by the Parties. The Parties will provide each other with Confidential Information as defined below in connection with one or more possible or actual transactions between the Parties (each a ""Transaction""). As a condition of one of the Parties or its agents or its representatives furnishing Confidential Information (""Furnishing Party"") to the other of the Parties or its agents or its representatives receiving Confidential Information (""Receiving Party""), the Receiving Party shall treat the Confidential Information confidentially as set forth below.
1. ""Confidential Information"" shall mean all non-public proprietary information provided by the Furnishing Party to the Receiving Party, whether or not marked or otherwise specifically designated as confidential. The term ""Confidential Information"" does not include information which (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party, (ii) was available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior the Furnishing Party's disclosure to the Receiving Party, or (iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party, provided that such source is, to the best of the Receiving Party's knowledge, not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Furnishing Party or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Furnishing Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation.
2. It is understood that the Receiving Party may disclose any of the Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's (and its subsidiaries' and affiliates') directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys and financial advisors), and prospective bank or institutional lenders, (collectively, ""Representatives"") who require such material in connection with a possible or actual Transaction (provided that such Representatives shall be informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to act in accordance with the terms hereof). The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information of the Furnishing Party will be kept confidential by the Receiving Party and its Representatives and, except with the specific prior written consent of the Furnishing Party, or as expressly otherwise permitted by the terms hereof, will not be disclosed by the Receiving Party or its Representatives. The Parties further agree that the Receiving Party and its Representatives will not use any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose other than in connection with a possible or actual Transaction.
3. Company acknowledges and agrees that certain Confidential Information is extremely competitively sensitive for Fox (""Highly Confidential Information"") and shall therefore be subject to restrictions on disclosure additional to those applicable to other Confidential Information. Highly Confidential Information shall include the identity of Fox's actual and potential customers and vendors; Fox's release schedules and sales trends; the prices and pricing policies of Fox, its vendors and customers; all customer shipment, point-of-sale and returns information; Fox's strategic planning information regarding system implementation (including geographic implementation) and process improvement; all distribution software used by and software development performed for Fox; Fox's replenishment schedules and processes, inventory management schedules and processes; and any other competitively sensitive Confidential Information designated by Fox from time to time as ""Highly Confidential Information"". Company shall limit disclosure of Highly Confidential Information to Company employees. Company shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such employee. Company shall not disclose Highly Confidential Information to any of its consultants, or other vendors, or agents.
4. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested or required by applicable Federal or State law of the United States to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Receiving Party or its Representative, as the case may be, will provide the Furnishing Party with prompt notice of such request(s) so that it may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance by the Receiving Party or its Representative with the provisions of the Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Furnishing Party grants a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party or such Representative of the Receiving Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which it is legally compelled to disclose and will exercise its best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information so furnished.
5. Without the prior written consent of Company, (i) neither Fox nor those of its Representatives who are aware of the Confidential Information of Company will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of Company concerning the Confidential Information, and (ii) none of Fox's directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information will, for the two-year period from the date of the Agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any employee of Company who is aware of the Confidential Information of Company.
6. Without the prior written consent of Fox, (i) neither Company nor those of its Representatives who are aware of the Confidential Information of Fox will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of Fox concerning the Confidential Information, and (ii) none of Company's directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information will, for the two-year period from the date of the Agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any employee of Fox who is aware of the Confidential Information of Fox.
7. Upon providing the Receiving Party with a specific list of the Confidential Information to be returned to the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly deliver to the Furnishing Party or its Representatives, the Confidential Information listed, together with all copies thereof, in the possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives, which was actually furnished by the Furnishing Party to the Receiving Party.
8. Although the Receiving Party understands that the Furnishing Party has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information information known to it which it believes to be relevant to a possible or actual Transaction, the Receiving Party further understands that neither the Furnishing Party nor its Representatives make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Furnishing Party nor its Representatives shall have any liability to Receiving Party or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by the Receiving Party or its Representatives.
9. The provisions set forth in this Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing signed by the Parties expressly so modifying or waiving such provisions.
10. The Receiving Party hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Furnishing Party from any damage, loss, cost or liability (including legal fees and the cost of enforcing this indemnity) arising out of, or resulting from, any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party also acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives and that any such breach would cause the Furnishing Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Receiving Party also
agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Furnishing Party, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.
11. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
12. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the rights and benefits thereof shall be assigned by the party to any purchaser of a controlling share of equity in that party.
13. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
14. The Parties hereby represent and warrant that the undersigned officer is authorized to execute this Agreement on its behalf.
By signing in the spaces provided below, Fox and Company have agreed to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

This Agreement made this 22 of March 2005, by and between Symmetrex Inc. (""Symmetrex"") with an address of 850 Trafalgar Court, Suite 110, Maitland FL, 32751 and MORGAN BEAUMONT INC. with an address at 6015 31st Street East, Bradenton, FL 34203 (""Other Party"").
WHEREAS, SYMMETREX and Other Party (jointly the ""parties"") wish to disclose to each other certain information solely for the purpose of evaluating a proposed business arrangement between the parties (the ""Evaluation""); and
WHEREAS, in consideration of and as an inducement for and condition of such disclosure, each party hereby requires the other party to agree to the terms and conditions of this agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, for adequate consideration acknowledged to be received by each party, each party, intending to be legally bound, hereby agrees as follows:
1. For all purposes of this agreement, the following definitions shall apply:
A. ""Confidential Information"" of a party shall mean any trade secrets, know-how, inventions, products, designs, methods, techniques, systems, processes, software programs, works of authorship, business plans, customer lists, projects, plans, pricing, proposals and any other information which a party discloses to the Recipient Party that: (i) if disclosed in writing is clearly marked as confidential or carries a similar legend; or (ii) if disclosed verbally or in tangible form is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, then summarized in a writing so marked by the Disclosing Party and delivered to the Recipient Party with fifteen (15) days. Confidential Information shall also include the terms of this agreement, the fact that the information is being made available to the parties hereunder and the fact that the parties are contemplating a possible business arrangement.
B. ""Disclosing Party"" shall mean, with respect to any information disclosed by one party to the other, the party which, directly or through one of its agents, discloses such information.
C. ""Recipient Party"" shall mean, with respect to any information disclosed by one party to the other, the party which receives such information.
2. Each Recipient Party with respect to Confidential Information received by it hereunder shall:
A. Hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and protect it in accordance with a standard of care which shall be no less than the care it uses to protect its own information of like importance and in no event less than reasonable care.
B. Not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as is necessary for the Evaluation referenced above or as otherwise authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party of such information in advance.
C. Not disclose Confidential Information to any person other than to one of the Recipient Party's directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants or agents (collectively called ""Representatives"") who need to know such information for the purposes of the Evaluation, provided that each Representative shall be informed, directed and obligated by the Recipient Party to treat such information in accordance with the obligations of this agreement and the Recipient Party shall be liable for breach of any such obligation by any of its Representatives.
D. Not copy or otherwise duplicate such Confidential Information, or knowingly allow anyone else to copy or otherwise duplicate any such Confidential Information without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval.
3. Each Recipient Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in the event that any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party is required to be disclosed by the Recipient Party by judicial, administrative or other govern mental order. Such notification shall be made reasonably promptly so that the Disclosing Party, at its expense, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Provided such notification is given, the Recipient Party is hereby authorized to comply with such judicial, administrative or governmental order. The Recipient Party shall provide the Disclosing Party reasonable cooperation (at the expense of the Disclosing Party) in connection with any protective order or other remedy sought by the Disclosing Party in connection with such order.
4. The obligations imposed on a Recipient Party with respect to Confidential Information shall not apply to Confidential Information disclosed to it hereunder which (a) the Recipient Party can demonstrate is, at the time of disclosure, already known to the Recipient Party, (b) is or becomes generally known to the public or is otherwise deemed to be in the public domain through no wrongful act of the Recipient Party, (c) is received from a third party who has the legal right to so furnish such Confidential Information, or (d) the Recipient Party can demonstrate is independently developed by or for the Recipient Party without use of Confidential Information.
5. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party with respect to any Confidential Information disclosed by it hereunder, the Recipient Party shall return to the Disclosing Party any or all of such information and all copies, contracts or other reproductions in whole or in part thereof or, with the written permission of such Disclosing Party, effect the destruction of all of same and certify such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party.
6. Each party acknowledges that the other party has no legal obligation pursuant to this agreement to disclose information to it hereunder but is doing so as an accommodation to the Recipient Party in reliance upon the terms of this agreement and that all information received by the Recipient Party hereunder cannot be relied upon as a representation or warranty of the Disclosing Party and, accordingly, no Disclosing Party shall be liable for any reliance upon any information disclosed by it hereunder, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Disclosing Party.
7. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as granting to either party any right, title or interest in any information disclosed hereunder to it, except for the limited right to use and disclosure as expressly permitted hereunder.
8. Each Recipient Party shall on any copies it may make of any information received hereunder maintain any and all copyright, patent or trademark notices which may appear on such information when so received.
9. Each party represents that the disclosure by it of information hereunder does not violate the rights of any other entity.
10. If either Party breaches its promises made in this Agreement, the non-breaching Party will have available to it all remedies available under law.
11. This agreement shall become effective on the date it is fully executed and delivered by both parties and both this agreement and the duties of the parties hereunder shall continue for a period of two years after the last disclosure of information made hereunder.
12. This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party and its successors. No representations have been made to induce either party to enter this agreement other than those expressly stated herein. This agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or expressions of intent or understanding and is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. Neither party shall be charged with any waiver of any provision of this agreement unless such waiver is evidenced by a writing signed by an authorized officer of such party and any such waiver shall be limited to the terms of such writing. This agreement shall not be changed or terminated, except by a writing signed by an authorized officer of Symmetrex and an authorized officer of Other Party. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to the conflicts of law principles of that state.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this agreement as of the date stated above.

"NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
Annex D
MICROSOFT CORPORATION NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
(STANDARD RECIPROCAL)
This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is made and entered into as of the later of the two signature dates below by and between MICROSOFT CORPORATION, a Washington corporation (""Microsoft""), and STARBAND COMMUNICATIONS INC./DELAWARE corporation (""Company"").
IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE MUTUAL DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
1. Definition of Confidential Information and Exclusions.
(a) ""Confidential Information"" means nonpublic information that a party to this Agreement (""Disclosing Party"") designates as being confidential to the party that receives such information (""Receiving Party"") or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential by the Receiving Party. ""Confidential Information"" includes, without limitation, information in tangible or intangible form relating to and/or including released or unreleased Disclosing Party software or hardware products, the marketing or promotion of any Disclosing Party product, Disclosing Party's business policies or practices, and information received from others that Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential. Except as otherwise indicated in this Agreement, the term ""Disclosing Party"" also includes all Affiliates of the Disclosing Party and, except as otherwise indicated, the term ""Receiving Party"" also includes all Affiliates of the Receiving Party. An ""Affiliate"" means any person, partnership, joint venture, corporation or other form of enterprise, domestic or foreign, including but not limited to subsidiaries, that directly or indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with a party.
(b) Confidential Information shall not include any information, however designated, that: (i) is or subsequently becomes publicly available without Receiving Party's breach of any obligation owed Disclosing Party; (ii) became known to Receiving Party prior to Disclosing Party's disclosure of such information to Receiving Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; (iii) became known to Receiving Party from a source other than Disclosing Party other than by the breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Disclosing Party; (iv) is independently developed by Receiving Party; or (v) constitutes Feedback (as defined in Section 5 of this Agreement).
2. Obligations Regarding Confidential Information
(a) Receiving Party shall:
(i) Refrain from disclosing any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to third parties for two (2) years following the date that Disclosing Party first discloses such Confidential Information to Receiving Party, except as expressly provided in Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of this Agreement;
(ii) Take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party;
(iii) Refrain from disclosing, reproducing, summarizing and/or distributing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party except in pursuance of Receiving Party's business relationship with Disclosing Party, and only as otherwise provided hereunder; and
(iv) Refrain from reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling any software code and/or pre-release hardware devices disclosed by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party under the terms of this Agreement, except as expressly permitted by applicable law.
(b) Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order, provided that Receiving Party either (i) gives the undersigned Disclosing Party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure to allow Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order or equivalent, or (ii) obtains written assurance from the applicable judicial or governmental entity that it will afford the Confidential Information the highest level of protection afforded under applicable law or regulation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not disclose any computer source code that contains Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order unless it complies with the requirement set forth in sub-section (i) of this Section 2(b).
(c) The undersigned Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to Receiving Party's employees and consultants on a need-to-know basis. The undersigned Receiving Party will have executed or shall execute appropriate written agreements with third parties sufficient to enable Receiving Party to enforce all the provisions of this Agreement.
(d) Receiving Party shall notify the undersigned Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party and its employees and consultants, and will cooperate with Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.
(e) Receiving Party shall, at Disclosing Party's request, return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information and all other tangible materials and devices provided to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information, or at Disclosing Party's option, certify destruction of the same.
3. Remedies
The parties acknowledge that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.
4. Miscellaneous
(a) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the property of Disclosing Party. By disclosing Confidential information to Receiving Party, Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right to Receiving Party to or under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information except as otherwise provided herein. Disclosing Party reserves without prejudice the ability to protect its rights under any such patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets except as otherwise provided herein.
(b) In the event that the Disclosing Party provides any computer software and/or hardware to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement, such computer software and/or hardware may only be used by the Receiving Party for evaluation and providing Feedback (as defined in Section 5 of this Agreement) to the Disclosing Party. Unless otherwise agreed by the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, all such computer software and/or hardware is provided ""AS IS"" without warranty of any kind, and Receiving Party agrees that neither Disclosing Party nor its suppliers shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising from or relating to Receiving Party's use or inability to use such software and/or hardware.
(c) The parties agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to (i) any Confidential Information, or (ii) any product (or any part thereof), process or service that is the direct product of the Confidential Information, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. For additional information on exporting Microsoft products, see http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/.
(d) The terms of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other party's Confidential Information. Further, the Receiving Party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or work with the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, provided that the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Confidential Information except as expressly permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The term ""residuals"" means information in intangible form, which is retained in memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. The Receiving Party shall not have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. However, this sub-paragraph shall not be deemed to grant to the Receiving Party a license under the Disclosing Party's copyrights or patents.
(e) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.
(f) If either Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of the State of Washington, and the parties further consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior of King County, Washington. Company waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.
(g) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party's respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that neither party may assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of the other party. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.
(h) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
(i) Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination.
5. Suggestions and Feedback
The Receiving Party may from time to time provide suggestions, comments or other feedback (""Feedback"") to the Disclosing Party with respect to Confidential Information provided originally by the Disclosing Party. Both parties agree that all Feedback is and shall be given entirely voluntarily. Feedback, even if designated as confidential by the party offering the Feedback, shall not, absent a separate written agreement, create any confidentiality obligation for the receiver of the Feedback. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided herein or in a separate subsequent written agreement between the parties, the receiver of the Feedback shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the term Confidential Information will not include information which:
(i) is or becomes generally available to the public, through no fault of the Receiving Party or its Representatives; provided, however, that specific aspects or details of Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the public domain, or in the possession of the Receiving Party in accordance with Section (b)(ii), merely because the Confidential Information is embraced by more general information in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party. Further, any combination of Confidential Information will not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party in accordance with Section (b)(ii) merely because individual elements of such Confidential Information are in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party;
(ii) can be demonstrated by documentation or competent proof to have been in the possession of the Receiving Party before its being furnished to the Receiving Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party, provided that the Receiving Party does not know, or have a reasonable basis for concluding, that the source of such information was bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information;
(iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, provided that the Receiving Party does not know or have reason to believe that the source is bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Disclosing Party with respect to such information; or
(iv) the Disclosing Party agrees in writing is not Confidential Information.

Section 2. Disclosure of Confidential Information. In connection with the consideration of a Possible Transaction, the Company and the Potential Relationship Party may deliver or make available (or prior to the date hereof may have delivered or made available) to the other and its Representatives certain information concerning its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities. As a condition to such information being furnished to the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives, the Receiving Party agrees that the Receiving Party will, and will cause the Receiving Party’s Representatives to, treat the Confidential Information in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and take or abstain from taking certain other actions as set forth herein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party is required to disclose any particular information to the other and any disclosure is entirely voluntary and is not intended to be construed as: (a) granting rights by license or otherwise under any trademark, patent, copyright or other intellectual property right; (b) creating a commitment as to any product, including the development or functionality of any product; (c) soliciting any business or incurring any obligation not specified herein; or
(d) prohibiting either Party from associating themselves with competitors of the other Party for purposes substantially similar to those involved herein.
Section 3. Use and Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information and Discussion Information.
(a) The Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives will use Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party solely for the purpose of evaluating and negotiating a Possible Transaction with the Disclosing Party and for no other purpose, and that such Confidential Information will not be used in any way detrimental to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party further agrees that it will and will cause its Representatives to take those steps the Receiving Party takes to protect its own similar proprietary and confidential information (which will not be less than a reasonable standard of care) to keep the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party confidential; provided, however, that (i) the Receiving Party may make any disclosure of the Confidential Information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of the Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Receiving Party’s Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction, who are provided with a copy of this Agreement and who agree to be bound by the terms this Agreement. The Parties will maintain a list of those Representatives to whom Confidential Information has been disclosed (which list will be presented to the Party upon the other Party’s request). In any event, the Receiving Party agrees to undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, to accept responsibility for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives, and, at the Receiving Party’s sole expense, to take all reasonable measures (including court proceedings) to restrain the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or uses of the Confidential Information.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) the Receiving Party or its Representatives may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if required in order to establish its rights under this Agreement, but only to the extent such disclosure is necessary and provided that the Receiving Party seeks confidential treatment of the Confidential Information to be disclosed;
(ii) this Agreement will not prohibit or restrict either Party’s right to develop, make, use, market, license or distribute products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other Party disclosed in the Confidential Information as long as such Party does not thereby breach this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other Party disclosed in the Confidential Information; and
(iii) either Party will be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or work with Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. The term “residuals” means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information so long as such persons have not studied the information for the purpose of replicating the same from memory. Neither Party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals.
(c) Each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person the fact that the other Party or its Representative have received Confidential Information or that Confidential Information has been made available to the other Party or its Representatives, that investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any Possible Transaction, including the status this Agreement and the identity of the parties hereto (collectively, the “Discussion Information”), provided that the Receiving Party may make such disclosure if required by law or the applicable rules of any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system. The Potential Relationship Party further agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or denied), the Potential Relationship Party and the Potential Relationship Party’s Representatives will not, directly or indirectly, consult or share Confidential Information or Discussion Information with, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or any discussions which might lead to any such agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any co-investor, source of equity financing or other person (other than the Company) regarding a Possible Transaction, including discussions or other communications with any prospective bidder for the Company with respect to (i) whether or not the Receiving Party or such other prospective bidder will make a bid or offer for the Disclosing Party or (ii) the price that the Receiving Party or such other bidder may bid or offer for the Disclosing Party.
(d) To the extent that any Confidential Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the Parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and will not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by a Party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege will remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any Party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.
Section 4. Required Actions if Disclosure is Legally Sought or Compelled. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may in its sole discretion seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives are nonetheless, in the written opinion of outside legal counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information or Discussion Information to any tribunal, the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information which such counsel advises the Receiving Party is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Receiving Party will use the Receiving Party’s reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and the Discussion Information, including by cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information and the Discussion Information by such tribunal; and provided further that the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of (i) the Receiving Party’s determination to make such disclosure and (ii) the nature, scope and contents of such disclosure.
Section 5. Return and Destruction of Confidential Information. In the event that the Receiving Party decides not to proceed with a Possible Transaction, the Receiving Party will promptly inform the Disclosing Party of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party in its sole discretion and for any reason, the Receiving Party will as directed by the Disclosing Party promptly deliver, at the Receiving Party’s expense, to the Disclosing Party or destroy all Confidential Information furnished to the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s Representatives by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant hereto. In the event of such a decision or request, all other Confidential Information prepared by the Receiving Party or on the Receiving Party’s behalf will be returned or destroyed and, upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written confirmation of the Receiving Party’s compliance with this paragraph; provided, however, that
(a) if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Confidential Information, such material will not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered;
(b) the Receiving Party will not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Confidential Information held electronically in archive or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or backup policies and further provided that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use reasonable measures to cause its employees not to, access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up;
(c) the Receiving Party will not be obligated to return or destroy Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to retain a copy pursuant to applicable law; and
(d) one copy of all Confidential Information may be kept by the Receiving Party’s outside counsel, if any, and such Confidential Information shall be fully protected by attorney-client privilege.
Notwithstanding the return, destruction or continued possession pursuant to the terms of this Section 5 of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives will continue to be bound by the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and other obligations and agreements hereunder.
Section 6. No Agreement. Each Patty understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Possible Transaction will be deemed to exist between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including breach of contract) in connection with any Possible Transaction unless and until the Parties will have entered into a final definitive agreement. The Parties also agree that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The Company further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, with due notice to reject any and all proposals made by the Potential Relationship Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Possible Transaction to determine not to engage in discussions or negotiations and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the Potential Relationship Party at any time, and to conduct, directly or through any of its Representatives, any process for any transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, if and as they in their sole discretion determine (including negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to the Potential Relationship Party or any other person). Section 7. Representations and Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it has the right to enter into this Agreement and that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of such Party relating to the matters herein. Each Party further represents and warrants that the terms of this Agreement are not inconsistent with other contractual obligations, express or implied, which such Party may have or any law applicable to such Party or its business. The Receiving Party understands, acknowledges and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information by virtue of this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Receiving Party or to any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom.
Section 8. Material Non-Public Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Receiving Party is aware (and that the Receiving Party’s Representatives are aware or, upon receipt of any Confidential Information or Discussion Information, will be advised by the Receiving Party) that (a) the Confidential Information being furnished to the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s Representatives contains material, non-public information regarding the Disclosing Party and (b) the United States and other non-U.S. securities laws prohibit any persons who have material, nonpublic information concerning the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, including the Discussion Information, from purchasing or selling securities of a company which may be a party to a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or from communicating such information to any person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
Section 9. No Solicitation. In consideration of the Confidential Information being furnished hereunder, each Party agrees that, for a period of six months from the date of this Agreement, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment with such Party or any of its Affiliates, any of the officers or employees of the other Party or its Affiliates (a) with whom such Party has had contact during the evaluation of a Possible Transaction or (b) who were identified by name and function to such Party by an officer or employee of the other Party with whom such Party or its Representatives had contact during the evaluation of a Possible Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, employees whose names are provided by the other Party in response to a request made by such Party or its Representatives during the evaluation of a Possible Transaction are covered by this non-solicitation obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict or preclude either Party from (i) making generalized searches for employees (by use of advertisements in the media, the engagement of search firms or otherwise), (ii) continuing its ordinary course hiring practices that are not targeted specifically at employees of the other Party, (iii) hiring an employee of the other Party who first initiates an employment discussion with such Party, in each case, so long as such Party has not violated the restrictions on solicitation contained in this Agreement or (iv) if the employee is no more on the rolls of the Party.
Section 10. Standstill.
(a) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Potential Relationship Party nor any of the Potential Relationship Party’s Representatives acting on the Potential Relationship Party’s behalf, or any person with whom any of the foregoing may be deemed to be acting in concert with respect to the Company or its securities, owns any securities of the Company to the best of their knowledge, information and belief and shall not own more than 5% during the tenure of this Agreement. The Potential Relationship Party agrees that during the Standstill Period, unless specifically invited in writing by the Company, neither the Potential Relationship Party nor any of the Potential Relationship Party’s Affiliates, subsidiaries or Representatives acting on the Potential Relationship Party’s behalf or on behalf of other persons acting in concert with the Potential Relationship Party will in any manner, directly or indirectly:

(ii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, (i) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or (ii) any demand for a copy of the Company’s stock ledger, list of stockholders or any other books and records of the Company;
(iii) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined under the Exchange Act) with respect to the Company or otherwise act in concert with any person in respect of any such securities;
(iv) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek representation on or to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company or to obtain representation on the Board of Directors of the Company;

(c) The Potential Relationship Party also agrees during the Standstill Period not to request that the Company or any of its Representatives, directly or indirectly, amend or waive any provision of this ARTICLE I Section 10.
(d) The Potential Relationship Party agrees that, if at any time during the Standstill Period, the Potential Relationship Party or any of the Potential Relationship Party’s Affiliates or subsidiaries or Representatives acting on the Potential Relationship Party’s behalf are approached by any third party concerning the Potential Relationship Party’s or their participation in a transaction involving any assets, indebtedness or business of, or securities issued by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Potential Relationship Party will promptly inform the Company of the nature of such transaction and the parties involved.
(e) The banks approached by the Potential Relationship Party for the purpose of financing would be subject to confidentiality obligations as set forth in said Section 3, without, however, requiring such recipient bank, or its representatives, to make the Standstill undertakings stipulated in the current Section 10 of the Agreement.
(f) The non-solicitation and stand-still obligations under Sections 9 and 10 will cease to apply on completion of the transaction.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
Steven Yari
Triyar Companies, Inc.
c/o Todd Jadwin
Alexander Dunham Securities, Inc.
350 S. Grand
Suite 3570
Los Angeles, CA 90071
Dear Steven:
You have requested information regarding Home Products International, Inc. (the “Company”, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is referred to herein as “us” or “we”) in connection with your consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a “Possible Transaction”). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:
Confidentiality of Evaluation Materials
You will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, Mesirow Financial, Inc. (“Mesirow”), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives (as defined hereinafter) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the “Evaluation Materials”). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this agreement
The term “Evaluation Materials” includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as “confidential”. The term “Evaluation Materials” does not include information which, you establish through written documentation, (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you without violating your obligations hereunder. The terms of this section “Confidentiality of Evaluation Materials” shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.
Use of Evaluation Materials
You will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), and lenders (collectively, “your representatives”) who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you, and shall each expressly agree (in writing, if requested by the Company or its advisors), to treat such information confidential in accordance with the agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated, neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. In any event, neither you nor any of your representatives will use the Evaluation Materials in any way which is or may be detrimental to the Company. You will be responsible for any breach of this agreement by you or your representatives. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company reserves the right not to make available hereunder any information, the provision of which is determined by us, in our sole discretion, to be inadvisable or inappropriate or competitively sensitive.
In the event that you or any of your representatives received a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials. The terms of this section “Use of Evaluation Materials” shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.
Non-Disclosure
The disclosure of your possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated or a disclosure is made prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law or regulatory authority, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person (including, but not limited to, any customer, employee, supplier, creditor or competitor of the Company) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof, nor will you or any of your representatives make inquiry about the Company’s business to any customer, employee, supplier, creditor or competitor of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you further agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding or any discussions that any lead to such agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person (other than the Company) regarding a Possible Transaction. The term “person” as used in this agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, limited liability company, association or individual. The terms of this section “Non-Disclosure” shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.
Securities Law Compliance
You acknowledge that the Evaluation Materials represent, in part, material, non-public information regarding the Company and its prospects. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you and your representatives understand that the securities laws of the United States prohibit any person who has material, non-public information concerning the Company or a Possible Transaction from purchasing or selling securities in reliance upon such information or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
Return of Documents
Upon the Company’s request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company.
No Unauthorized Contact or Solicitation
During the course of your evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to Mesirow or employees or representatives of the Company specified by Mesirow. Accordingly, you and your representatives agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express written consent of Mesirow. You also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by you and such third parry without the prior written consent of the Company.
Without the Company’s prior written consent, neither you nor any of your affiliates will for a period of two years from the date of this agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment or employ any of the officers or employees of the Company (or any person whose activities are dedicated to the Company).
Standstill
You agree that until two years from the date of this agreement, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, neither you nor any of your representatives will (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. Except as provided above, you also agree during such period not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives) to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.
No Representation or Warranty
Although the Company and Mesirow have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of your investigation, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, Mesirow or any of the Company’s other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, Mesirow or any of the Company’s other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to you or any other person resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by you or any of your representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (“Sale Agreement”) when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect. For purposes of this agreement, the term “Sale Agreement” does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by you.
You also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, and you hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto. You also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and you with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.
You further understand and agree that (i) the Company and Mesirow shall be free to conduct the process for the Company’s sale as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any of the prospective buyers and entering into a Sale Agreement without prior notice to you or to any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such sale may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person and (iii) you shall not have any claims whatsoever against the Company, Mesirow or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, owners, affiliates, agents or representatives arising out of or relating to the sale of the Company.
Legal Remedy
You understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this agreement by you or your representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this agreement by you or your representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. You further agree not to raise as a defense or objection to the request or granting of such relief that any breach of this agreement is or would be compensable by an award of money damages and to waive any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.
Other
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof This agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.
If any term or provision of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms and provisions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
The parties understand and agree that no failure or delay by the other party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois applicable to contracts made and to be performed therein. You irrevocably and unconditionally agree to submit to personal jurisdiction and service and venue exclusively in any federal or state court within the State of Illinois having subject matter jurisdiction over any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement and the rights and obligations contained herein and waive any objection you may have to such jurisdiction, service and venue.
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this agreement, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.
Very truly yours,

The Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate (a) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of acts by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in breach of the terms of this Agreement, (b) was in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Company, provided that such information, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge, was not subject to another confidentiality agreement with the Company or another party, (c) has been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to, or the use of, any Confidential Information or (d) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge, not bound by any duty or obligation of confidentiality on a non-confidential basis.
3. Limitations on Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. (a) The Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction. The Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep the Confidential Information in confidence and shall not disclose any of the Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) the Receiving Party may make disclosure of information contained in the Confidential Information if required by applicable law, regulation or legal or regulatory process; provided, that the Receiving Party shall have first complied with the terms of Section 9 hereof, (ii) the Receiving Party may make disclosure of information contained in the Confidential Information to the extent that the Company gives its prior written consent, and (iii) any information contained in the Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Receiving Party’s Representatives who reasonably require access to such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and who agree to keep such information in confidence to the same extent as described herein; provided, further, that the Receiving Party shall not make any disclosure of any Confidential Information to any potential sources of equity financing without the Company’s prior written consent. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or by any of its Representatives.
(b) The Receiving Party agrees that, for a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall not (and shall cause its affiliates, subject to Section 22 hereof, not to), directly or indirectly, (i) use the Confidential Information to divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of the Company or (ii) employ or solicit, or initiate contact for employment with, any (A) director, officer or other senior or key employee of the Company or (B) any other employee of the Company whom the Receiving Party meets during its evaluation of the possible Transaction or about whom the Receiving Party receives Confidential Information; provided, however, a general advertisement or other recruiting efforts not specifically targeting any such employees of the Company shall not be considered a solicitation or unauthorized hiring.
(c) If the Receiving Party discovers any unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information by it or its Representatives, the Receiving Party hereby covenants to promptly notify the Company in writing of any such unauthorized disclosure or use.
4. Non-Disclosure of Existence of Negotiations.

5. No Representations by the Company. The Company will have the exclusive authority to decide what Confidential Information (if any) is to be made available to the Receiving Party and its Representatives. Neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, attorneys, accountants and affiliates (collectively, the “Company Representatives”) will be under any obligation to make any particular Confidential Information available to the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives or to supplement or update any Confidential Information previously furnished. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Representatives has made or is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information, and neither the Company nor any of the Company Representatives will have any liability to the Receiving Party or to any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of any Confidential Information or any inaccuracies or errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations and warranties (if any) that are included in any final definitive written agreement that provides for the consummation of a negotiated transaction between the Receiving Party and the Company and is validly executed on behalf of the Receiving Party and the Company will have legal effect.
6. Standstill Agreement. In consideration of the Confidential Information being furnished to the Receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Receiving Party agrees that, for a period of one year from the date of this Agreement (or, such shorter period agreed to by the Company with a third party who is provided access to the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction, the “Standstill Period”), unless expressly requested by the Company or its Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) in writing, the Receiving Party shall not (and shall cause its affiliates not to and shall cause its and their respective Representatives acting at its and their respective behalf not to): (a) in any manner acting alone or in concert with others, acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, by means of purchase, merger, business combination or in any other manner, beneficial ownership of any securities of the Company, direct or indirect rights to acquire any securities of the Company (including any derivative securities with economic equivalents of ownership of any of such securities), any right to vote or to direct the voting of any securities of the Company or any assets of the Company, (b) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the Company, (c) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, other than any group comprised solely of the Receiving Party and its affiliates, (d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control, advise, change or influence the management, board of directors, governing instruments, policies or affairs of the Company, (e) make any public disclosure, or take any action that could require the Company to make any public disclosure, with respect to any of the matters set forth in this Agreement, other than the required amendment to the Receiving Party’s Schedule 13D filing as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (f) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (g) have any discussions or enter into any arrangements (whether written or oral) with, or advise, assist or encourage any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing. The Receiving Party also agrees during such period not to request the Company or any of the Company Representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this Section 6 (including this sentence). Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Standstill Period shall terminate immediately if, after the date of this Agreement, (A) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third party to effectuate a sale of 50% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company or 50% or more of the Company’s outstanding equity securities, (B) the Company publicly announces the conclusion of its previously announced strategic review process without a definitive agreement to sell the Company, (C) the Company makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commences any proceeding under any bankruptcy reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation law of any jurisdiction or (D) any bankruptcy petition is filed or any such proceeding is commenced against the Company and either (1) the Company indicates its approval thereof, consent thereto or acquiescence therein, or (2) such petition application or proceeding is not dismissed within 30 days and (ii) the Standstill Period solely with respect to clause (b) of this Section 6 shall terminate ten days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period for stockholders to nominate directors for election at the Company’s 2012 annual stockholders meeting to be scheduled in accordance with Section 8 hereof (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions in clauses (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 6 shall not apply to the activities that were previously expressly prohibited by clause (b) of this Section 6 in the event the restrictions in clause (b) are terminated pursuant to this clause (ii)).
7. Return of Confidential Information. Promptly upon the written request of the Company, the Receiving Party will return all copies of the Confidential Information to the Company, and all notes, studies, reports, memoranda and other documents or materials prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives that contain or reflect any Confidential Information shall be destroyed. Notwithstanding the return to the Company or destruction of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 7, the Receiving Party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by their confidentiality obligations and other obligations under this Agreement for the term hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Receiving Party’s legal department and/or outside counsel may keep one copy of the Confidential Information (in electronic or paper form) and, with respect to the Receiving Party’s Representatives who are accounting firms, such firms may keep one copy of the Confidential Information, in each case, if required to comply with applicable law or regulation and (b) the Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain Confidential Information to the extent it is “backed-up” on its or their (as the case may be) electronic information management and communications systems or servers, is not available to an end user and cannot be expunged without considerable effort; provided, that any such information so retained pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 7 shall be held in compliance with the terms of this Agreement for a period of eighteen months from the date hereof.
8. 2012 Annual Stockholders Meeting. The Company agrees (a) that the meeting date for its 2012 annual stockholders meeting (with respect to the Company’s fiscal year ended January 28, 2012) will be held no earlier than thirty-one days after the first anniversary of the Company’s 2011 annual stockholders meeting (with respect to the Company’s fiscal year ended January 29, 2011) and (b) to provide the Receiving Party a copy of the press release announcing the date of its 2012 annual meeting on the date such press release is publicly issued.
9. Subpoena or Court Order. In the event that the Receiving Party or anyone to whom it discloses the Confidential Information receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information under the terms of a subpoena or other order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another governmental agency, the Receiving Party shall if permitted pursuant to applicable law (a) promptly notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (b) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow such request, (c) if disclosure of such Confidential Information or Discussion Information is required, furnish only such portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information as the Receiving Party is advised by its legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and
(d) if requested by the Company, cooperate with the Company in its efforts to obtain a protective order or other relief to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information, as applicable, that is required to be disclosed.
10. Definitive Agreement. Unless and until a definitive written agreement between the Receiving Party and the Company with respect to a Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither the Receiving Party nor the Company will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression by either of them or their Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.
11. Remedies. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that in the event of any breach of the terms of this Agreement, the other party could not be made whole by monetary damages only. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction (which shall include a temporary restraining order) to prevent breaches of the terms of this Agreement.
12. Communications. Without the Company’s prior written consent, which may be withheld by the Company in its sole discretion, the Receiving Party shall not (and shall cause its Representatives not to) initiate, other than through the Company’s financial and legal advisors or such other persons, as designated by the Company in writing, any (a) communication concerning the Confidential Information, (b) requests for meetings with management of the Company in connection with the possible Transaction or other transaction between the parties or (c) communication relating to the business of the Company or the possible Transaction, in each case, with any officer, director or employee of the Company.
13. Securities Laws. The Receiving Party acknowledges that it is aware and that the Receiving Party and its Representatives have been advised that the United States securities laws prohibit any person having non-public material information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of that company or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.
14. Entire Agreement; Amendments.

18. Captions. The Captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of any provisions of this Agreement.
19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

Attention: Stefan Kaluzny
 Managing Director
Dear Mr. Kaluzny:
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality Agreement (this “Agreement”) is dated as of January 27, 2012 by and between Sycamore Partners Management, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the “Receiving Party”) and The Talbots, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”).
1. Confidential Information; Representatives. (a) The Receiving Party is considering a possible business combination transaction (whether negotiated directly with the Company’s Board of Directors or otherwise) with respect to the Company (the “Transaction”), and, in order to assist the Receiving Party in evaluating the possible Transaction, the Company is prepared to make available to the Receiving Party certain information concerning the business, operations, strategy and prospects of the Company (all such information, the “Confidential Information”). As a condition to the Confidential Information being furnished to the Receiving Party and the directors, officers, principals, partners, members, employees, agents, consultants, related investment funds, advisors, attorneys, accountants, affiliates, potential sources of capital and financing, and financial advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) of the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party agrees to treat the Confidential Information strictly in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and to otherwise comply, and to cause its Representatives to comply, with all obligations hereinafter set forth.
(b) The term “Confidential Information” shall include, without limitation, any and all information concerning the Company and its business, operations, strategic initiatives, financing, employees, strategies or prospects that is furnished to the Receiving Party or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company, whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any written or oral analyses, business or strategic plans, compilations, studies, data, reports, interpretations, projections, forecasts, records, notes, copies, excerpts, memoranda, documents or other materials (in whatever form maintained or conveyed, whether documentary, computerized, verbal form or otherwise), that contain or otherwise reflect Confidential Information concerning the Company or its business, operations, strategic initiatives, financing, employees, strategies or prospects prepared by or on behalf of the Receiving Party, any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives, the Company or any Company Representatives (as defined below) or that otherwise reflect any conversations with Company Representatives involving or relating to the Confidential Information.
2. Excluded Information. The Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate (a) is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of acts by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in breach of the terms of this Agreement, (b) was in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Company, provided that such information, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge, was not subject to another confidentiality agreement with the Company or another party, (c) has been independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to, or the use of, any Confidential Information or (d) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge, not bound by any duty or obligation of confidentiality on a non-confidential basis.
3. Limitations on Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. (a) The Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction. The Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep the Confidential Information in confidence and shall not disclose any of the Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) the Receiving Party may make disclosure of information contained in the Confidential Information if required by applicable law, regulation or legal or regulatory process; provided, that the Receiving Party shall have first complied with the terms of Section 9 hereof, (ii) the Receiving Party may make disclosure of information contained in the Confidential Information to the extent that the Company gives its prior written consent, and (iii) any information contained in the Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Receiving Party’s Representatives who reasonably require access to such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and who agree to keep such information in confidence to the same extent as described herein; provided, further, that the Receiving Party shall not make any disclosure of any Confidential Information to any potential sources of equity financing without the Company’s prior written consent. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or by any of its Representatives.
(b) The Receiving Party agrees that, for a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall not (and shall cause its affiliates, subject to Section 22 hereof, not to), directly or indirectly, (i) use the Confidential Information to divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of the Company or (ii) employ or solicit, or initiate contact for employment with, any (A) director, officer or other senior or key employee of the Company or (B) any other employee of the Company whom the Receiving Party meets during its evaluation of the possible Transaction or about whom the Receiving Party receives Confidential
Information; provided, however, a general advertisement or other recruiting efforts not specifically targeting any such employees of the Company shall not be considered a solicitation or unauthorized hiring.
(c) If the Receiving Party discovers any unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information by it or its Representatives, the Receiving Party hereby covenants to promptly notify the Company in writing of any such unauthorized disclosure or use.
4. Non-Disclosure of Existence of Negotiations. Without the prior written consent of the Company or except as may be required by applicable law or regulation, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall not disclose to any person that any discussions or negotiations are taking place between the parties concerning a possible Transaction, including the content, timing and status of such discussions or negotiations (the “Discussion Information”).
5. No Representations by the Company. The Company will have the exclusive authority to decide what Confidential Information (if any) is to be made available to the Receiving Party and its Representatives. Neither the Company nor any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, advisors, attorneys, accountants and affiliates (collectively, the “Company Representatives”) will be under any obligation to make any particular Confidential Information available to the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives or to supplement or update any Confidential Information previously furnished. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Representatives has made or is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information, and neither the Company nor any of the Company Representatives will have any liability to the Receiving Party or to any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of any Confidential Information or any inaccuracies or errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations and warranties (if any) that are included in any final definitive written agreement that provides for the consummation of a negotiated transaction between the Receiving Party and the Company and is validly executed on behalf of the Receiving Party and the Company will have legal effect.
6. Standstill Agreement. In consideration of the Confidential Information being furnished to the Receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Receiving Party agrees that, for a period of one year from the date of this Agreement (or, such shorter period agreed to by the Company with a third party who is provided access to the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction, the “Standstill Period”), unless expressly requested by the Company or its Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) in writing, the Receiving Party shall not (and shall cause its affiliates not to and shall cause its and their respective Representatives acting at its and their respective behalf not to): (a) in any manner acting alone or in concert with others, acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, by means of purchase, merger, business combination or in any other manner, beneficial ownership of any securities of the Company, direct or indirect rights to acquire any securities of the Company (including any derivative securities with economic equivalents of ownership of
any of such securities), any right to vote or to direct the voting of any securities of the Company or any assets of the Company, (b) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the Company, (c) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, other than any group comprised solely of the Receiving Party and its affiliates, (d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control, advise, change or influence the management, board of directors, governing instruments, policies or affairs of the Company, (e) make any public disclosure, or take any action that could require the Company to make any public disclosure, with respect to any of the matters set forth in this Agreement, other than the required amendment to the Receiving Party’s Schedule 13D filing as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (f) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (g) have any discussions or enter into any arrangements (whether written or oral) with, or advise, assist or encourage any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing. The Receiving Party also agrees during such period not to request the Company or any of the Company Representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this Section 6 (including this sentence). Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Standstill Period shall terminate immediately if, after the date of this Agreement, (A) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a third party to effectuate a sale of 50% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company or 50% or more of the Company’s outstanding equity securities, (B) the Company publicly announces the conclusion of its previously announced strategic review process without a definitive agreement to sell the Company, (C) the Company makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commences any proceeding under any bankruptcy reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation law of any jurisdiction or (D) any bankruptcy petition is filed or any such proceeding is commenced against the Company and either (1) the Company indicates its approval thereof, consent thereto or acquiescence therein, or (2) such petition application or proceeding is not dismissed within 30 days and (ii) the Standstill Period solely with respect to clause (b) of this Section 6 shall terminate ten days prior to the expiration of the applicable time period for stockholders to nominate directors for election at the Company’s 2012 annual stockholders meeting to be scheduled in accordance with Section 8 hereof (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions in clauses (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 6 shall not apply to the activities that were previously expressly prohibited by clause (b) of this Section 6 in the event the restrictions in clause (b) are terminated pursuant to this clause (ii)).
7. Return of Confidential Information. Promptly upon the written request of the Company, the Receiving Party will return all copies of the Confidential Information to the Company, and all notes, studies, reports, memoranda and other documents or materials prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives that contain or reflect any Confidential Information shall be destroyed. Notwithstanding the return to the Company or destruction of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 7, the Receiving Party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by their confidentiality obligations and other obligations under this Agreement for the term hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Receiving Party’s legal department and/or outside counsel may keep one copy of the Confidential Information (in electronic or paper form) and, with respect to the Receiving Party’s Representatives who are accounting firms, such firms may keep one copy of the Confidential Information, in each case, if required to comply with applicable law or regulation and (b) the Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain Confidential Information to the extent it is “backed-up” on its or their (as the case may be) electronic information management and communications systems or servers, is not available to an end user and cannot be expunged without considerable effort; provided, that any such information so retained pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 7 shall be held in compliance with the terms of this Agreement for a period of eighteen months from the date hereof.
8. 2012 Annual Stockholders Meeting. The Company agrees (a) that the meeting date for its 2012 annual stockholders meeting (with respect to the Company’s fiscal year ended January 28, 2012) will be held no earlier than thirty-one days after the first anniversary of the Company’s 2011 annual stockholders meeting (with respect to the Company’s fiscal year ended January 29, 2011) and (b) to provide the Receiving Party a copy of the press release announcing the date of its 2012 annual meeting on the date such press release is publicly issued.
9. Subpoena or Court Order. In the event that the Receiving Party or anyone to whom it discloses the Confidential Information receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information under the terms of a subpoena or other order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another governmental agency, the Receiving Party shall if permitted pursuant to applicable law (a) promptly notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (b) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow such request, (c) if disclosure of such Confidential Information or Discussion Information is required, furnish only such portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information as the Receiving Party is advised by its legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and (d) if requested by the Company, cooperate with the Company in its efforts to obtain a protective order or other relief to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information, as applicable, that is required to be disclosed.
10. Definitive Agreement. Unless and until a definitive written agreement between the Receiving Party and the Company with respect to a Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither the Receiving Party nor the Company will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression by either of them or their Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.
11. Remedies. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that in the event of any breach of the terms of this Agreement, the other party could not be made whole by monetary damages only. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law or in equity, shall be entitled to an injunction (which shall include a temporary restraining order) to prevent breaches of the terms of this Agreement.
12. Communications. Without the Company’s prior written consent, which may be withheld by the Company in its sole discretion, the Receiving Party shall not (and shall cause its Representatives not to) initiate, other than through the Company’s financial and legal advisors or such other persons, as designated by the Company in writing, any (a) communication concerning the Confidential Information, (b) requests for meetings with management of the Company in connection with the possible Transaction or other transaction between the parties or (c) communication relating to the business of the Company or the possible Transaction, in each case, with any officer, director or employee of the Company.
13. Securities Laws. The Receiving Party acknowledges that it is aware and that the Receiving Party and its Representatives have been advised that the United States securities laws prohibit any person having non-public material information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of that company or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.

CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FOR STRATEGIC MATTERS
This Confidential Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the effective date listed below (“Effective Date”) by Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) located at 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and the company designated below (“Company”).
Oracle and the Company are entering into discussions concerning a possible strategic transaction (the “Transaction”). The parties expect to make available to one another certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information, both oral and written, which may include information concerning their respective business prospects and plans, financial condition, technology, customers, know-how, trade secrets, operations, assets and liabilities (collectively, the “Evaluation Material”). As a condition to each party furnishing the Evaluation Material to the other party and the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors of such party or its subsidiaries (collectively, “Representatives”), each party agrees that the Evaluation Material furnished to it hereunder shall be treated as confidential subject to the terms of this Agreement.
1. Evaluation Material. “Evaluation Material” also includes notes, analyses, compilations, studies, plans, interpretations or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives which contain or are based upon the Evaluation Material furnished to such party hereunder. The term “Evaluation Material” does not include information that (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known or reasonably should be known by the receiving party to be bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to such information; (iii) is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Evaluation Material; or (v) is disclosed under operation of law.
2. Non-Disclosure/Security/Use. Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person any of the other party’s Evaluation Material, the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, or any terms or other facts relating to the Transaction and will use such Evaluation Materials only for the purpose of evaluating a Transaction. Each party agrees to use reasonable measures to protect against the loss, theft or unauthorized use of the Evaluation Materials.
3. Personally Identifiable Information. The Evaluation Materials may include human resources data and/or other information that serves to identify one or more individuals (“PII”). The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any request received by the receiving party for access, correction, amendment or redaction of any PII. The disclosing party shall be responsible for compliance with all such requests. The receiving party also agrees to notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected improper acquisition of PII of which the receiving party becomes aware.
4. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit either party’s ability to use “residuals” relating to the Evaluation Material of the other party. The term “residuals” shall mean information included in the Evaluation Material in nontangible form (i.e., not written or other documentary form, including tape or disk), which is incidentally retained in the memories of employees of either party who have had access to the Evaluation Material, including ideas, know-how, or techniques contained therein, and where the source of the Evaluation Material has become remote (e.g., as a result of the passage of time or the employee’s subsequent exposure to information of a similar nature from other sources) that the employee in good faith believes that it is not Evaluation Material. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its employees or to pay royalties to the other party in connection with any use of residuals.
5. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or preclude either party from developing, using, marketing, licensing, and/or selling any independently developed software, technology or other materials similar or related to the Evaluation Material without otherwise violating this Agreement.
6. Required Disclosure. In the event that a party or its Representatives is required by Law, rule or stock exchange regulation to disclose any of the other party’s Evaluation Material or the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, the party required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other party with prior written notice of any such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order, other remedy or waiver is not obtained, the party required to make the disclosure shall furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material that such party determines, alter consulting with counsel, is required to disclose and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the other party’s Evaluation Material.
7. Termination of Discussions. This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date. Promptly upon notice from either party that it does not wish to proceed with the Transaction, each party shall return to the other party or destroy all copies of the Evaluation Material (including all documents based thereon) in its possession or in the possession of its Representatives, except that outside counsel to the receiving party may retain one copy of the Evaluation Material for archival purposes and solely to comply with applicable law, rule or regulation. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for a period ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.
8. Definitive Agreements. Unless and until a final definitive agreement, regarding the Transaction has been executed, no contract or agreement with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties and neither party will be under any legal obligation whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The term “definitive agreement” does not include a term sheet or any other preliminary written agreement. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not provide Evaluation Material under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals with regard to the Transaction and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.
9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement with respect to the Evaluation Material disclosed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements concerning such Evaluation Material, whether written or oral. All additions or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and must be signed by both parties.
10. Miscellaneous. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be. invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby,
11. Governing Law, Jurisdiction. This Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the procedural and substantive laws of the state of California and shall be deemed executed in Redwood City, California. Any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in any state or federal court In San Francisco or San Mateo County, California. Company and Oracle irrevocably and unconditionally agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and agree that the venue is proper in, the aforesaid courts in any such legal action or proceeding.
12. Relief. Each party agrees that money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives, and that the other party is entitled specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENT
 This Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is entered into as of this 7th day of March, 2001, by and between Polycom, Inc. (""Polycom""), and PictureTel Corporation (""PictureTel""), a Delaware corporation.
WITNESSETH:
 WHEREAS, Polycom and PictureTel may consider engaging in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business combination involving PictureTel and Polycom or their respective subsidiaries (the ""Transaction"") and, prior to or during the course of any such discussions, PictureTel and Polycom each may have disclosed or, in the future, may disclose and make available to the other certain information concerning its business prospects, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities;
 WHEREAS, all such information furnished to a party or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of the other party (irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is so furnished before, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by a party or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to herein as the ""Confidential Information;"" and
 WHEREAS, each of Polycom and PictureTel hereby agrees to receive such Confidential Information of the other and to disclose such Confidential Information to the other subject to the following terms and conditions.
 NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
 1. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. (a) Each of PictureTel and Polycom shall (i) use the Confidential Information obtained from the other solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, executive officers and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers, consultants and attorneys) acting on its behalf (collectively, its ""Representatives"") who in each case, in such party's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and who are set forth on Annex A hereto, as it may be amended by the parties from time to time; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.
 (b) If either party is required (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that such party will provide the other party with prompt notice of such request so that such other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the notifying party's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order, either party is nonetheless compelled to disclose Confidential Information, such party may disclose, without liability hereunder, only that portion of the Confidential Information that such party is advised in writing by outside legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that such party gives to the other party written notice of the portion of the Confidential Information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon such other party's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.
 2. Non-Disclosure of Negotiations or Agreements. Except as required by law, neither PictureTel, Polycom nor their respective Representatives shall disclose to any person (including, without limitation, any director, officer or employee that is not set forth on Annex A) the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or agreements between them concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any similar terms, agreements or understandings between PictureTel and Polycom with respect thereto, or that such party has provided to or received from the other Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. The term ""person"" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include the media and any corporation, company, group, partnership or other entity or individual.
 3. Ownership of Confidential Information. Each party shall keep a reasonable record of the Confidential Information received by it and the location of such Confidential Information. All written Confidential Information delivered by one party hereto to the other party pursuant to the Agreement shall be and remain the property of the delivering party, and upon the written request of the delivering party, the receiving party shall (i) promptly return such Confidential Information and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof, (ii) destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, or other documents derived from or containing Confidential Information, and all copies and other reproductions and extracts thereof, and (iii) provide a certificate to the delivering party certifying that the foregoing materials have, in fact, been destroyed or returned, signed by an authorized officer supervising such destruction or return. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder. Each party will keep a record of each person, other than its Representatives, that is afforded access to the other party and/or the Confidential Information of the other party, and before such access is afforded, each party agrees to inform such person of the requirements of this Agreement. Each party will furnish to the other party, upon request, a written copy of such record of such persons, other than its Representatives, that have been afforded access to the other party and/or the Confidential Information.
 4. Information Not Deemed Confidential Information. The term ""Confidential Information"" does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, other than, as a result of a disclosure by the receiving party or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the delivering party or its Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the receiving party to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality to such delivering party or its Representatives; or (iii) was within the receiving party's possession prior to being furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the delivering party, provided that the person providing such information to the receiving party was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the delivering party or otherwise prohibited from transferring such information to the receiving party by any contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation.
 5. No Warranty. Neither PictureTel, Polycom nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy and completeness of any Confidential Information provided by it, and no liability shall result to the delivering party from its use, except as set forth in a definitive agreement for a Transaction. Only the representations and warranties that are made in a definitive agreement for a Transaction, when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, shall have any legal effect.
 6. No Agreement. Unless a definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between PictureTel and Polycom has been executed and delivered, neither Polycom, PictureTel nor any of their stockholders or affiliates will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this letter agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such Transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, to deny any request for Confidential Information (regardless of the reasonableness of such request) and to terminate discussions or negotiations with the other party at any time. Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of PictureTel and Polycom, which consent shall refer specifically to this paragraph (or such other provision) and explicitly make such waiver or amendment.
 7. Non Solicitation. Unless a Transaction is consummated, each party agrees that, for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date hereof, it will not hire or directly or indirectly solicit employment of (other than by means of a general advertisement) any of the
(i) employees of the other party with whom it has had contact during the process contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) management level personnel or officers of the other party. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to preclude the ability of the parties to compete with one another in the ordinary course and that each party will arrange with the Principal, President or Chief Financial Officer of the other party (and no other individuals) for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. Unless otherwise agreed by either party, all (i) communications regarding a possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, or (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures will be submitted or directed only to the President or Chief Financial Officer of the other party. Without the prior written consent of the President of the other party, neither party nor its Representatives will initiate, or cause to be initiated, any communication with any officer, director or employee of the other party concerning the Confidential Information or any possible Transaction.
 8. Non-Public Information. PictureTel has outstanding publicly-held securities and the Confidential Information contains material non-public information. Each of the parties acknowledges that it is (i) aware, and has advised or will advise its Representatives, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person in possession of material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, and from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person may purchase or sell such securities and (ii) familiar with the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and each party agrees that it will neither use nor permit any of its Representatives to use any Confidential Information in violation of such Act or rules or regulations, including, without limitation, Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3.
 9. Standstill. Each of the parties agrees that, until the expiration of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors or General Partners of the other party, it and its affiliates will not (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal or offer or otherwise seek to acquire, directly or indirectly any securities (or rights in respect thereof), assets or property of the other party or any of its subsidiaries, whether such agreements or proposals or offers are made with or to the other party (or any controlling person or successor thereof) or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) enter into or agree, offer, seek or propose to enter into or otherwise be involved in or part of, directly or indirectly, any merger, acquisition transaction or other business combination involving the other party or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets; (iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any ""solicitation"" of ""proxies"" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a ""group"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to any voting securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (v) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek or propose to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the other party; (vi) directly or indirectly enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with any other person with respect to any of the foregoing activities or propose any of such activities to any other person; or (vii) publicly disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing; (viii) directly or indirectly advise, encourage, provide assistance (including debt or equity financial assistance) to or hold discussions with or invest in any other person in connection with any of the foregoing. Each party also agrees that, during such eighteen month period, neither it nor any of its affiliates will: (i) request the other party or its advisors, directly or indirectly, to (1) amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (2) otherwise consent to any action inconsistent with any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence); or (ii) take any initiative with respect to the other party or any of its subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding (1) such initiative, (2) any of the activities referred to in this paragraph, (3) the possibility of a Transaction or any similar transaction or (4) the possibility of such party or any other person acquiring control of the other party, whether by means of a business combination or otherwise. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this Section 9 shall not apply to a party in the event of a bona fide publicly announced proposal, offer or agreement by a third party not acting in concert with such party (i) to acquire more than 51% of any class of stock (or rights in respect thereof) of the other party or (ii) to acquire the other party, or all or substantially all of its assets, by means of a merger, consolidation, asset purchase or other similar transaction. Additionally, the Principal or President of a party may contact the Principal or President of the other party for the purpose of expressing continuing or renewed interest in a Transaction, provided that, unless invited to do so by the President of the other party, no offer or proposal shall be made that would require public disclosure or formal consideration by such other party or its Board of Directors.
 10. No Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. Any waiver of a breach hereof shall be in writing and shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
 11. Remedies. Each party agrees to indemnify the other party from any damages, loss, cost or liability (including, without limitation, legal fees and the cost of enforcing this Agreement) arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosures of any Confidential Information by the other party or its Representatives. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either party and that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including specific performance and injunction, as a remedy for any such breach. Each party agrees to waive, and to use its best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees or agents to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by either party, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the non-breaching party.
 12. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents and their respective successors and assigns and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws and not the choice of law rules of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.
 14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found to violate any statute, regulation, rule, order, decision or decree of any governmental authority, court, agency or exchange, such invalidity shall not be deemed to affect any other provision hereof or the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and such invalid provision shall be deemed deleted herefrom to the minimum extent necessary to cure such violation.

PACKETEER, INC.
TWO WAY NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
THIS Agreement is made and entered into by and between PACKETEER, INC. (“Packeteer”) and Blue Coat Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, having offices at 420 North Mary Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, to assure the protection and preservation of the confidential and/or proprietary nature of each party’s confidential information. Each party will disclose such information solely for the purpose of evaluating the possibility of entering into a business relationship between the parties hereto (the “Purpose”). In reliance upon and in consideration of the following undertakings, the parties agree as follows:
1. Definition. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2, all information (including but not limited to ideas, techniques, works of authorship, models, inventions, know-how, processes, equipment, algorithms, software source documents and formulae related to the current, future, and proposed products and services of each of the parties and information concerning research, development, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, and marketing plans), disclosed by one party (the “Discloser”) to the other party (the “Recipient”) which is labeled or marked “Confidential” or with some other similar proprietary legend, or which, in the context of the disclosure, the Recipient has reason to believe is confidential, shall be deemed to be “Confidential Information.” If Confidential Information is disclosed in oral form, the Discloser shall identify it as confidential at the time of disclosure and thereafter summarize it in writing and transmit such summary to the Recipient within thirty (30) days of the oral disclosure.
2. Exclusions. “Confidential Information” excludes information which: (a) is now or hereafter becomes generally known or available, through no act or failure to act on Recipient’s part; (b) Recipient independently knows at the time of receiving such information; (c) a third party hereafter furnishes to Recipient without restriction on disclosure and without breach of any confidentiality obligations; (d) Recipient has independently developed without using any Confidential Information or breaching this Agreement; or (e) Discloser gives written permission to Recipient to disclose.
3. Restrictions/Obligations. Recipient shall: (a) only disclose the Confidential Information to those employees and contractors with a need to know; provided that Recipient binds those employees and contractors to terms at least as restrictive as those stated in this Agreement (or, with respect to professional advisors, advises them of its obligations with respect to the Confidential Information); (b) not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, without Discloser’s prior written consent; (c) use such Confidential Information only to the extent required to accomplish the Purpose; (d) not reproduce Confidential Information in any form except as required to accomplish the Purpose; (e) not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any software disclosed by the Discloser; (f) not directly or indirectly export or transmit any Confidential Information to any country to which such export or transmission is restricted by regulation or statute; and (g) promptly provide the Discloser with notice of any actual or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement. However, Recipient may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order provided that Recipient shall give Discloser written notice prior to such disclosure. Subject to Recipient’s obligations of non-disclosure, Recipient shall be free to use the residuals resulting from the use or access to the Confidential Information of Discloser. The term “residuals” means information in intangible form which is retained in the unaided memory of persons who have had access to the Confidential Information, without reference to such information in tangible or fixed form. Solely with respect to non-technical Confidential Information, Recipient’s obligations under this Section 3 shall expire one (1) year from the date of disclosure of such non-technical Confidential Information.
4. Ownership and Return of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall remain the property of Discloser. All copies shall bear all proprietary markings contained on or in the originals. Upon the request of Discloser, Recipient shall, at Recipient’s option, either (a) return such materials to Discloser, or (b) certify the destruction thereof.
5. Rights. No rights or licenses to trademarks, inventions, copyrights, patents or any other intellectual property rights are implied or granted under this Agreement. Subject to the obligations of this Agreement, neither party will be precluded from independently developing technology or pursuing business opportunities similar to those covered by the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. Each party retains sole discretion to assign or reassign the job responsibilities of its employees. Each party acknowledges that the other party may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from third parties, that is similar to the Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit Recipient from developing or having developed for it products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to those contemplated by or embodied in the Confidential Information, provided the Recipient does not violate its obligations under this Agreement.
6. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for a period of three (3) years unless terminated sooner as set forth below. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days written notice, provided however, that Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, and 7 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
7. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. This Agreement contains the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties relative to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating to its subject matter and may not be changed, modified, amended or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that no remedy at law will afford Discloser adequate protection against, or appropriate compensation for, breach of Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Discloser shall be entitled to specific performance of Recipient’s obligations, as well as such further equitable relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Confidentiality Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In connection with your consideration of a possible transaction involving Monster Worldwide, Inc. (the “Company”) (a “Transaction”), you have requested information. In consideration of, and as a condition to, your being furnished with such information and any other Evaluation Material (as defined below), the Company hereby requests your agreement as set forth herein.
As used in this letter agreement (this “Agreement”), the term “Evaluation Material” means all information regarding the Company, its affiliates and its and their respective businesses, technology, products, prospects and plans, a Transaction (including the fact that the Company or its affiliates may pursue a Transaction with you and the existence and terms of this Agreement) and other information furnished to you or your Representatives (as defined below) by the Company or any of its Representatives in connection with the Transaction, irrespective of form or medium of communication, whether prepared by the Company, its Representatives or otherwise and whether furnished on or after the date of this Agreement, together with all tangible and intangible embodiments and copies thereof and together with any and all analyses, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other materials prepared by you or your Representatives that contain, are based on or otherwise incorporate, in whole or part, such information. The term “Representatives” means, as to any person, such person’s affiliates (only to the extent that they receive Evaluation Material) and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, managing members, general partners, advisors, agents or representatives (including legal advisors) and, subject to paragraph 5 below, financing sources, but only to the extent that such advisors, agents, representatives or financing sources receive Evaluation Material.
Use and Confidentiality of Evaluation Materials
1. You and your Representatives will (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company involving you and (ii) keep the Evaluation Material strictly confidential and (except as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process, and only after compliance with paragraph 6 below under the heading “Compelled Disclosure”) will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, disclose any Evaluation Material to any person, except that the Evaluation Material (or portions thereof) may be disclosed to those of your Representatives who need to know such information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction (it being understood that prior to such disclosure your Representatives will be informed of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Material and directed that such information is to be kept confidential and not used for any purpose other than the evaluation of the possible Transaction). You will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to safeguard Evaluation Material from disclosure by you or your Representatives to anyone other than as permitted hereby by using, in all material respects, the same degree of care that you use to protect your own confidential, proprietary information. You agree to be responsible for any failure by your Representatives to comply with this Agreement (including, without limitation, any actions or inactions by your Representatives that would constitute a breach if such Representatives were original signatories hereto (other than with respect to paragraph 7 below under the heading “Non-Solicitation and Non-Hire of Employees”)).
2. The term “Evaluation Material” does not include any information which (i) is, as of the applicable time, generally known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure directly or indirectly by you or your Representatives), (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a person (other than the Company or its Representatives) who, to your knowledge, is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or its Representatives or prohibited from transmitting the information to you by law, contractual obligation, fiduciary duty or otherwise or (iii) was or is developed or discovered independently by you without reference to the Evaluation Material. As used in this Agreement, the term “person” will be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, joint venture, partnership, association or individual. You agree that the Evaluation Material owned by the Company or its affiliates in the first instance is and will remain the property of the Company or its affiliates, as applicable, and that neither the Company nor any of its affiliates or Representatives has granted you any license, copyright, or similar right with respect to any of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you by or on behalf of the Company.
Non-Disclosure of Transaction Discussions
3. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or legal process or stock exchange rule or regulation, but only after compliance with paragraph 6 below under the heading “Compelled Disclosure,” neither the Company nor its Representatives will, without your prior written consent, disclose to any other person that investigations, discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including, without limitation, the status thereof, the existence and terms of this Agreement and the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available to you. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company hereby expressly confirms and agrees that, to its knowledge, no public disclosure with respect to any discussions or negotiations concerning a possible Transaction is required by the Company at the time of the execution of this Agreement by reason of securities laws or similar requirements related to general disclosure.
4. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or legal process or stock exchange rule or regulation, but only after compliance with paragraph 6 below under the heading “Compelled Disclosure,” neither you nor your Representatives will, without the Company’s prior written consent, disclose to any other person either the fact that the Company or its affiliates may pursue a Transaction with you or anyone else, that investigations, discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including, without limitation, the status thereof, the existence and terms of this Agreement and the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available to you. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby expressly confirm and agree that, to your knowledge, no public disclosure with respect to any discussions or negotiations concerning a possible Transaction is required by you at the time of the execution of this Agreement by reason of securities laws or similar requirements related to general disclosure.
Financing Sources
5. Without limiting anything in this Agreement, your “Representatives” will include your potential debt financing sources in connection with a possible Transaction; provided, however, that, prior to providing Evaluation Material to any potential debt financing source (subject to and in accordance with paragraph 1 above), you will notify the Company of the identity of such debt financing source. Without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, engage in discussions regarding equity financing of a possible Transaction with any person, or otherwise engage in any discussions regarding a possible Transaction or enter into in any agreement, arrangement or understanding (or any discussions which might lead to an agreement, arrangement or understanding) with any person regarding participation in a possible Transaction as a principal, co-investor or source of equity financing. For the avoidance of doubt, except as agreed in writing by the Company, the term “Representatives” as applied to you will not include any such potential principal, co-investor or source of equity financing. You hereby represent and warrant that neither you nor any of your Representatives is party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether written or oral) that would restrict the ability of any other person to provide financing (debt, equity or otherwise) to any other person for the Transaction or any similar transaction, and you hereby agree that neither you nor any of your Representatives will directly or indirectly restrict the ability of any other person to provide any such financing.

Non-Solicitation and Non-Hire of Employees
7. Until the date that is eighteen (18) months from the date of this Agreement, you will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire or engage as a consultant, entice away or offer to enter into any contract with, or hire or engage as a consultant or enter into any contract with, during the period of employment or the 90-day period following such employment, any senior or key employee of the Company or its controlled affiliates who becomes known to you in connection with your evaluation of the Transaction; provided, however, that this paragraph will not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from engaging in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to any employees or former employees of the Company or its controlled affiliates, or from hiring any employees or former employees of the Company who respond to such solicitation. Finally, this paragraph 7 will not apply to any solicitation in the ordinary course of business initiated by one of your employees who has no knowledge of this Agreement or a potential Transaction, so long as such individual is acting without information or encouragement from any of your Representatives who does possess such knowledge.

Return or Destruction of Documents
10. If you determine that you do not wish to proceed with a Transaction or your evaluation hereof, you will promptly advise the Company of that decision.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company, all (i) communications regarding any possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information or Evaluation Material, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures relating to a possible Transaction, will be submitted or directed to only the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, the chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Company or those officers of the Company designated to you in writing by the Company. You further agree that, except as permitted by this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, you and your Representatives will not contact any other officers, directors, employees, stockholders, customers or suppliers of the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with a possible Transaction, and, without limiting anything in this Agreement, will not otherwise disclose to any such parties the fact that the Company or its affiliates may pursue a Transaction with you or other parties or that discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction.

Export Restrictions

You will not, and will cause your Representatives not to, without the express written permission of the Company, transmit, directly or indirectly, any Evaluation Material that is subject to such export restrictions to any person or country outside the United States or otherwise in violation of applicable law; provided, however, that you will not be deemed to be in violation of this provision in connection with any Evaluation Material provided directly by the Company or its Representatives to your employees who have a Randstad email address other than one ending in “randstadusa.com”. The Company will advise you in writing as to the applicability of this Section 13 to any particular piece of Evaluation Material at or before the time such material is provided to you.
No Obligation, Representation or Warranty
14. This Agreement defines the duties and obligations of you and your Representatives with respect to the Evaluation Material to the extent it may be disclosed or made available but does not constitute or create any obligation of the Company or its Representatives to provide any Evaluation Material or other information to you. Under no circumstances will the Company or any of its Representatives be obligated to disclose or make available any information, including, without limitation, any Evaluation Material, which the Company in its sole and absolute discretion determines not to disclose. Except for any express representations and warranties set forth in a definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement, you understand and acknowledge that none of the Company or any of their respective Representatives is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you or your Representatives by or on behalf of the Company, and none of the Company or any of their respective Representatives will have any liability to you or any other person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) resulting from your use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, except as may otherwise be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.
15. You acknowledge and agree that neither you nor the Company, nor any of either party’s Representatives, will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Transaction by virtue of (i) this Agreement or (ii) any written or oral expression or communication with respect to any Transaction by any of the Company’s Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. You further acknowledge and agree that (a) the Company will be free to conduct the process for a Transaction as the Company in its sole discretion will determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other person and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to you or any other person), (b) none of you, the Company, or any of your or their respective Representatives will have any legal, fiduciary or other duty to the other party or its Representatives with respect to any such process, and none of you, the Company, or each party’s respective Representatives are relying on any express or implied representation concerning the manner in which such process will proceed, (c) any of the procedures relating to a Transaction may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person, (d) each party will have the right to reject or accept any potential proposal, offer or participant therein, for any or no reason whatsoever, in its sole discretion and (e) neither party will have any claim whatsoever against the other or any of their respective Representatives arising out of or relating to a Transaction, except as may otherwise be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.

negotiations, agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether written or oral) with any other person regarding the Transaction, other than the Company and its Representatives, and your Representatives (to the extent permitted hereunder).
Legal Remedy
18. You acknowledge that money damages and remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Company against any actual or threatened breach of or failure to comply with this Agreement by you or by your Representatives and, without prejudice to any rights and remedies otherwise available to the Company, you may agree to the seeking of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in the Company’s favor, and you further agree to waive, and to cause your Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy.

20. No failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.
Successors and Assigns
21. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. You may not assign this Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the Company, and any purported assignment without such consent will be null and void.

22. If it is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction (not subject to further appeal) that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, (i) the remaining terms and provision hereof will be unimpaired and will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and (ii) the invalid or unenforceable term or provision will be replaced by a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the parties’ intention with respect to such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

WHEREAS, as a result of employment with Heritage up to the Effective Time and with the Bank thereafter, Employee had, has and will have access to Confidential Information (as defined below) and may have acquired or will acquire knowledge regarding Confidential Information, including, but not limited to, information regarding Customers or Potential Customers (as defined below), and a Banking Organization could be harmed if such Confidential Information were to be used, divulged or become known to any competitor of a Banking Organization or to any other Person (as defined below) or to any entity outside of a Banking Organization;
WHEREAS, Employee has developed or may develop contacts and business relationships with Customers or Potential Customers which could be used to the detriment of a Banking Organization and/or to solicit employees away from a Banking Organization; and

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties incorporate the above recitals, and in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and agreements made herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
1. Consideration/Employment.
a. This Agreement neither constitutes an employment contract or agreement to Employee for a stated period of time, nor does it alter Employee’s existing employment status.
b. In consideration of Employee’s promises, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, (i) as of the date of this Agreement and up to the Effective Time Heritage shall maintain Employee’s employment with the compensation and benefits commensurate therewith, and (ii) effective as of the Effective Time, the Bank shall offer or maintain Employee’s employment pursuant to that certain Employment Agreement dated January 7, 2019, and effective as of the Effective Time, with the compensation and benefits commensurate therewith.
2. Duties. Employee shall devote his/her full working time and attention to the performance of those services for the Banking Organization which are assigned to him/her from time to time and to perform such services in a faithful, honest and diligent manner and in the best interest of such Banking Organization.
3. Definitions of Key Terms.
a. “Banking and Financial Services” shall mean those banking and related financial services of a Banking Organization or subsidiary thereof, including but not limited to, checking and savings accounts, health savings accounts, money market accounts, loans, credit cards, cash management services, lines of credit, investment services (such as IRAs, college savings plans, estate planning, investment planning, business planning), and trust services, provided during any period in which Employee served or will serve in any capacity for a Financial Institution and all banking and related financial services substantially similar to such banking and related financial services.
b. “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all materials, records, data, documents, lists, writings, and information (whether in writing, printed, electronically stored, computerized, on disk or otherwise, including, but not limited to, all copies, summaries, analyses, drafts, and extracts) relating or referring in any manner to trade secrets (as currently defined under applicable law, including, but not limited to, the Indiana Uniform Trade Secrets Act and any amendments or successor statutes) of a Banking Organization, as well as other non-public financial or proprietary information of a Banking Organization including, but not limited to, business reports, business plans, projections, income statements, profit and loss statements, business strategies and/or strategic plans, internal audits, sales information, sales techniques, business costs, product pricing, budgets, research and development, intellectual property, software and/or computer programs, marketing strategies or ideas, marketing plans or materials, business development plans or strategies, records or information relating to customers or account holders , customer lists, inventions, and processes, systems, methods, documentation or devices which are unique or proprietary to the business of or services or products of a Banking Organization. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes readily or publicly available, not as a result of a violation of this Agreement or other obligation of confidence, directly or indirectly, of the disclosing party; (ii) is developed by other parties, including, but not limited to, subsequent employers of the Employee, independent of the knowledge or resources of the Employee based upon his or her prior access to a Banking Organization’s Confidential Information; (iii) is independently developed after the Employee’s termination of employment without reference to or use of the Confidential Information or materials based thereon; (iv) is based on the Employee’s personal experience, knowledge, enterprise and expertise in the delivery of Banking and Financial Services and which is general knowledge concerning the industry, not specific to a Banking Organization; or (v) is disclosed pursuant to the requirements of a court, administrative agency or other governmental agency.
c. “Customers” or “Customer” shall mean any Person to whom a Banking Organization rendered or provided Banking and Financial Services at any time during the one-year period prior to Employee’s termination of employment with a Financial Institution: (i) with whom Employee had any material contact (either directly or indirectly); (ii) which Employee managed, had responsibility for or regularly serviced while employed by the Financial Institution, provided, however, this shall not be construed to include supervising those who have such a relationship to the Customer; or, (iii) about which Employee obtained Confidential Information.
d. “Employees,” “Agents,” and “Independent Contractors” shall mean any and all persons employed or contracted by a Banking Organization or who were employed or contracted by a Banking Organization, as an employee, agent or independent contractor, within the six (6) month period prior to Employee’s termination of employment with either Financial Institution.
e. “Person” shall mean any individual, partnership, corporation, organization, bank, credit union, firm, association, limited liability company, trust, joint venture, company or other entity, body, agency or department thereof.
f. “Potential Customer” shall mean any Person that Employee directly solicited, targeted or specifically identified as a prospective or potential customer, or about which Employee obtained information on behalf of a Banking Organization for purposes of directly soliciting, targeting or specifically identifying as a prospective or potential customer, during the one (1) year period prior to Employee’s termination of employment with either Financial Institution.
g. “Solicit”, “Solicited” or “Solicitation” means any direct or indirect communication of any kind whatsoever, regardless of by whom initiated, inviting, advising, inducing, encouraging, enticing, or requesting either expressly or implicitly, any Person, in any manner, to take or refrain from taking action, provided, however, this definition does not include communications initiated by Customers or Potential Customers of their own initiative, without prompting or encouragement by Employee or anyone acting on Employee’s behalf.
4. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. During the course of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution, Employee agrees that Employee has or will continue to become knowledgeable about, or come to be in possession of, Confidential Information. If such Confidential Information were to be divulged or become known to any competitor of a Banking Organization, or to any other Person outside of a Banking Organization, or if Employee were to consent to be employed by any competitor of a Banking Organization, or to engage in competition with a Banking Organization, such Banking Organization will be harmed. In addition, Employee has or may develop relationships with Customers or Potential Customers so that the Confidential Information could be used to Solicit the business of such Customer or Potential Customer away from a Banking Organization.
Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the benefit of a Banking Organization, and shall not directly or indirectly, disclose, communicate, deliver, exhibit or provide any Confidential Information to any Person, except other Employees or Agents of a Banking Organization who have a need to know such Confidential Information for a proper corporate or business purpose, as required in the normal course of Employee’s service as an employee. Nothing in this Section 4, or any other provision of this Agreement, shall be construed to prohibit Employee from reporting conduct to, providing truthful information to, or participating in any investigation or proceeding brought or conducted by any federal or state government agency or self-regulatory organization.
Employee specifically acknowledges that the Confidential Information, whether reduced to writing or maintained electronically or in the mind or memory of Employee and, whether compiled by a Banking Organization and/or the Employee, derives independent economic value from not being readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, that reasonable efforts have been put forth by each Banking Organization to maintain the secrecy of such information, that such information is the sole property of such Banking Organization and that any retention and/or use of such information during or after Employee’s employment with either Financial Institution (except in the course of performing the Employee’s duties of employment with a Financial Institution and except as otherwise set forth above) constitutes a misappropriation of a Banking Organization’s Confidential Information.
Employee agrees that all Confidential Information and all records, documents and materials relating to all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of a Banking Organization, and upon Employee’s termination of employment, all such Confidential Information, whether in paper or electronic form, shall be returned to a Financial Institution in good condition, without Employee retaining a copy thereof, including, but not limited to, retaining an electronic copy on any electronic device regardless of whether such device is owned by Employee. At a Financial Institution’s request, Employee shall provide written verification, under the penalties for perjury, of his/her compliance with this covenant.
5. Non-Solicitation of Customers and Potential Customers. Employee acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of Employee’s position with a Banking Organization, Employee has or will have advantageous familiarity and personal contacts with Customers and Potential Customers and will have advantageous familiarity with the business operations and affairs of a Banking Organization. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been or will be placed in a position that, were Employee to leave a Financial Institution to compete with the business of a Banking Organization, such entity from which the Employee departed would, upon violation of this Agreement, suffer irreparable harm and financial loss, as well as lost goodwill and Confidential Information. Therefore, in consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution (“Restriction Period”), for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee’s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee’s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:
a. Solicit, divert, or take away (or attempt to Solicit, divert or take away) any Banking and Financial Services to or from any Customer or Potential Customer; or
b. advise, persuade or induce (or attempt to advise, persuade or induce) any Customer or Potential Customer to terminate, reduce, limit, or change the Customer’s services or business relationship, or the Potential Customer’s contemplated services or business relationship, with a Financial Institution; or
c. directly provide Banking and Financial Services to, or directly accept Banking and Financial Services from, any Customer or Potential Customer.
This Agreement is not intended to prevent Employee from accepting employment with an organization that competes with the Banking Organizations by offering Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers. The Parties acknowledge that Employee may be associated with such an Organization and that such association may place Employee in a senior or supervisory role to those in the organization that have contact with Customers or Potential Customers. Employee shall not be in violation of this Agreement merely by engaging in such a role, which may include:
a. supervising those who provide Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers;
b. engaging in credit review, underwriting, loan approval, or financial analysis of a Customer or Potential Customer’s business as a part of a supervisory or management role, so long as such activity does not require the disclosure of Confidential Information, direct contact with the Customer or Potential Customer, or the disclosure of Employee’s role to the Customer or Potential Customer;
c. performing or supervising those that perform data processing, accounting, rate review, document review or similar “back room” services related to a Customer or Potential Customer so long as the services do not require the disclosure of Confidential Information or contact with the Customer or Potential Customer.
6. Non-Solicitation of Employees and Others. In consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee’s employment with a
Financial Institution, and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution, for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee’s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee’s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:
c. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Employee to terminate his or her employment with a Banking Organization, or offer or provide employment (whether such employment is with Employee or any other Person) either on a full-time or part-time, consulting or Independent Contractor basis; or
d. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Independent Contractors or Agents to terminate their contract or relationship with a Banking Organization or discontinue providing services to a Banking Organization and/or Customers; or
e. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any suppliers, vendors or others who were supplying services or goods to a Banking Organization during the one year period prior to Employee’s termination, to terminate, reduce, limit or change their business or relationship with a Banking Organization.
7. Tolling of Covenants. Employee acknowledges that a Banking Organization is entitled to the full post-termination restrictions on the activities set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as applicable. Therefore, in the event any of the provisions of these Sections are breached by Employee, the commencement of the applicable post-termination restriction will not begin until Employee is in full compliance with Section 5 and/or 6.
8. Severability/Blue Pencil. Each of the provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenants in Sections 5 and 6, are distinct and severable, notwithstanding that the covenants may be set forth in one section for convenience. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, for any reason, neither the validity of the remaining part of such provision nor the validity of any other provision of this Agreement shall in any way be affected. Should any particular restrictive covenant, provision or clause of this Agreement be held unreasonable or unenforceable for any reason, including without limitation, the time period, geographic area and/or scope of activity covered by such covenant, provision or clause, the parties acknowledge and agree that such covenant, provision or clause shall be given effect and enforce to whatever extent would be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law. The parties expressly authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to modify or revise such provision to limit the covenants to cover the maximum period of time, range of activities or other restrictions as would be enforceable under Indiana law.
9. Available Relief. Employee agrees that a Banking Organization, or its successor or assigns, will suffer irreparable damage and injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of any breach by Employee of any provision of Sections 4, 5 or 6, herein. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or of a threatened or attempted breach by Employee of Sections 4, 5, or 6, in addition to all other remedies to which a Banking Organization is entitled under law, in equity, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, monetary damages), a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary or permanent injunction (without the necessity of showing any actual damage) or a decree of specific performance and no bond or other security shall be required in that connection.
10. Enforcement/Attorneys’ Fees. In any action that is brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys’ and paralegal fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. If a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, institute any action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, Employee hereby waives all claims or defenses that a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, have an adequate remedy at law, and Employee shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.
11. Assignments; Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of Employee hereunder are not assignable or delegable by Employee, and any prohibited assignment or delegation will be null and void. The Banking Organization may, without the consent of the Employee, assign this Agreement to any successor or in connection with any merger, consolidation, share exchange, combination, sale of stock or assets or similar transaction. The provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of a Banking Organization.
12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under, subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, without consideration of the choice of law principles thereof, and all questions concerning its validity, construction and administration shall be determined in accordance with Indiana law.
13. Entire Agreement/Modification/Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and expressly supersedes any prior agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be terminated, amended or modified without the prior written consent of the Bank’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Employee. No failure or delay by a Banking Organization in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement operate or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach or noncompliance hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by a Banking Organization shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Bank’s President and Chief Executive Officer. A waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and will not constitute a waiver for the future or act on anything other than that which is specifically waived.
14. “No-Defense” Provision. The covenants set forth in this Agreement are essential terms and conditions to a Banking Organization employing or continuing to employ Employee, and shall be construed as independent of any other obligations or agreements between Employee and a Banking Organization. The existence of any claim or cause of action Employee may have against a Banking Organization, including, but not limited to, the alleged material breach by a Banking Organization of any agreement with Employee, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by a Banking Organization of the covenants and obligations in this Agreement and shall not relieve Employee of his or her obligations under this Agreement.
15. Jurisdiction and Venue. The parties agree that all suits, actions, proceedings, litigation, disputes, or claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be filed and tried in the Superior or Circuit Court, as appropriate, of Vigo County, Indiana, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Terre Haute Division. In this regard, the parties hereby: (a) agree that venue shall be such stated courts; (b) irrevocably consent to service of process and to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts; and (c) irrevocably waive any claim of inconvenient forum if any such suit, claim, proceeding, litigation, dispute, or claim has been filed, brought, or made in any of such courts.
16. Construction. This Agreement is the result of negotiations between the parties, and no party shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement; accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed without any presumption or inference based upon or against the party causing this Agreement to be prepared. The language of this Agreement shall in all cases be construed as a whole, according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.
17. Review and Consultation. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he/she has read this Agreement in its entirety prior to executing it, understands the provisions and effects of this Agreement, and has consulted with or had the opportunity to consult with an attorney or other advisers as he/she deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement.
18. Section Headings. Section headings are inserted into this Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect any construction or interpretation of this Agreement.
19. Reasonableness. Employee agrees and acknowledges that the covenants, restrictions and obligations set forth in this Agreement, including Sections 5 and 6, are reasonable and necessary to protect a Banking Organization. Employee agrees that the covenants, restrictions and obligations will not affect Employee’s ability to make a living.
20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed a duplicate original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties agree that signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic means are acceptable the same as original signatures for the execution of the Agreement.
21. Miscellaneous. Any change in Employee’s duties, responsibilities, title, position, compensation, or status, with a Financial Institution will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.
22. Representations. Employee represents and warrants that he/she is not a party to an agreement with his or her prior employer(s) (other than Heritage or HopFed) or any other Person that prohibits Solicitation of business or competing with that employer or other Person. Employee affirms and represents that performance of his/her job duties and responsibilities for a Financial Institution does not, and will not, breach any agreement or covenant not to Solicit business, compete in business, or keep in confidence proprietary or confidential information acquired in confidence or in trust prior to Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution. Employee further represents that he/she has not retained any documents or information relating to Employee’s prior employers (other than Heritage or HopFed) that may be considered confidential or proprietary information and that Employee has not disclosed or used, and will not disclose or use, any information relating to his or her prior employer(s) in connection with Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution.
23. Return of Property. Upon termination of Employee’s employment, Employee shall immediately return to the Bank (if subsequent to the Effective Time) or Heritage (if prior to the Effective Time), all Banking Organizations documents and property, including, but not limited to, Confidential Information, computer discs, manuals, reports, files, memoranda, records, door and file keys, passwords and access codes, and any other physical or tangible things that Employee received, prepared, or helped prepare in connection with the Employee’s employment, and Employee shall not retain any copies, duplicates, reproductions or excerpts thereof. At the Bank’s or Heritage’s request, Employee shall provide written verification under the penalties for perjury of his/her compliance with this covenant.
24. Survival. Except as set forth below, the covenants in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 23 shall survive the termination of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution regardless of the reason for termination. If the Merger is not consummated and the Merger Agreement is terminated, Sections 4, 5, 6 and 23 shall survive with respect to First Financial and the Bank, but shall not survive with respect to HopFed or Heritage.

CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality & Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into as of May 1, 2013 (“Effective Date”), by and between Verenium Corporation, a Delaware corporation located at 3550 John Hopkins Court, San Diego, CA 92121 (“Verenium”), and BASF Corporation, a Delaware corporation with a principal address at 100 Campus Drive, Florham Park, New Jersey 07932 (for notice purposes, Attention: General Counsel) (including its Affiliates, “Company”), individually known as a “Party” and collectively known as the “Parties”.
Verenium intends to disclose to Company certain of its Confidential Information as Verenium deems necessary in order for the Company to evaluate a potential transaction of mutual interest (the “Purpose”). In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:
1. “Confidential Information” shall mean the Purpose (including the contemplated transaction), identity of, and any discussions or negotiations between, the Parties, existence of this Agreement, and any and all information whether in oral, written, graphic or electronic form, including but not limited to, data, know-how and any and all subject matter (whether patentable or not, including without limitation any derivatives thereof) pertaining to Verenium’s research, financial data, sales information, inventions, development, materials, technology, trade secrets, work in process, marketing, business plans, regulatory information and strategies, scientific, engineering and/or manufacturing processes or equipment, protocols, assays, strains, compounds, genes, gene pathways, enzymes, peptides, the commercial applications of genes, gene pathways, enzymes, peptides, accessing microbial diversity, manipulating and modifying genes and gene pathways, identifying bioactive compounds through recombinant techniques and any other elements of Verenium’s business which Verenium considers to be of value, including its present or future products, projections, sales, pricing, customers, employees, investors and contractual relationships.
2. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Agreement, (i) Company, as recipient of Confidential Information from or on behalf of Verenium, shall use such Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and for no other purpose or use, and (ii) Company shall not disclose to any third party any Confidential Information received from or on behalf of Verenium hereunder. Upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, Company shall immediately notify Verenium.
3. Company agrees to treat Confidential Information received from or on behalf of Verenium, with at least the same degree of care that Company uses to protect its own Confidential Information. Company shall only disseminate Confidential Information to such of its Representatives with a special need to know for carrying out the Purpose of this Agreement. In addition, Company hereby agrees that such Representatives shall be informed of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information received and that such Representatives shall be bound by the terms hereof or subject to confidentiality and non-use obligations no less restrictive than those set forth herein. Company shall be liable for any disclosure or use of the Confidential Information by its Representatives in a manner not authorized by this Agreement. “Representative” means any employee, consultant, contractor, officer, agent, advisor, and/or director of a Party. “Affiliate” for purposes of this Agreement shall mean any one or more business entities which are: (a) owned or controlled by, (b) owning or controlling, or (c) under common control with a Party at the time in question. Ownership, direct or indirect, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock or other equity interests of an entity ordinarily entitled to vote in the election of directors or similar governing body of an entity shall, without limitation, constitute ownership or control thereof.
4. The Company shall have no obligations to Verenium with respect to the use of such information, or disclosure to others not party to this Agreement, of such information which: (a) prior to disclosure was rightfully known to or in the possession of Company as evidenced by Company’s competent written records and not subject to any confidentiality or non-disclosure obligations or restrictions; (b) is or becomes publicly known during the time period in which Company’s duties and obligations hereunder extend, through no fault, unauthorized act or omission of Company or its Representatives; (c) was provided without restriction on disclosure by a third party who had the lawful right to make such disclosure and where such disclosure was not in violation of any obligation, contractual or otherwise, owed by such third party to Verenium; (d) is rightfully and in good faith developed by Company independently of any disclosures made under this Agreement, as evidenced by Company’s competent written records; or (e) is required by applicable law, regulation or bona fide legal process to be disclosed by Company, provided, however, that Company takes all reasonable steps to restrict and maintain the confidentiality of such disclosure (including, without limitation, seeking a protective order or confidential treatment thereof, as the case may be), and provides reasonable prior written notice to Verenium of the requirement to disclose such information and the specific disclosure(s) proposed to satisfy such law(s), regulation(s) or legal process(es).
5. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced by Company in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information by Company shall remain the property of Verenium unless otherwise authorized in writing by Verenium.
6. Company agrees, upon request, to promptly return or destroy all items relating to Confidential Information, including but not limited to, all materials, written materials, drawings, data and records provided or otherwise made available by Verenium, and all copies (in any form) thereof, with a certificate of compliance with the foregoing, executed by an appropriate officer of Company within 30 days of such request, provided that the Company may maintain a single copy of such Confidential Information within its Legal Department for archival purposes. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Confidential Information, Company and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by the obligations hereof.
7. All right, title and interest in and to Confidential Information shall be retained by Verenium and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any license or right under any patent or other intellectual property rights, or other rights, or representing any commitment by either Party to enter into any additional agreement, by implication or otherwise, or creating any partnership, joint venture or agency relationship. All Confidential Information provided hereunder is provided “AS IS” and without any warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance. Verenium shall have no liability to Company of any nature or kind whatsoever, directly or indirectly, resulting from or arising out of the reliance or use by Company of any Confidential Information.
8. Company acknowledges that it is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the Purpose or who review Confidential Information, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of Verenium’s securities by any person who has received material, non-public information about Verenium and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
9. During the one-year period commencing on the date of this Agreement (the “Standstill Period”), neither the Company nor any of its Representatives will, in any manner, directly or indirectly (except to the extent agreed by Verenium): (a) make, effect, initiate, cause or participate in (i) any acquisition of beneficial ownership of any securities of Verenium or any securities of any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, in excess of five (5) percent of the outstanding securities of any such company (with any such acquisition, regardless of size, only being made at such time as neither the acquiring party nor any of its Affiliates is in possession of material, non-public information about Verenium), (ii) any acquisition of any assets of Verenium or any assets of any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or extraordinary transaction involving Verenium or any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, or involving any securities or assets of Verenium or any securities or assets of any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium, or (iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents with respect to any securities of Verenium; (b) form, join or participate in a “group” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder) with respect to the beneficial ownership of any securities of Verenium; (c) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of Verenium; (d) take any action that might require Verenium to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause “(a)” of this sentence; (e) agree or offer to take, or encourage or propose (publicly or otherwise) the taking of, any action referred to in clause “(a)”, “(b)”, “(c)” or “(d)” of this sentence; (f) assist, induce or encourage any other person or entity to take any action of the type referred to in clause “(a)”, “(b)”, “(c)”, “(d)” or “(e)” of this sentence; or (g) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangement or agreement with any other person or entity relating to any of the foregoing. The expiration of the Standstill Period will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company and its Representatives shall not be precluded from submitting a topping or other offer or otherwise participating in any process not initiated by the Company or its Affiliates or Representatives in which the securities or assets of Verenium or any subsidiary or other Affiliate of Verenium are for sale or are being or have been sold, and (ii) upon filing for protection under US Bankruptcy laws by Verenium or any subsidiary or Affiliate of Verenium the restrictions of this paragraph 9 shall be void and of no further force or effect with respect to the filing entity.
10. This Agreement shall constitute the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be modified only in writing and signed by both Parties; provided, however, that any restrictions set forth on the Company or its Affiliates in any previous confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements between the Parties or their Affiliates shall remain in place for the periods set forth in any such agreements. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement, and rights and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, personal representatives, executors and administrators.
11. Company acknowledges that its breach of this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to Verenium and hereby agrees that Verenium shall be entitled to injunctive relief under this Agreement for such breach or threatened breach as well as such further relief as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.
12. This Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date and shall terminate one (1) year thereafter, unless earlier terminated upon 30 days written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that the duties set forth in paragraphs 9 and 13 shall survive for the periods set forth in paragraphs 9 and 13 and the Company’s duties and obligations to protect Confidential Information disclosed during the term (or any extension) of this Agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company’s duties and obligations to protect a trade secret disclosed hereunder shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely.
13. During the one-year period commencing on the date of this Agreement (the “Non-Solicitation Period”), Company shall not, nor shall it permit its Affiliates or Representatives, to: (a) hire any employee of Verenium or enter into a contract with any employee of Verenium to provide services to Company (or any of its Affiliates), in each case involving an employee of Verenium with whom Company has contact as a result of this Agreement or discussions relating to a possible transaction between the Parties, without obtaining the prior written approval of Verenium, or (b) directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce or otherwise solicit, counsel, discuss, advise or encourage any such employee to leave or otherwise terminate such employee’s relationship with Verenium; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 13 shall not apply to any employee of Verenium who was previously terminated by Verenium or who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement regarding employment with Company or its Affiliates. The expiration of the Non-Solicitation Period will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement.
14. All notices or reports permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered by personal delivery, electronic mail, facsimile transmission or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed given upon personal delivery, five (5) days after deposit in the mail, or upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic or facsimile transmission. Notices shall be sent to the addresses set forth at the beginning of this Agreement or such other address as a Party may specify in writing to the other Party. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the authority to undertake the obligations set forth in this Agreement without breaching or violating any contractual or statutory obligation owed to another. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between Actuate Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business located at 951 Mariners Island Boulevard, San Mateo, CA 94404 (“Actuate”), and Open Text Corporation, a corporation incorporated pursuant to the laws of Canada, with its principal place of business located at 275 Frank Tompa Drive, Waterloo, ON N2L OA1 (“Company”). Actuate and Company intend to discuss a potential business relationship.
Each undersigned party (the “Receiving Party”) and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or advisors (including, without limitation, legal advisors, accountants, consultants, bankers, and financial advisors) and potential sources of financing (collectively, “Representatives”) understands that during these discussions the other party (the “Disclosing Party’’) may disclose Proprietary Information (as defined herein) relating to the Disclosing Party’s business.
In consideration of the parties’ discussions and any access the Receiving Party may have to Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party hereby agrees as follows:
1. As used herein, the term “Proprietary Information” refers to any and all Information of a confidential, proprietary, or secret nature which is applicable to or related In any way to (i) the business, present or future, of the Disclosing Party, (ii) the research and development or investigations of the Disclosing Party or (iii) the business of any customer of the Disclosing Party; provided, in each case, that such information is delivered to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party and (a) is marked or identified in writing as “Confidential”, (b) if verbal or visual disclosure, is identified as “Confidential” in a writing within ten (10) business days of such disclosure, or (c) is information that the Receiving Party actually knew or reasonably should have known was confidential. Proprietary Information may include, for example and without limitation, the product offering, content partners, product pricing, product availability, computer programs, technical drawings, algorithms, processes, ideas, schematics, trade secrets, processes, formulas, data, know-how, improvements, inventions (whether patentable or not), techniques, marketing plans, forecasts and strategies, and information concerning customers or vendors. Proprietary Information shall also include all information of a like nature owned by any other person and furnished to the Disclosing Party by such other person pursuant to an undertaking by the Disclosing Party to maintain the same in confidence.
2. The Receiving Party agrees (a) to hold the Disclosing Party’s Proprietary Information In strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions that Receiving Party employs with respect to its confidential materials), (b) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person without prior written permission of the Disclosing Party, excluding disclosure to Representatives, (c) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into the contemplated business relationship with the Disclosing Party, and (d) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee given access to any such Proprietary Information must have a legitimate “need to know” and be subject to restrictions on disclosure of Proprietary Information practically identical to the terms set forth herein. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall not apply with respect to any information that (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes generally available to the public, or (ii) was or is rightfully in Receiving Party’s possession or the possession of any of its Representatives or was known by it or its Representatives without restriction prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (iii) was or is rightfully disclosed to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives by a third party provided the Receiving Party complies with restrictions imposed by the third party, or (iv) was or is independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party and its Representatives may make disclosures required by court order or any legal or judicial process, without any liability hereunder, provided the Receiving Party uses reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate In the proceeding to the extent legally permissible and reasonably practicable.
3. Promptly upon receipt of a written request by the Disclosing Party at any time (which will be effective if actually received or three days after mailed first class postage prepaid to the Receiving Party’s address herein), the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party, or, at its sole discretion, destroy and certify to the Receiving party in writing the destruction of all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof; provided, however, the Company and its Representatives shall not be obligated to return or destroy Proprietary Information to the extent otherwise required by law, regulation, rule or practice governing professionals or any internal compliance policy or procedure required by law, regulation rule of practice governing professionals. The Receiving Party understands that nothing requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any proposed transaction or relationship in connection with which Proprietary Information may be disclosed.
4. Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business relationship contemplated by this Agreement.
5. The parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the possible transaction between the parties, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any material breach of this Agreement, that any such breach may allow the breaching party or third parties to unfairly compete with the non-breaching party, resulting in irreparable harm to the non-breaching party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party In writing immediately upon the occurrence of any unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware.
6. The parties expressly agree that neither the terms or conditions of this Agreement, nor the discussions held by the parties to address the feasibility of a potential business relationship shall be construed as to prevent either party from pursuing similar discussions with third parties in similar markets or obligate either party to take, continue or forgo any action relating to the above-mentioned discussions. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting either party from independently developing, acquiring, and marketing products, services, and other materials, which are similar to or competitive In any geographic area and in any form with the other party’s product(s) or service(s). However, this paragraph shall not be deemed to grant to either party any license under the other party’s copyrights or patents.
7. During the one year period commencing on the date of this Agreement, the Company will not solicit or seek to employ any key employee or executive officer of Actuate or any subsidiary or other affiliate of Actuate with whom the Company had contact or became aware of in connection with the possible transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not prohibit the solicitation or employment of any such person (i) resulting from general advertisements for employment conducted by the Company (including any recruitment efforts conducted by any recruitment agency, provided that the Company has not directed such recruitment efforts at such person), (ii) if such person approaches the Company on an unsolicited basis or (iii) following the cessation of such person’s employment with Actuate without any solicitation or encouragement by the Company.
8. From the date of this Agreement until May 31 , 2015 (the “Standstill Period”) the Company will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly through any third party:
(a) make, effect, initiate, cause or participate in (i) any acquisition of beneficial ownership of any securities of Actuate or any securities of any subsidiary or other affiliate of Actuate, (ii) any acquisition of any assets of Actuate or any assets of any subsidiary or other affiliate of Actuate, (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger. business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or extraordinary transaction involving Actuate or any subsidiary or other affiliate of Actuate, or involving any securities or assets of Actuate or any securities or assets of any subsidiary or other affiliate of Actuate, or (iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents with respect to any securities of Actuate;
(b) form, join or participate in a “group” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder) with respect to the beneficial ownership of any securities of Actuate;
(c) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of Actuate;
(d) take any action that might require Actuate to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause “(a)” of this sentence;
(e) agree or offer to take, or encourage or propose (publicly or otherwise) the taking of, any action referred to in clause “(a) “, “(b)”, “(c)” or “(d)” of this sentence; or
(f) assist, induce or encourage any other individual and any corporation, partnership, entity, group, tribunal or governmental authority (“Person”) to take any action of the type referred to In clause “(a)”, “(b)”, “(c)”, “(d)” or “(e)” of this sentence.
(g) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangement or agreement with any other Person relating to any of the foregoing; or
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is permitted to purchase any securities that does not in any event result in an aggregate ownership by the Company of more than 5% of the outstanding amount of any class of securities of Actuate or of any subsidiary or other affiliate of Actuate. Further, and notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be prohibited from (i) making any proposal to the board of directors of Actuate, which would not reasonably be expected to require a public announcement by Actuate or (ii) requesting that Actuate, directly or indirectly, waive or amend any of the provisions of this Section 8. Finally, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Actuate acknowledges and agrees that any non-disclosure agreement it or its affiliates have entered into or will enter into with a Person to explore a potential transaction for the sale of more than 50% of the outstanding voting equity securities of Actuate, or a sale of substantially all of the assets of Actuate, has or will have “standstill” provisions similar or substantially similar to the provisions set forth above in this Section 8 applicable to the Company.
9. This Agreement shall expire and cease to have any force or effect on the earlier of (i) eighteen months from the date hereof or (ii) the date of consummation of a transaction between the parties.
10. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of California without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions and writings and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees. No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding upon either party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of such party and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year set forth below.

"ORACLE
CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FOR STRATEGIC MATTERS
This Confidential Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the effective date listed below (“Effective Date”) by Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) located at 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and the company designated below (“Company”).
Oracle and the Company are entering into discussions concerning a possible strategic transaction involving the Company and/or its shareholders (the “Transaction”). In connection with these discussions, the parties expect to make available to one another certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information, which may include information concerning their respective business prospects and plans, financial condition, technology, operations, assets and liabilities (collectively, the “Evaluation Material”). As a condition to each party furnishing the Evaluation Material to the other party and the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors of such party or its subsidiaries or other affiliates (collectively, “Representatives”), each party agrees that the Evaluation Material furnished to it hereunder shall be treated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
1. Evaluation Material. “Evaluation Material” also includes notes, studies analyses, compilations, plans, interpretations or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives to the extent that they contain or are based upon the Evaluation Material furnished to such party hereunder. The term “Evaluation Material” does not include information that (a) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge or is generally available to the public not through a breach of this Agreement; (b) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to such information; (c) is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without a duty of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Evaluation Material.
2. Non-Disclosure; Use. Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person (other than to such party’s Representatives who agree, or are otherwise bound, not to disclose the following except as contemplated by this Agreement) any of the other party’s Evaluation Material, the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, or any terms or other facts relating to the Transaction. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Evaluation Material shall only be used by a party and its Representatives to evaluate, negotiate, facilitate or pursue a Transaction.
3. Personally Identifiable Information. To the extent that its Evaluation Material includes human resources data and/or other information that serves to identify one or more individuals (“PII”), the disclosing party agrees to provide only such information as is required for evaluating or planning for a possible Transaction and to provide any notices and obtain any consents necessary for the receiving party to store and access such PII globally and to use PII in connection with the Transaction. The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any request received by the receiving party for access, correction, amendment or redaction of any PII. The disclosing party shall be responsible for compliance with all such requests. The receiving party also agrees to notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected improper acquisition of PII of which the receiving party becomes aware.
4. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of either party or any of its Representatives to use “residuals” relating to the Evaluation Material of the other party. The term “residuals” shall mean information of any kind included in or relating to the Evaluation Material which is retained in the memories of Representatives of either party who have had access to the Evaluation Material, including ideas, know-how, or techniques contained therein, but not as a result of any deliberate effort to memorize the information. Without limitation of the foregoing, neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its employees or to pay royalties to the other party in connection with any use of residuals.
5. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or preclude either party from developing, using, marketing, licensing, and/or selling any independently developed software, hardware, technology or other materials similar or related to the Evaluation Material.
6. Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that a party or its Representatives receives a request or is required (by law, rule, regulation, deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil demand or other process) to disclose any of the other party’s Evaluation Material or any of the other information referred to in section 2 hereof (irrespective of the reason for any such request or requirement), the party requested or required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent reasonable and practicable, provide the other party with prior written notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such order, remedy or waiver is not obtained, the party requested or required to make the disclosure may disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material or other information that such party, in the opinion of counsel, is required to disclose.
7. Return of Materials; Termination. Promptly upon written request from the other party, each party shall return or destroy (at the receiving party’s option) all copies of the Evaluation Material (including all documents based thereon) in its or its Representatives’ possession, provided, that the receiving party shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to return or destroy any Evaluation Material created pursuant to its or its Representatives’ standard electronic backup and archival procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party and each of its Representatives may each retain one copy of the Evaluation Material to show compliance with this Agreement or to comply with applicable law, rule or regulation (or, in the case of a party’s advisors, professional standards). Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality. This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that sections 4, 5 and 7 through 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
8. Definitive Agreements. Unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding the Transaction has been executed by the parties, no agreement with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties and neither party will be under any obligation whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any oral expression except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The term “definitive agreement” does not include a term sheet or any other preliminary written agreement. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not provide Evaluation Material under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.
9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement with respect to the Evaluation Material disclosed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements concerning such Evaluation Material, whether written or oral. All additions or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and must be signed by both parties.
10. Miscellaneous. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts.
11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All matters arising out of, or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the procedural and substantive laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any conflicts of law principles. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally agree (a) that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in any state or federal court in Delaware, (b) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and (c) that venue is proper in such courts in any such action or proceeding.
12. Waiver. No failure or delay by either party or any of its Representatives in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege under this Agreement.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT, dated as of July 22, 2008, is by and between Financial Investments Corporation (“Investor”) and Taylor Capital Group, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Taylor Bank, the “Company”).
WHEREAS, Investor has expressed an interest in discussing with the Company a possible financing transaction being considered by the Company (a “Transaction”);
WHEREAS, in connection with such discussions, the Company may disclose Evaluation Material (as defined below) to Investor; and
WHEREAS, the Company would not disclose the Evaluation Material to Investor, nor discuss with the Investor the possibility of a Transaction, unless Investor executed and delivered this Agreement to the Company, and the Company may be irreparably harmed if Investor or any of its Representatives (as defined below) were to take any of the actions prohibited under this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, Investor and the Company hereby agree as follows:
1. Evaluation Material. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Evaluation Material” shall mean any and all information provided to Investor by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Transaction whether in writing, orally, visually, electronically or in machine readable form, through demonstration or in any other manner, and shall include, without limitation, any information regarding or relating to the Company’s operations, business opportunities, costs, finances, personnel, marketing and promotion plans, financial statements, financial information and business practices or policies, and any other business information of the Company or the terms or existence of this Agreement, the Company’s consideration of a possible Transaction or any discussions between the parties with respect thereto, transmitted by or on behalf of the Company to Investor in connection with the Transaction, whether prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and whether or not such information is marked “confidential”. The term “Evaluation Material” does not include, and the obligations hereunder do not apply to, information, knowledge or data which (i) was in Investor’s or its Representatives’ (as defined below) possession prior to disclosure by the Company, or (ii) was or becomes available to Investor or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a party other than the Company provided that such party is not known to Investor, after reasonable inquiry, to be under an obligation of confidentiality to the Company with respect to such information, or (iii) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to the public (other than as a result of disclosure by Investor or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement), or (iv) Investor can demonstrate has been independently developed by it or on its behalf without reliance on the Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material transmitted by or on behalf of the Company shall remain the sole property of the Company.
2. Use of Evaluation Material. The Evaluation Material will be used by Investor solely in connection with its evaluation of a possible Transaction, and not for any other purpose whatsoever. The Evaluation Material will be kept confidential by Investor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not be disclosed to any person, except that Investor may disclose the Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its employees, officers, directors, partners, members, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, agents, consultants and advisors (these persons being collectively called “Representatives”) who (a) need to know such information in order for Investor to be
able to evaluate a possible Transaction and (b) have been directed by Investor to treat the Evaluation Material in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Representatives” as applied to Investor shall not include any potential principal, co-investor or source of equity financing that is not a party to this Agreement. Investor shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. Neither Investor nor any of its Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, (x) market or use (other than as permitted by the Agreement) any Evaluation Material, (y) reproduce or otherwise copy any Evaluation Material except in connection with the Transaction, or (z) disclose, sell, license, offer to sell or license or otherwise transfer or make available any Evaluation Material to any person other than as otherwise permitted by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investor will use all reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, efforts commensurate with those it employs for the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information. The term “person” as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any agency, corporation, individual, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity.
3. Exceptions. If Investor or its Representatives receive a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Evaluation Material, or if Investor or its Representatives are requested or required to disclose any Evaluation Material under law, governmental order, judicial order, regulatory or statutory requirement, discovery request, oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process, Investor shall notify the Company reasonably promptly following Investor or its Representatives first becoming aware of such requested disclosure, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the Company’s sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Furthermore, if the Company seeks such a protective order or other appropriate remedy in connection with a third-party request or requirement to disclose the Evaluation Material, Investor and its Representatives will not oppose such efforts. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Company waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and Investor or its Representatives are advised by legal counsel that they are legally compelled to make such disclosures, Investor or its Representatives, as the case may be, (i) may without liability hereunder furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material or other information regarding a possible Transaction that Investor or its Representatives are advised by legal counsel is legally required, (ii) will give the Company notice of the disclosures to be made to the extent legally permissible and (iii) will, if applicable, request that confidential treatment be accorded the Evaluation Material or other information regarding a possible Transaction so disclosed to the extent legally permissible; it being understood and agreed that there can be no such assurance that the tribunal or governmental or similar authority will grant any such request.
4. No Warranty. ALL EVALUATION MATERIAL IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND THE COMPANY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, PERFORMANCE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
5. No Legal Obligation, Representation, or Warranty. The parties agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into between the Company and Investor with respect to the Transaction, neither the Company nor Investor will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Nothing contained in any discussions between Investor and the Company or in any Evaluation Material shall be deemed to constitute a representation or warranty. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement, or understanding, whether oral or written, or any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing, or conduct.
6. Return of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the written request of the Company, Investor will, at its own expense,
(i) reasonably promptly redeliver to the Company or, at the at Investor’s option, destroy all copies (including permanently erasing or deleting any electronic copies) of the Evaluation Material in the possession or control of Investor or any of its Representatives and
(ii) reasonably promptly destroy all analyses, notes, data, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other documents and materials prepared by Investor or any of its Representatives in connection with their evaluation and review of a possible Transaction that contain, reflect or are based upon or generated from, in whole or in part, any of the Evaluation Material. Upon the Company’s written request, Investor will confirm any such destruction to the Company in writing. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Evaluation Material, Investor will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality hereunder respecting Evaluation Material, including without limitation, with respect to oral Evaluation Material and their obligation not to use any Evaluation Material for any purpose other than as specifically permitted in this Agreement.
7. Non-Solicitation. For a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, Investor will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire or offer to enter into any contract with any executive officer of the Company with whom Investor has contact, or of whom Investor otherwise becomes aware, during its discussions with the Company or its evaluation of a possible Transaction; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit Investor from engagement in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to the Company’s employees; and provided, further, that Investor shall not be prohibited from soliciting or hiring any such employee whose employment has been terminated by the Company or its affiliates.
8. Standstill. For a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, and except in connection with the Transaction, Investor will not, directly or indirectly, and Investor will cause any person controlled by Investor not to, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, partnership, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its affiliates, (iii) make, or in any way participate in any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (v) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) advise, assist or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing. Investor also agrees during such period not to (x) request the Company, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence), (y) take any action that would reasonably be expected to require the Company or any of its affiliates to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement or the possibility of a Transaction, or (z) communicate with the Company’s stockholders (other than communications with any of the officers of the Company, and any other employees of the Company designated by such officers, in the manner contemplated by this Agreement) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.
9. Acknowledgement. Investor acknowledges that it is aware, and that it will advise its Representatives who receive the Evaluation Material, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer (and options, warrants and rights relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.
10. Public Disclosure. Each of the Company and Investor acknowledge and agree that it will not, and it will cause its respective employees, representatives, affiliates and agents not to, publicly disclose, confirm or acknowledge the existence, or terms and conditions, of this Agreement, or the fact that the Company may be considering a possible Transaction with Investor, other than in a press release approved by each party hereto or as otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the parties hereto, except to the extent the Company believes in good faith, after consultation with counsel, it is required by any law, rule or listing requirement to make such disclosure, provided that the Company shall not identify the Investor or any of its affiliates by name without the Investor’s consent.
11. No License. Investor acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to Investor or any of its Representatives to any Evaluation Material, or to any copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patent rights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights of the Company.
12. Third-Party Contacts. Neither Investor nor any of its Representatives shall knowingly contact any employee (other than the officers of the Company and other employees designated by such officers in the manner contemplated by this Agreement), supplier or customer of the Company regarding the Transaction or the Company’s prospects, without the Company’s prior written consent.
13. No Commitment. Each of the Company and Investor understands and agrees that no contract or agreement or binding obligation providing for or with respect to any Transaction shall be created or deemed to exist unless and until a definitive agreement has been executed and delivered with respect thereto, and that, unless and until a definitive agreement between the parties has been executed and delivered, no party has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to enter into or pursue a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression, whether before or after the execution of this Agreement.
14. Equitable Remedies. Investor hereby agrees that a failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement would cause the Company irreparable harm and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by Investor or any of its Representatives because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered by the Company in the event that this Agreement is breached. Accordingly, the Company will be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach without proof of actual damages. Investor further agrees to waive, and to use its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Any such equitable remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company.
15. Authority. By signing below, each of the undersigned representatives of the parties hereto represents and warrants that he or she has full authority to execute this Agreement on his or her respective party’s behalf and to bind his or her respective party to the terms of the Agreement.
16. No Waiver. No course of action or failure to act by either party will constitute a waiver by a party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, and no waiver by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing.
17. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. However, if any provision of this Agreement is prohibited or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder thereof or any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
18. Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without reference to its conflicts of law principles. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois, which will be the sole venue for resolution of all disputes related to this Agreement. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
19. Entire Agreement; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Investor and the Company regarding the matters set forth herein, and no representations or promises have been made that are not fully set forth herein. This Agreement shall be binding solely on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
20. Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall serve as an original, but all of which shall constitute but one agreement. For purposes of executing this Agreement, any signed documents transmitted by facsimile machine with automatic confirmation of receipt shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original document. The signature of any party transmitted by facsimile machine shall be considered to be an original signature and any such document shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as an original document executed, delivered and exchanged between the parties. At the request of any party, any executed document delivered by facsimile machine shall be re-executed by all parties in a “hard-copy” form. The parties hereto hereby agree that none of them shall raise the use of a facsimile machine for the transmission of signatures as a defense to this Agreement and each such party hereby waives such defense.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned has caused this Non-Disclosure Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT
 This Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this ""Agreement""), is made as of September 17, 2001 between EarthLink, Inc. a Delaware corporation (""EarthLink""), and PeoplePC, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""PeoplePC""). EarthLink and PeoplePC are sometimes referred to herein individually as a ""Party"" and collectively as the ""Parties.""
 1. Purpose. EarthLink and PeoplePC wish to have discussions relating to a potential transaction (the ""Transaction"") between EarthLink (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders) and PeoplePC (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders). In the course of such discussions, each Party expects to make available to the other Party and its Representatives (as defined herein) Evaluation Material (as defined herein) concerning the businesses, financial condition, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, and prospects of such Party. As a condition to making such information available, each Party is entering this Agreement and agrees that all Evaluation Material received by it or its Representatives from the other Party or any of its Representatives shall be treated in accordance with this Agreement.
 2. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) the term ""Receiving Party"" means the Party receiving Evaluation Material; (ii) the term ""Furnishing Party"" means the Party providing Evaluation Material or causing Evaluation Material to be provided; (iii) the term ""Representatives"" means the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors engaged in connection with the review and evaluation of the Transaction) of the specified Party; and (iv) the term ""Evaluation Material"" means all proprietary and confidential information concerning the Furnishing Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in verbal, visual, written, electronic or other form, which is made available by the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Primary Evaluation Material""), together, in each case, with all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, studies, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based in whole or in part thereon prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Derivative Evaluation Material""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term ""Evaluation Material"" shall not include, and the Parties' obligations herein (other than their obligations under paragraph 6 of this Agreement) shall not extend to information which (a) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Furnishing Party; (b) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Evaluation Material; (c) is now or hereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party's Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives and such source is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party following reasonable inquiry, under any obligation to the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to keep such information confidential; or (e) is transmitted by or on behalf of the Furnishing Party after receiving written notification from the Receiving Party of the termination of discussions relating to the Transaction or written instructions from the Receiving Party not to furnish any further Evaluation Material.
 3. Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material.
 (a) Confidentiality of Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material (i) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and considering the Transaction; (ii) shall be kept strictly confidential by the Receiving Party; and (iii) shall be provided by the Receiving Party solely to those of its Representatives to whom disclosure is reasonably required to facilitate the Receiving Party's evaluation or consideration of the Transaction, it being the intention of the Parties to restrict the dissemination of Evaluation Material to as small a working group as practicable. The Parties agree that all Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Furnishing Party. Before providing access to Evaluation Material to any Representative, the Receiving Party shall inform such Representative of the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and shall advise such Representative that, by accepting possession of or access to such information, such Representative is agreeing to be bound by this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.
 (b) Compulsory Disclosure of Evaluation Material. If the Receiving Party or its Representatives are requested or required in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or otherwise), or the Receiving Party is so requested or required to disclose any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under paragraph (3)(e) of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall give the Furnishing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Furnishing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall reasonably cooperate with the Furnishing Party in seeking such an order. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party is nontheless, in the opinion of the Receiving Party's or (in the case of disclosure requested or required of a Representative, such Representative's) outside counsel or General Counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall use all requisite reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material to the extent such assurances are available. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Receiving Party may disclose Evaluation Material under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b) without liability hereunder.
 (c) Other Public Disclosure. Except (i) for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party consistent with advice of counsel, for the disclosing Party not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or order, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the order Party, neither Part shall:
 (x) make any disclosure (and each Party shall direct its Representatives not to make any disclosure) to any person of (A) the fact that discussions, negotiations or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, or the fact that either Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or (C) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any proposed Transaction, including the status of the discussions or negotiations related thereto, or
 (y) make any public statement concerning a proposed Transaction.
 (d) Notice If either Party proposes to make any disclosure in reliance on clause (i) above, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party with the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and shall in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the other Party concerning the nature and scope of the information it proposes to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may make such public announcement or public statement if in the opinion of such Party's outside counsel or General Counsel, such public announcement or public statement is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or of any rule or regulation of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system on which such Party's securities are listed or trade. In such event, the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to give advance notice to the other Party and to consult with the other Party on the timing and content of any such public announcement or public statement.
 (e) Certain Securities Law Restrictions. Each Party acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may contain material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party. Each Party further acknowledges its awareness of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on persons in possession of material nonpublic information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either Party that any Evaluation Material in fact contains material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party.
 (f) Contact with Employees and Representatives. Neither Party shall communicate with any employee of the other Party regarding the Transaction or disclose any Evaluation Material to any employee or Representative of the other Party, other than the employees and Representatives named on the working group lists provided by the Parties from time to time.
 (g) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party will be restricted from using the information contained in the Evaluation Material that is retained in the minds of Representatives who have had access to the other Party's Evaluation Material, unless such use shall infringe on any of such Party's patent rights, trademark rights or copyright rights.
 4. Accuracy of Evaluation Material: No Representations or Warranties. Each Party acknowledges and agrees (a) that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by either Party or any of its respective Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (b) that the Parties shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties (if any) that may be made in a definitive written agreement for the Transaction, signed and delivered by both Parties, and then only to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided therein.
 5. No Solicitation.
 (a) For a period of one year subsequent to the termination of discussions regarding a Transaction, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by the other Party (or any of its subsidiaries) with whom the hiring Party first has contact, or who first becomes known to the hiring Party. In the course of the Parties' discussions and due diligence with respect to the proposed Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either Party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring Party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring Party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring Party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other Party or (iii) is identified by a third party executive search firm or employment agency without any assistance from such Party.
 (b) For a period one year from the date of this Agreement, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party or the other Party's board of directors, either directly or indirectly through any affiliate or Representative or otherwise: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, by purchase, tender offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, ownership or control of any voting securities, or any direct or indirect right to acquire any voting securities, of the other Party, any subsidiary thereof, or any successor corporation thereto; (ii) make, or in any way participate in any ""solicitation"" of ""proxies"" (as such terms are used in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other Party; (iii) seek or propose to influence or control the management or policies of the other Party; (iv) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of any merger, acquisition or other business combination or extraordinary transaction involving the other Party or any of its subsidiaries or any securities or assets of the other Party or any of its subsidiaries; (v) form, join or in any way participate in a ""group""( as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in connection with any of the foregoing, or (vi) request the other Party or any of the other party's Representatives to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph 5(b) in any manner which may reasonably be expected to compel or result in public disclosure; provided that such limitations shall expire upon the public announcement of a third party tender offer for more than fifty percent of the outstanding voting 3
securities of the other Party or a business combination between the other Party and a third party. Each Party (the ""Representing Party"") represents and warrants to the other Party that as of the date of this Agreement the Representing Party does not directly or indirectly own or possess voting or dispositive control over any voting securities of the other Party.
 6. Return and Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time after termination of discussions by either Party with respect to the Transaction, upon the request of the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly (and in no event later than five business days after such request) (a) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the Furnishing Party all copies of all Primary Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is in a visual or written format and erase or destroy all copies of all such Primary Evaluation Material which is stored in electronic format, and (b) destroy or cause to be destroyed all Derivative Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Nothing herein shall obligate the Receiving Party to provide any Derivative Evaluation Material to the Furnishing Party. Notwithstanding the return, destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material hereunder, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
 7. Remedies. Each Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this Agreement by it or any of its Representatives, and that in addition to all other remedies which either Party may have, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that either Party should institute proceedings to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all expenses relating to the enforcement of this Agreement, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies.
 8. Miscellaneous.
 (a) No License. Neither Party grants a license, by implication or otherwise, under any of its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to the Receiving Party. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other Party's Evaluation Material. The Furnishing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently or in the future develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Material. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for its products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Evaluation Material, provided that the Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.
 (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the confidentiality of their discussions, negotiations and investigations concerning a Transaction.
 (c) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Parties.
 (d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement unless the enforcement of such provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.
 (e) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement to consummate a Transaction, to conduct or continue negotiations with respect to a Transaction, or to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, and neither Party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or by virtue of any other written or oral expression by the Parties' respective Representatives unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction is executed and delivered by both Parties, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Both Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not to provide Evaluation Material to the Receiving Party under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. If either Party determines not to proceed with negotiations with respect to a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of such determination.
 (f) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws thereof. Each Party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of Georgia, and the city of Atlanta, for the adjudication of any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement.

"Exhibit 99.8
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of October 17, 2016 by and between Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a Canadian corporation (“Fairfax”), and Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, a Swiss company (“Allied World”).
WHEREAS, in order to evaluate a possible business combination or similar transaction (the “Possible Transaction”) between Fairfax (or one of its affiliates) and Allied World, each of Fairfax and Allied World may disclose and deliver to the other party (such first party, when disclosing such information, being the “Disclosing Party” and such other party, when receiving such information, being the “Receiving Party”) certain information about the Disclosing Party and/or its subsidiaries for the sole purpose of enabling the Receiving Party to evaluate, negotiate and consummate the Possible Transaction; and
WHEREAS, as a condition to pursuing these discussions and exchanging information, the parties wish to enter into this Agreement to restrict the use and disclosure of such discussions and information and to provide for certain other matters;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Fairfax and Allied World mutually agree as follows:
1. Non-Disclosure Agreement.
(a) All information that is furnished directly or indirectly by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives (as defined below), whether or not marked as confidential and whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether in oral, written or electronic form, together with any notes, reports, summaries, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other materials prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that contain, references to or are based upon, in whole or in part, any information so furnished to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives pursuant hereto (such notes, reports, summaries, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other materials are referred to herein as “Derivative Materials”), is referred to herein as “Proprietary Information”. Proprietary Information does not include, however, information that (i) was or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, which source the Receiving Party does not know, after reasonable inquiry, to be in violation of any legal duty or obligation owed to the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives with respect to such information, (ii) was or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of a breach by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of this Agreement or a violation by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of any other non-use or confidentiality obligation), (iii) was previously in the possession of the Receiving Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without reference to the
Proprietary Information. The term “Representative” means, as to any person, such person’s affiliates, officers, directors, general partners, members, employees, consultants, investment bankers, financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel, consultants and potential lenders. The term “affiliate” has the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the regulations promulgated under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
(b) Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement or as required by applicable law, regulation, stock exchange rule or by legal, judicial, regulatory or administrative process (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) (“Legally Required”), (a) the Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep all Proprietary Information confidential and not disclose or reveal any Proprietary Information to any person other than its Representatives who are participating in evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction (all of whom shall be informed of the confidential nature of such Proprietary Information) and shall cause its Representatives to treat such Proprietary Information in a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that each party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its respective Representatives, (b) the Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than in connection with evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction or the consummation of the Possible Transaction, and (c) neither party shall, nor cause or permit their respective Representatives to, disclose to any person the existence or terms of this Agreement or that discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the Possible Transaction, or any term, condition or other matter relating to the Possible Transaction (the information referred to in this clause (c), the “Transaction Information”). For the avoidance of doubt, each of those affiliates and Representatives of a Receiving Party that do not receive or have access to the Proprietary Information of the other party and the Transaction Information shall not be bound by or subject to the terms of this Agreement.
2. Legally Required Disclosure; Return or Destruction of Proprietary Information. In the event the Receiving Party (or any of its Representatives) shall be Legally Required to disclose any Proprietary Information or Transaction Information, the Receiving Party shall, in advance of such disclosure, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with notice of such requirement and a description of the Proprietary Information and Transaction Information that the Receiving Party or its Representative intends to disclose and to reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to the extent it may seek to limit such disclosure, including, if requested, taking all reasonable steps, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, to resist or avoid any such legal, judicial, regulatory or administrative process or to obtain a protective order in respect thereof. Upon either party’s request, each party hereto shall (and shall cause its Representatives, and any other person, to whom it has disclosed any Proprietary Information or Transaction Information) promptly either (at the Receiving Party’s option) return to the other party hereto or destroy (and certify in writing to the other party by an authorized officer supervising such destruction) all copies or other reproductions of Proprietary Information of the other party, other than any Derivative Materials, in its possession or the possession of any of its Representatives, and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of such materials. The Receiving Party shall destroy all Derivative Materials, and such destruction will be certified in writing to the Disclosing Party by an authorized officer supervising such destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain data or electronic records containing Proprietary Information or Derivative Materials for the purposes of complying with its record retention policies or as required by applicable law so long as such data or records are not accessible in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Proprietary Information required by this Paragraph 2, for the duration of the term of this Agreement, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by all duties and obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.
3. Standstill. Each party hereby represents to the other party that, as of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its affiliates has beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries (other than securities owned by any benefit plan of such party). Each party further covenants and agrees, in consideration of it being furnished with Proprietary Information, that neither it nor any of its affiliates who have received or had access to the Proprietary Information of the other party (a “Restricted Affiliate”) will, at any time commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earliest of (a) the twelve (12) month anniversary of this Agreement, (b) the execution and delivery by Fairfax (or its affiliate(s)) and Allied World of a definitive agreement to effect the Possible Transaction and (c) a Fundamental Change Event (as defined below) with respect to the other party, directly or indirectly, unless requested in writing (or by email) by the other party’s chief executive officer, chairman or board of directors: (i) acquire (or agree, offer, seek or propose to acquire, in each case, publicly or privately), by purchase, tender offer, exchange offer, agreement or business amalgamation or combination or in any other manner, any ownership, including beneficial ownership, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of any material assets or businesses or any securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries, or any rights or options to acquire such ownership (including from any third party); (ii) publicly or privately offer to enter into, or publicly or privately propose, any merger, business combination, amalgamation, recapitalization, restructuring or other extraordinary transaction with the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) initiate any stockholder proposal or the convening of a stockholders’ meeting of or involving the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) solicit proxies (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act) or consents to vote with respect to any matter from, or otherwise seek to influence, advise or direct the vote of, holders of any shares of capital stock of the other party or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital stock; (v) otherwise seek or propose to influence, advise, change or control the management, board of directors, governing instruments, affairs or policies of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (vi) make any public disclosure, or take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public disclosure, with respect to any of the matters set forth in this Agreement or (vii) assist, advise, act in concert or participate with or encourage others to, including as part of a “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a party from making a non-public proposal to the other party with respect to any transaction of the type described in clause (ii) of this Paragraph 3, so long as such proposal is not knowingly made by such party in a manner that would require the public disclosure thereof by either party. A “Fundamental Change Event” means a party has after the date of this Agreement entered into a definitive written agreement with a third party providing for (i) any acquisition of a majority of the voting securities of such party by any person or group, (ii) any acquisition of a majority of the consolidated assets of such party and its subsidiaries by any person or group, or (iii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, amalgamation or any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction (provided that, in the case of any transaction covered by the foregoing clause (iii), immediately following such transaction, any person (or the direct or indirect shareholders of such person) will beneficially own a majority of the outstanding voting power of such party or the surviving parent entity in such transaction).
4. Non-Solicit. In consideration of being furnished the Proprietary Information by the other party, each party agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this Agreement, such party and its Restricted Affiliates shall not employ or solicit to employ any of the current officers or employees of the other party or its subsidiaries with whom such party or its Representatives has had contact in connection with the evaluation of the Possible Transaction or who were specifically identified to such party during the period of investigation of the other party pursuant to this Agreement, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. The use of an independent employment agency or employee search firm (so long as it is not directed by such party to solicit employees of the other party or its subsidiaries) or newspaper, trade publication or online job advertising and the hiring as a result thereof of any employee shall not be construed as a breach of this Agreement.
5. Term. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the earlier of (a) one (1) year from the date hereof and (b) the execution and delivery by Fairfax and Allied World of a definitive agreement to effect the Possible Transaction.
6. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be amended or modified only in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. This remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. The parties hereto agree that unless and until a definitive agreement is executed and delivered with respect to the Possible Transaction, neither party intends to be, nor shall either be, under any legal obligation with respect to the Possible Transaction or otherwise, by virtue of any written or oral expressions by themselves or their respective Representatives with respect to the Possible Transaction, including any obligation to commence or continue discussions or negotiations, except for the matters specifically agreed to in this Agreement. Neither party hereto makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, on which the other party may rely as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information and only those representations and warranties made in writing in a definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction, if any, shall have any legal effect. The parties hereto also agree that, other than as may be set forth in a definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction, neither party hereto shall have any liability whatsoever to the other party, including in contract, tort or under federal or state securities laws, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from, any errors or omissions in the Proprietary Information. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts which may be delivered by way of PDF or similar electronic facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

"EXHIBIT 10.4
CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of February 19, 2014, by and between Calpine Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices at 717 Texas Avenue, Suite 1000, Houston, Texas 77002 (""Calpine""); and LS Power Equity Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal executive offices at 1700 Broadway, 35th Floor, NY, NY 10019 (“LS Power”), referred to collectively as ""Parties"" and individually as ""Party.""
RECITALS
A. The Parties desire to exchange certain proprietary or confidential information for the purpose of evaluating the potential acquisition of certain of Calpine’s power generating facilities and other assets (the “Proposed Transaction”); and
B. The Parties are willing to provide such information for such purpose in accordance with the terms hereof; NOW, THEREFORE, Calpine and LS Power do hereby mutually agree as follows:
1. Definitions.
a. ""Confidential Information"" shall mean all confidential or proprietary written, recorded, electronic or oral information or data (including without limitation research, developmental, engineering, manufacturing, technical, marketing, sales, financial, operating, performance, cost, business and process information or data, trade secrets, discoveries, ideas, designs, data, source code, object code, processes, computer programs, developments, flow diagrams, know-how, and computer programming and other software and software techniques) provided (whether such confidentiality or proprietary status is indicated orally or in writing, whether or not the specific words ""confidential"" or ""proprietary"" are used) to a Party (the “Receiving Party”) by the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) in the course of the exchange of such information or data between the Parties. Without limiting the aforesaid, the existence of discussions between the Parties regarding the Proposed Transaction shall constitute Confidential Information hereunder.
b. “Person” shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.
c. “Representatives” shall mean as to any Person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys and accountants).
2. Confidentiality and Non-Use. In consideration of each Party's providing Confidential Information, the Parties agree as follows:
a. The Receiving Party shall hold confidential and not disclose to any Person, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, all Confidential Information and any information about the Proposed Transaction, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction;
b. The Receiving Party shall cause all its Representatives to observe the terms of this Agreement and shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives; and
c. The Receiving Party shall return or destroy all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request.
In addition to the foregoing, the Receiving Party will not use the Confidential Information (a) in any way detrimental to the Disclosing Party’s shareholders or (b) for any purpose other than in connection with the Proposed Transaction between the Parties.
3. Exceptions to the Confidentiality and Non-Use Obligations. The obligations imposed by Section 2 hereof shall not apply, or shall cease to apply, to any Confidential Information if or when, but only to the extent that, such Confidential Information:
a. was known to the Receiving Party prior to the receipt of the Confidential Information; or
b. was, or becomes through no breach of the Receiving Party's obligations hereunder, known to the public; or
c. becomes known to the Receiving Party from sources other than the Disclosing Party under circumstances not involving any breach of any confidentiality obligation; or
d. is independently developed by the Receiving Party, as evidenced by the written records thereof.
It shall not be a breach of the confidentiality obligations hereof for a Receiving Party to disclose Confidential Information where, but only to the extent that, such disclosure is required by law or applicable legal process, provided in such case the Receiving Party shall (i) give the earliest notice possible to the Disclosing Party that such disclosure is or may be required and (ii) reasonably cooperate in protecting such confidential or proprietary nature of the Confidential Information which must so be disclosed.
4. No Further Agreements Hereunder. Neither Calpine nor LS Power or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, shall be under any obligation to enter into any further agreements with the other signatory hereto or its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates of any nature whatsoever as a result of this Agreement. The Parties shall be free at all times to hold negotiations or enter into agreements with any other persons whatsoever (including with respect to projects under discussion by the Parties hereto) in addition to or in lieu of the discussions hereunder and any such activities shall not be a breach of this agreement or any obligations owed to the other Party hereunder. Each Party hereto reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to decline, to retract or to reject at any time any proposal which has not yet become legally binding by execution of a written agreement between the Parties with respect thereto, or with respect to any further agreements or business arrangements with the other Party hereto, its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates and to terminate all further discussions and negotiations.
5. No Representations and Warranties. Each of the Parties make no representation or warranties, express or implied, of any kind to the other Party with respect to the Confidential Information, including without limitation with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof. Any representations or warranties shall be made thereby, if at all, only in definitive written agreements that may be entered into hereafter.
6. Termination; Duration of Obligations. Unless sooner terminated by mutual written Agreement of the Parties hereto, this Agreement and the obligations hereunder shall terminate one (1) year from the date hereof.
7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties and supersedes all prior communications, agreements and understandings between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof.
8. Waivers; Amendments; Assignment; Counterparts. This Agreement may not be modified, amended or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by both Parties. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other and shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the respective successors of the Parties thereto. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterpart originals, each of which shall constitute an original document. The Parties agree that this Agreement can be executed via facsimile signatures and be binding.
9. Governing Law; Disputes. This Agreement is made subject to and shall be construed under the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, and that the state and federal courts situated in the State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any disputes with respect to this Agreement or the Confidential Information with each Party irrevocably consenting to the jurisdiction thereof for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Confidential Information, and each Party irrevocably waives its rights to jury trials with respect thereto.
10. Remedies. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either Party, each Party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement and the Receiving Party shall not plead in defense thereto that there would be an adequate remedy at law.

"Exhibit (d)(2)
MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (this “Agreement”) by and between Jamba, Inc., a Delaware corporation, including on behalf of its affiliates (the “Company”), and FOCUS Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation, including on behalf of its subsidiaries (the “Participant” and together with the Company, each a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), is dated as of the latest date set forth on the signature page hereto (the “Effective Date”).
1. General. In connection with the consideration of a possible negotiated transaction (a “Possible Transaction”) between the Parties, each Party (in its capacity as a provider of information hereunder, a “Provider”) is prepared to make available to the other Party (in its capacity as a recipient of information hereunder, a “Recipient”) certain Evaluation Material (as defined in Section 2 below) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and hereby agrees to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth.
2. Definitions.
(a) The term “affiliates” shall mean, with respect to any Person, any other Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such Person.
(b) The term “Beneficial Ownership” when used with reference to a security shall have the meaning ascribed to it under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), except that for purposes of this definition, the term security shall include any option, warrant, or convertible security regardless of exercise or conversion date, and also include any stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the security or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of the security, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in securities or otherwise and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of the security.
(c) The term “Evaluation Material” means information (whether oral, written, electronic or otherwise) concerning Provider which has been or is furnished to Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of Provider in connection with Recipient’s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including Provider’s business, financial condition, operations, assets, liabilities, personnel and contracts, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by Recipient or its Representatives which contain or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by the Provider hereunder. The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Recipient or any of its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within a Recipient’s or its Representatives’ (on behalf of Recipient) possession, prior to its being furnished to Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of Provider or (iii) is or becomes available to Recipient or its Representatives (on behalf of Recipient) from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, Provider with respect to such information or (iv) Recipient can reasonably show was independently developed by Recipient or Recipient’s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives.
(d) The term “Representatives” shall include the directors, officers, employees, potential financing sources, partners, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) of a Party who have a need to know the Evaluation Material for purposes of evaluating a Possible Transaction, but only those of the foregoing who actually receive Evaluation Material directly from or at the direction of such Party. For the avoidance of doubt, Roark Capital Acquisition LLC shall be a Representative of FOCUS Brands Inc. under this Agreement.
(e) The term “Person” includes the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.
3. Use of Evaluation Material. Each Recipient shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and (ii) keep the Evaluation Material confidential, and, subject to Section 5, will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to Recipient’s Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of helping Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction. Each Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of such Recipient’s Representatives.
This Agreement does not grant Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use Provider’s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. In addition, all proprietary and intellectual property rights in and to the Evaluation Material shall remain the sole property of Provider, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed in any way to grant to Recipient or its Representatives or any other Person any express or implied option, license or other right, title or interest in or to any Evaluation Material, or to any intellectual property rights embodied in such Evaluation Material.
4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such Party will not, and will cause its Representative not to, disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been exchanged between the Parties, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or any other transaction between the Parties or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof) ; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to inhibit, impair or restrict the ability of Recipient or its Representatives from having discussions or negotiations with other persons relating to potential financing in connection with the Possible Transaction so long as each of such Persons agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Representatives.
5. Legally Required Disclosure. If a Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, such Recipient shall provide Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement together with copies of the material proposed to be disclosed so that Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Provider, a Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled or required to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 or would be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such Recipient or its respective Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled or required to disclose, provided that Recipient and/or its Representatives cooperate with Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Recipient nor Recipient’s Representatives shall be required to provide notice or seek consent to disclose any information in connection with a routine audit by, or blanket request from, a regulatory or governmental entity with jurisdiction over Recipient or Recipient’s Representatives, and not directed at the Company or the Possible Transaction; provided that the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, inform any such authority of the confidential nature of the information disclosed to them and to keep such information confidential in accordance with such authority’s policies or procedures.
6. “Click Through” Agreements. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum or electronic database, dataroom, or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which Recipient or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement or a Possible Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that Recipient’s and its Representatives’ confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be reduced or enlarged except by an agreement executed by the Parties hereto in traditional written format.
7. Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the request of a Provider for any reason, a Recipient will, and will direct its Representatives to, promptly, but not later than 10 business days, after receipt of such notice or request, destroy or return (at Recipient’s option) all Evaluation Material and all documents that incorporate Evaluation Material, and no copy or extract thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained, except that Recipient and its Representatives may retain one copy to be kept confidential and used solely for archival, legal, and compliance purposes. Recipient shall provide to the Provider written confirmation of destruction signed by an authorized representative of Recipient. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by such Recipient’s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material.
8. No Solicitation. Recipient will not, within eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly solicit the employment or consulting services of or employ or engage as a consultant any of the senior or key employees of the Provider or any of its subsidiaries nor any other employee of the Provider or any if its subsidiaries with whom Recipient has had direct contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction or of whom it has become aware as a result of its receipt of any Evaluation Material, so long as they are employed by the Provider or any of its subsidiaries and for two months thereafter. For the purposes of clarification, the mere receipt of Provider’s employee list by Recipient shall not be considered a solicitation of or a direct contact with such employees pursuant to this section. A Recipient is not prohibited from: (i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at any particular individual or the employees of the Provider or its subsidiaries generally or (ii) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit individuals for employment on behalf of such Recipient (and soliciting any person identified by any such recruiting firm or organization) so long as such Recipient does not identify either Provider or any of the individuals employed by Provider to be solicited by such recruiting firm or organization. The provisions of this Section 8 shall terminate and be of no further effect upon the acquisition of such Provider by a third party.
9. Standstill. Participant does not own any of the capital stock of the Company as of the Effective Date. Participant agrees that, for a period of one year after the date of this Agreement (the “Standstill Period”), unless specifically invited in writing by the Company, neither it nor (1) any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, (2) its Representatives (acting on its behalf), or (3) Roark Capital Acquisition LLC or its affiliates who receive Evaluation Material directly from Roark Capital Acquisition LLC or Participant or at their direction, will in any manner, directly or indirectly:
(a) effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in:
(i) any acquisition of any securities (or any acquisition of Beneficial Ownership thereof) or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
(iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the Company;
(b) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined under the Act) with respect to the securities of the Company;
(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit an unsolicited proposal for or offer of (with or without condition), any extraordinary transaction involving the Company or its securities or assets;
(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company;
(e) take any action which may reasonably be expected to force the Company to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above; or
(f) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.
Participant also agrees, and will cause its Representatives to agree, during the Standstill Period, not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this Section 9 (including this sentence).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9 to the contrary, if, at any time during the Standstill Period, a public announcement is made by the Company or any other Person (other than Participant or its Representatives) that a third party (other than Participant or its Representatives) intends to acquire at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, voting control or a material part of the Company’s assets (by way of a tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest, acquisition or other similar transaction), or if a definitive agreement is executed by the Company with a third party relating to such an acquisition of capital stock or assets, the restrictions set forth in this Section 9 shall immediately terminate and cease to be of any further effect on Participant.
Participant further agrees, and will cause its Representatives to agree, that unless otherwise directed by the Company in writing (i) all communications with the Company regarding a Possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, facility tours, or management meetings, and (iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures with respect to a Possible Transaction, will be submitted or directed by Participant or its Representatives only to David Pace, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, or a person or persons designated in writing by David Pace. Further, except upon the Company’s prior written consent, neither Participant nor its Representatives acting on behalf of Participant involved with a Possible Transaction or who have received Evaluation Material will, directly or indirectly, contact any stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or any customer or supplier of the Company, regarding the Evaluation Material or a Possible Transaction. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Participant or its Representatives from maintaining any contacts in the ordinary course of business unrelated to a Possible Transaction or from conducting consumer surveys or other due diligence, in each case, without disclosing or relying on any Evaluation Material.
10. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.
11. Compliance with Securities Laws. Each Recipient acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may include material nonpublic information (within the meaning of the securities laws of the United States) with respect to Provider. Each Recipient agrees not to use and will cause its Representatives to agree not to use any Evaluation Material of Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.
12. Not a Transaction Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until both Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Each Party also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Neither Party is under any obligation to accept any proposal regarding a Possible Transaction and either Party may terminate discussions and negotiations with the other Party at any time.
13. No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose. Each Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of Provider and shall have no liability to Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to a Recipient or its respective Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to Recipient, Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating Provider to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.
14. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.
15. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed.
16. Legal Fees. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either Party or its Representatives has breached this Agreement, then the Party which is, or the Party whose Representatives are, determined to have so breached shall be liable and pay to the other Party the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the other Party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.
17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state.
18. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.
19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.
20. Term. This Agreement, and all obligations and other provisions hereunder, shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.
21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter.
22. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument.
23. Consent to Representation. This agreement also constitutes notice to Participant that the Company has engaged DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms as its legal counsel in connection with the Possible Transaction, and Participant hereby (i) consents to the continued representation of the Company by DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms in relation to the Possible Transaction notwithstanding the fact that DLA Piper LLP (US) may have represented, and may currently or in the future represent, Participant and/or any of its respective affiliates with respect to unrelated matters and (ii) waive any actual or alleged conflict and actual or alleged violation of ethical or comparable rules applicable to DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms that may arise from its representation of the Company in connection with the Possible Transaction, including but not limited to representing the Company against Participant and/or its affiliates in litigation, arbitration, or mediation in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any dispute (including litigation, arbitration, or mediation) between the Parties related to this Agreement, DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms will not represent either Party. In addition, Participant hereby acknowledges that the consent and waiver under this paragraph is voluntary and informed, and that Participant has obtained independent legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver. Participant further agrees that they are each aware of the extent of their respective relationships, if any, with DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliate firms, and do not require additional information from DLA Piper LLP (US) in order to understand the nature of this consent. Each of DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms are an express third party beneficiary of this paragraph.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned entities has caused this Agreement to be signed by its duly authorized representative as of the date written below.

NON-DISCLOSURE/NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE/NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made this 28th day of February, 2014 by and between TROY HOLDINGS INTERNATIONAL, INC., an Ontario Canada corporation (the “Seller”), EPAZZ, INC., an Illinois corporation (the “Purchaser”), TELECORP PRODUCTS, INC., a Michigan corporation (the “Company”), Troy Inc. (“Shareholder”), ANA MISRA, an individual (“Misra”) and SCOTT MacCANNELL, an individual (“MacCannell”) (Misra and MacCannell are also hereinafter referred to as “Key Personnel”).
RECITALS:
A. The Purchaser is purchasing the stock of the Company, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated February 21, 2014 (the “SPA”).
B. The Seller and Shareholder each acknowledges that the Seller and the Shareholder have received and/or will receive substantial and adequate monetary consideration and benefits in return for entry into the SPA and this Agreement and that the Seller and the Shareholder have freely chosen to enter into the terms of this Agreement.
C. The Key Personnel each acknowledge that each is an officer of Seller and has received and/or will receive substantial and adequate monetary consideration and benefits in return for entry into this Agreement and that each has freely chosen to enter into the terms of this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Recitals and covenants and agreements, hereinafter contained, the parties agree as follows:
1. Incorporation by Reference. The Recitals are incorporated and made a part of this Agreement by reference thereto.
2. Non-Disclosure.
As a material part of the consideration given and received by the parties in connection with the SPA:
a. Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder, jointly and severally, acknowledge and agree that in the course of ownership and/or employment with the Company that Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder have acquired and/or the Company has and will continue to provide Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder with, or access to information regarding the business, procedures, activities and services of the Company, including but not limited to, memorandum, files, forms, techniques, methods and procedures, programs, customer accounts and customer lists, supplier lists, costs and prices of the Company, and customer needs, requirements and business affairs (hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Proprietary Property”) as is necessary or desirable to assist him in his activities on behalf of the Company.
b. Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder hereby acknowledge that the Proprietary Property is the sole and exclusive property of the Company that the Proprietary Property is a valuable, special and unique asset of the business of the Company, developed at considerable expense to the Company, and is not available to the public at large or other persons engaging in businesses which are the same as or similar to the business of the Company.
c. Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder covenant and agree that each shall not for a period of one (1) year, communicate or divulge to, or use for the benefit of itself or any other person, firm, association or corporation, any information in any way relating to the Proprietary Property, in competition with the business of the Company.
3. Covenant Not To Compete.
As a material part of the consideration given and received by the parties:
a. Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder, jointly and severally, expressly covenant and agree that for a period of one (1) year, Seller will not engage in any business or perform any service, directly or indirectly, in competition with the business of the Company, or have any interest, whether as proprietor, partner, employee, stockholder, principal, agent, consultant, director, officer, or in any other capacity or manner whatsoever, in any enterprise that shall engage in the business of the Company, except through publicly-traded shares of a corporation or mutual fund listed on a major stock exchange.
b. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, Key Personnel and Shareholder agree that for a period of one (1) year, Key Personnel and Shareholder shall not (aa) directly or indirectly, solicit or service in any way, on behalf of itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with others, any customers, or prospective customers who have been solicited or serviced by the Company; (bb) directly or indirectly take any action which may induce any customer or divert any business from the Company; or (cc) directly or indirectly, for himself or any enterprise engaged in competition with the Company, solicit for employment or employ any employee who is then employed by the Company or who has been employed by the Company within one (1) year prior to the termination of his employment.
c. The covenants on the part of Key Personnel and Shareholder contained in this Agreement shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in this Agreement or the SPA. The existence of any claim or cause of action of Seller and/or Shareholder against the Company or Purchaser, whether predicated on this Agreement, the SPA or otherwise shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of this Agreement.
d.
(i) Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder understand that the provisions of this Agreement contain restrictive covenants and prohibit the disclosure of the Proprietary Property of the Company, agree to the reasonability of said provisions, and do herewith expressly agree and acknowledge that their breach of this Agreement will not be adequately compensated by money damages. Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are a reasonable and necessary protection of the legitimate interests of the Company and that any violation of these restrictions would cause substantial irreparable injury to the Company. Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder acknowledge that Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement without receiving the consideration offered by Seller and Shareholder in binding itself to these restrictions.
(ii) Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder expressly agree that in the event of any suit which may be brought by the Company for any violation of the provisions of this Agreement, any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement shall entitle the Company to any and/or of the following remedies:
(aa) an order in any such suit enjoining Seller, Key Personnel and Shareholder from violating said provisions. An order to that effect may be entered at any stage of such litigation, without the requirement to post bond, and any application for such injunction shall be without prejudice to any other right of action which may accrue to the parties by reason of the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement; and
(bb) an order in any such suit providing for monetary damages.
(iii) The remedies contained in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver by the parties, nor shall the parties be precluded from availing themselves of any of the rights and remedies available to them in law or in equity.
(iv) If any portion or portions of the covenants contained herein shall be, for any reason, held invalid or unenforceable or deemed to be too excessive and, therefore unenforceable, such portion or portions of the covenant shall be reinterpreted by the court who shall have made such determination to requalify the limitations provided therein so as to make the covenant enforceable, so long as to make the covenant enforceable, so long as the modifications to be made therein will not substantially defeat the original purposes of the parties hereto and the parties hereto agree to be bound by such reinterpretation.

MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Non-Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is effective as of October 20, 2011 (“Effective Date”) and is entered into between SuccessFactors, Inc., a Delaware corporation, having a place of business at 1500 Fashion Island Boulevard, San Mateo, California, 94404, USA (“Company”), and SAP AG, a German company with its place of business at Dietmar Hopp Allee 16, 69190 Walldorf, Germany on behalf of itself and its wholly owned subsidiaries, (“SAP”). In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, SAP and Company, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree to the following:
1. In connection with an evaluation relating to a potential relationship, cooperation or transaction (the “Evaluation”), SAP and Company may deliver to each other, upon the execution of this Agreement, Confidential Information as defined below (the party disclosing such Confidential Information being the “Disclosing Party” and the party receiving such Confidential Information being the “Receiving Party”).
2. As used herein, “Confidential Information” shall mean all information furnished by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives (defined below) to the Receiving Party or its Representatives, whether orally, in writing, electronically or in other tangible form, and identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party or otherwise disclosed in a manner such that a reasonable person would understand its confidential nature, including but not limited to, information that is related to: (a) the business plans or operations of the Disclosing Party; (b) the research and development or investigations of the Disclosing Party; (c) the business of any customer or partner of the Disclosing Party; (d) Disclosing Party’s properties, employees, finances, operations; (e) any information about or concerning any third party (which information was provided to the Disclosing Party subject to an applicable confidentiality obligation to such third party); (f) software and related documentation (“Disclosing Party’s Software”) including the following information regarding Disclosing Party’s Software: (i) computer software (object and source codes), programming techniques and programming concepts, methods of processing, system designs embodied in Disclosing Party’s Software; and (ii) discoveries, inventions, concepts, designs, flow charts, documentation, product specifications, application program interface specifications, techniques and processes relating to Disclosing Party’s Software; and (g) product offerings, content partners, product pricing, product availability, technical drawings, algorithms, processes, ideas, techniques, formulas, data, schematics, trade secrets, know-how, improvements, inventions (whether patentable or not), marketing plans, forecasts and strategies. Where the Confidential Information has not been reduced to written or other tangible form at the time of disclosure, and such disclosure is made orally or visually, the Disclosing Party agrees to identify it as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure. “Confidential Information” shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives which contain or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to the receiving party or its Representatives pursuant hereto.
3. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original. The Receiving Party:
(a) shall take all reasonable steps (defined below) to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential; (b) shall not disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any person other than its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in the Evaluation or who otherwise need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of the Evaluation; (c) shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with the Evaluation. and (d) shall not disclose to any person (other than those of its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in the Evaluation or who otherwise need to know for the purpose of the Evaluation) any information about the Evaluation, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives. As used herein “reasonable steps” means those steps the Receiving Party takes to protect its own similar proprietary and confidential information, which shall not be less than a reasonable standard of care. As used herein. “Representatives” shall mean (i) employees of Receiving Party; (ii) attorneys, accountants, or other professional business advisors and, additionally,
(iii) employees of the Receiving Party and those entities directly or indirectly owned by the Receiving Party, in each case, who shall be informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.
4. The above restrictions on the use or disclosure of the Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) is independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, or is lawfully received free of restriction from a third party having the right to furnish such Confidential Information; (b) has become generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party; (c) at the time of disclosure to Receiving Party was known to such party free of restriction; or (d) Disclosing Party agrees in writing is free of such restrictions.
5. Neither party is required to disclose any particular information to the other and any disclosure is entirely voluntary and is not intended to be construed as: (a) granting rights by license or otherwise under any trademark, patent, copyright or other intellectual property right; (b) creating a commitment as to any product, including the development or functionality of any product; (c) soliciting any business or incurring any obligation not specified herein; or (d) prohibiting either party from associating themselves with competitors of the other party for purposes substantially similar to those involved herein.
6. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict either party’s right to develop, make, use, market, license or distribute products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information as long as it shall not thereby breach this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information. Further, either party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals (defined below) resulting from access to or work with Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. The term “residuals” means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information so long as such persons have not studied the information for the purpose of replicating the same from memory. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. The party using any information that it claims to be residuals will have the burden of proving that the information constitutes residuals.
7. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Disclosing Party or the Evaluation, unless prohibited by law, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Disclosing Party (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy; (ii) to consult with the Receiving Party with respect to the Disclosing Party’s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process; or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained in a timely manner, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, the Receiving Party or its Representative shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and to require that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment.
8. To the extent that any Confidential Information may Include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by a party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.
9. Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall (at the Receiving Party’s election) promptly return or destroy (provided that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of the Receiving Party) all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or an intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in the Receiving Party’s possession or in the possession of any Representative of the Receiving Party; provided, however: (i) that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Confidential Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered; (ii) that the Receiving Party shall not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Confidential Information held electronically in archive or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or backup policies; and (iii) that the Receiving Party shall not be obligated to return or destroy Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to retain a copy pursuant to applicable law, and further provided that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use reasonable measures to cause its employees not to, access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up.
10. Each Party hereto acknowledges that neither it nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Confidential Information.
11. Until a separate definitive agreement regarding a potential relationship or transaction has been executed by the parties, neither party shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to any proposal, term sheet, letter of intent, or draft agreement relating to any such potential relationship or transaction (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (a) may conduct the process that may or may not result in definitive agreement in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party); and (b) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties’ consideration of the potential relationship or transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party and requesting that the other party return or destroy the Confidential Information as described above). Either party can end the discussions at any time, for any reason, and without liability to the other. Any business decision either party makes in anticipation of definitive agreements is at the sore risk of the party making the decision, even if the other party is aware of or has indicated approval of, such decision.
12. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
13. In consideration of the Information being furnished to SAP and the Company, each of SAP and the Company hereby agree that, until twelve (12) months after the date of termination of this Agreement, such party will not solicit for employment with such party or any of its subsidiaries, or employ, any of the current officers or employees of the other party with whom such party has had contact during the term of this Agreement and who became known by such party or who was identified to such party as part of the Evaluation under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict or preclude either party from (A) making generalized searches for employees (by use of advertisements in the media, the engagement of search firms or otherwise), (B) continuing its ordinary course hiring practices that are not targeted specifically at employees of the other party or (C) hiring an employee of the other party who first initiates an employment discussion with such party, so long as such party has not violated the restrictions on solicitation contained in this Agreement.
14. In consideration of the Confidential Information being provided to a Receiving Party for purposes of the Evaluation, the parties agree that until one (1) year after the date of termination of this Agreement, neither party nor any of each party’s affiliates or its Representatives acting on the party’s behalf will, unless specifically invited in writing by the other party’s Board of Directors or its duly authorized representative: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any voting securities or direct or indirect rights to acquire any voting securities, or indebtedness of the other party or any subsidiary thereof, or any successor entity; (ii) make, directly or indirectly, any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “34 Act”)) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other party; (iii) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of any merger, consolidation, stock purchase tender or exchange offer, restructuring or business combination, involving the other party or to purchase, directly or indirectly, a material portion of the assets of the other party or its subsidiaries; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act) in connection with any of the foregoing; (v) request the other party or any of the other party’s Representatives to amend or waive any provisions of this paragraph in a manner that would require public disclosure of such request; or (vi) take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any of the events described in sub-clauses (i) through (v). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, (1) each party shall be permitted at any time and from time to time to submit to the Chief Executive Officer of the other party one or more offers, proposals or indications of interest related to a transaction between the parties, provided that each such submission is made on a confidential basis and states that the provider does not intend to make a public announcement related to such submission or its text or contents and that the provider of such submission believes, after discussion with its counsel, that the receipt thereof by the other party does not require public disclosure of such submission and (2) no party shall be bound by the foregoing restrictions in the event that any person or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act) other than such party or its affiliates shall (x) acquire or publicly propose to acquire, by purchase, merger, tender offer, reorganization, consolidation or otherwise, beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the other party or assets of the other party or its subsidiaries representing more than 50% of the consolidated earning power of the other party and its subsidiaries and the other party’s Board of Directors has recommended to such other party’s shareholders that such acquisition be approved or (y) enter into an agreement or publicly propose to enter into an agreement providing for the merger or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the other party in which, following consummation of such transaction, substantially all of the persons or entities who, immediately prior to such transaction, had beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting power of the other party would not continue to beneficially own by virtue of their exchange or retention of securities of such other party representing at least 50% of the voting power of the combined entity and would not have the ability to elect a majority of the directors of the combined entity and the other party’s Board of Directors has recommended to such other party’s shareholders that such merger, consolidation or similar transaction be approved.
15. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either party hereto, each party hereto shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the other party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement.
16. The Receiving Party acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty regarding the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, any representation or warranty as to the completeness or accuracy of the Confidential Information.
17. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, other than such principles directing application of New York law. The parties agree the courts of the State of California shall be the exclusive venue for disputes arising under this Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
18. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto as to Confidential Information disclosed hereunder in connection with the Evaluation and merges all prior discussions between them relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the parties have entered into, or enter into in the future, other agreements which contain terms concerning ownership or use of work product of either party or software license provisions and rights, then this Agreement shall not supersede either party’s rights and obligations as provided in such other agreements, unless such other agreement specifically provides otherwise. Neither Party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of each of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives. Any waiver of a provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a subsequent waiver of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
19. The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year beginning with the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier by either party at such party’s sole discretion upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. The provisions herein concerning the disclosure, protection and use of Confidential Information, including Sections 3, 4, 7 and 9, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The non-solicit and standstill obligations shall remain in effect as provided in Sections 13 or 14, as applicable.

"EXECUTION VERSION
NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made effective as of February 18, 2013, by and between Central European Distribution Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“CEDC”) and W&L Enterprises Ltd. (the “Recipient”).
 WHEREAS, CEDC has issued (i) 3.00% Convertible Notes due 2013 (the “Convertible Notes”) and (ii) $380 million 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 and €430 ($556.6 million) 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (collectively, the “2016 Notes” and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”).
 WHEREAS, the Recipient holds 7,517,549 shares of CEDC’s outstanding common stock (the “Common Stock”).
 WHEREAS the Recipient and CEDC wish to enter into discussions with respect to a potential restructuring of the Notes and Common Stock (a “Restructuring”).
WHEREAS, CEDC, in such discussions, may disclose certain confidential information to the Recipient in order to initiate, facilitate, and/or progress such restructuring discussions (the “Purpose”).
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration for receiving certain confidential information and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Scope of Confidential Information.
1.1 Subject to Section 1.2 below, “Confidential Information” means confidential, secret, proprietary or other non-public information pertaining to the business, operations, brands, marketing plans, financial matters, legal matters, products, projects, business plans or practices, research and development, product development, intellectual property, financial models, trademarks, trade secrets, accounting and financing data, and methods of production, distribution or procurement, suppliers, distributors, consultants, advisors or employees, directors or officers of CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries (defined below) (together, the “CEDC Group”) that is disclosed or otherwise made available, either orally or in writing, by any member of the CEDC Group to the Recipient or its affiliates, agents, or advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys, banks and other sources of equity and debt financing and accountants) (collectively, “Representatives”).
1.2 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is or becomes publicly available (other than through a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient), (b) is in the possession of or known to the Recipient or its Representatives prior to such information having been furnished to Recipient hereunder, (c) is independently conceived, developed or discovered by the Recipient or on its behalf, (d) is made available to the Recipient or its Representatives by any person other than a member of the CEDC Group without any known breach of any obligation of confidentiality of such other person, or (e) is the subject of a written confirmation from CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of the CEDC Group stating that any such information is not Confidential Information. In clarification of the foregoing, a general disclosure in the public domain will not cause more specific (but related) information to be excluded as Confidential Information under one of the above exceptions.
1.3 “Subsidiary” of any entity means any other entity in which such first entity owns or Controls, directly or indirectly, an amount of the voting securities, other voting interests or voting partnership interests sufficient to elect at least a majority of such other entity’s board of directors or other governing body (or, if there are no such voting interests, 50% or more of the equity interests of such other entity). For purposes of this Section 1.3, “Control” means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an individual, corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
2. Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information.
2.1 The Recipient agrees that all Confidential Information will be held and maintained by it in the strictest confidence, will be used by it solely and exclusively for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and implementing a Restructuring, and will not, directly or indirectly, be used or disclosed by it for any other purpose whatsoever. CEDC acknowledges that Recipient is engaged in businesses similar to those conducted by CEDC and the CEDC Group or other industries in the ordinary course of Recipient’s business. The Recipient will use reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information, provided that such care shall be at least as great as the precautions taken by the Recipient to protect its own confidential information of similar nature.
2.2 The Recipient agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of CEDC, directly or indirectly, disclose all or any portion of the Confidential Information, or the substance thereof, to any third party other than its Representatives in connection with the Purpose, except, subject to Section 2.3 below, to the extent required by applicable law or legal process.
2.3 The Recipient agrees that if the Recipient is required by any law, court or governmental order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient will provide CEDC, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, with prompt written notice of such requirement so that CEDC or the applicable member of the CEDC Group may seek an appropriate protective order with respect thereto. If such an order is not obtained, only that portion of the Confidential Information shall be furnished that is legally required to be furnished, at the sole expense of CEDC or one of its Subsidiaries, and the Recipient shall exercise commercial efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to CEDC shall not be required where disclosure is made (i) in response to a request by a regulatory or self-regulatory authority, or (ii) in connection with a routine audit or examination by a bank examiner or auditor, and such request, audit or examination does not reference CEDC or this Agreement.
2.4 The Recipient shall ensure that each of its Representatives who are either provided with Confidential Information, or otherwise have access to such Confidential Information, are informed of its confidential nature and are directed to abide by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Representatives or appropriate duties or obligations of confidentiality imposing confidentiality obligations on such Representatives (except that there shall be no requirement to so inform where the Representative to whom the information is to be disclosed is subject to professional obligations to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information or is otherwise bound by requirements of confidentiality in relation to the Confidential Information). The Recipient agrees to be liable for any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its affiliates or Representatives. The Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to provide written notice to CEDC of any use or disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of this Agreement of which Recipient is aware, including without limitation written details regarding the circumstances and the identity of the individuals or entities who as a result received or may have received access to such Confidential Information.
3. Certain Rights and Limitations.
3.1 The parties hereto are independent of one another and this Agreement does not create any agency, partnership or similar relationship between the parties hereto. CEDC acknowledges that neither the Recipient nor any of its affiliates, nor its or their Representatives, will be deemed to have made any representation or warranty or commitment with respect to the Purpose except as may be set forth in one or more final, legally binding definitive agreements. Except as otherwise provided by CEDC, the Recipient (i) acknowledges that neither CEDC nor any of its Representatives make any representation or warranty hereunder, either express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information, provided, however, that CEDC, the CEDC Group and any of their Representatives shall use good faith efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information furnished to Recipient hereunder is true, accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge, and (ii) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law that in the absence of fraud or willful misconduct on their part neither CEDC nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives on any basis (including, without limitation, in contract, tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) as a result of the review by the Recipient or its Representatives or the use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or its Representatives in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
3.2 The Recipient agrees that, upon written request by CEDC, all Confidential Information (and all copies, summaries and notes of the contents or parts thereof) and all Company property received by the Recipient shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, be either returned to CEDC or, to the extent technically practicable, destroyed (at the Recipient’s or its Representatives’ option), except that Recipient and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information as is required to comply with applicable law or regulation or professional standards or internal compliance requirements. The Recipient’s obligations under Section 2 hereof shall survive the return of such tangible embodiments of Confidential Information until termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Recipient nor any of its Representatives shall be required to delete electronically stored Confidential Information to the extent such deletion would be technologically impracticable or inconsistent with the archival records retention policy of the Recipient or its Representatives.
3.3 The Recipient shall not remove, obscure, overprint, deface or destroy any notice of confidentiality, copyright, trademark, logo, legend or other notices of ownership or confidentiality from any originals or copies of Confidential Information the Recipient obtains from the CEDC Group.
3.4 CEDC understands and acknowledges that the Recipient and an affiliate of the Recipient are currently reporting persons with respect to CEDC’s common stock on a Schedule 13D under the provisions of §§ 240.13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, among others, and that accordingly the Recipient and its affiliate will have ongoing disclosure obligations thereunder, which shall not be restricted or limited by this Agreement, including that this Agreement shall be disclosed and publicly filed as an amendment to such Schedule 13D.
4. Remedies. The Recipient acknowledges that a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to CEDC for which CEDC may not be adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that, in addition to all other remedies available to CEDC, including any member of the CEDC Group, in an action at law, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of the terms of this Agreement, CEDC shall, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security, be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief, including, but not limited to, specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. Each party's rights and obligations under this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to and not in limitation of such party's rights and obligations under law, equity or any other written agreement.
5. Miscellaneous.
5.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and take effect as an enforceable contract in accordance with the laws of the State of New York governing such agreements, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles thereof that would require applicability of any other law. The parties hereto agree that any dispute between them relating to this Agreement will be resolved solely in the manner set forth in clause (i) below:
(i) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the State of New York and in the Borough of Manhattan, and all appellate courts relating thereto, for the purpose of any suit, action, proceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Agreement. Service of process in connection with any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on each party hereto anywhere in the world by the same methods as are specified for the giving of notices under this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS TO THIS WAIVER.
5.2 Any notices or other correspondence (hereinafter collectively referred to as “correspondence”) required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by postage prepaid first class mail, courier or facsimile or delivered by hand to the party to whom such correspondence is required or permitted to be given hereunder, and shall be deemed sufficient upon receipt when delivered personally or by courier, overnight delivery service or confirmed facsimile, or three (3) Business Days after being deposited in the regular mail as certified or registered mail (airmail if sent internationally) with postage prepaid, if such notice is addressed to the party to be notified at such party’s address or facsimile number as set forth below:

5.3 This Agreement contains the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings whether written or oral, express or implied. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, including without limitation the heirs, executors and legal representatives of each such party. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that all members of the CEDC Group are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Except where expressly indicated otherwise, the words “written” or “in writing” shall include, but not be limited to, written or printed documents, electronic and facsimile transmissions and computer disks or tapes (whether machine or user readable). If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Upon such determination of invalidity or unenforceability, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. No amendment, modification or alteration of the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and executed by both parties hereto. A failure or delay in exercising any right in respect to this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right. Any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose given. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original for all purposes.
6. Securities Laws. The Recipient acknowledges that it is aware (and, if applicable, that its Representatives who are apprised of this matter have been advised) that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities. The Recipient agrees that, to the extent that it has actually received Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement that constitutes material non-public information, it will not trade any securities of CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the termination of this Agreement and that it will not use any Confidential Information in contravention of the United States securities laws.
7. Termination.
7.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect at all times until the earliest to occur of (i) the filing of an exchange offer, offering memorandum or disclosure statement with respect to the 2016 Notes or Convertible Notes, provided that, to the extent CEDC and the Recipient continue discussions on the terms of a Restructuring following such filing, this period shall extend until the filing of an amended exchange offer, offering memorandum or disclosure statement reflecting such discussions or (ii) 9:00 a.m. (GMT) on March 5, 2013, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (the “Termination Date”), other than with respect to the rights and obligations of CEDC and Recipient per Section 7.2 hereof.
7.2 On the Termination Date, CEDC shall publicly file a document (the “Cleansing Document”) containing all of the written and oral Confidential Information that constitutes material non-public information and that was provided by CEDC or its advisors to any of (a) the Recipient or its Representatives or (b) any holder of securities who is subject to a confidentiality agreement substantially similar to this Agreement (or to such holder’s Representatives) that was subsequently shared with the Recipient or its Representatives; provided that such Confidential Information shall not include any information only disclosed to the Recipients' advisors and specifically designated as ‘Non-Cleansing Information’ by CEDC at the time of such disclosure (such Confidential Information other than the ‘Non-Cleansing Information’ being the “Disclosure Information”). As promptly as practicable, CEDC will provide the Recipient with a draft of the Cleansing Document. The Cleansing Document shall be the offering memorandum and/or disclosure statement and/or Form 8-K or any periodic report required or permitted to be filed under the Exchange Act with the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or, if the SEC’s EDGAR filing system is not available, in such other manner that CEDC reasonably determines results in public dissemination of such information. If CEDC does not file the Cleansing Document on the Termination Date as required in accordance with this Section 7.2, then Recipient and/or its Representatives shall be entitled to disclose the Confidential Information that was provided by CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries hereunder without liability to the extent that Recipient or its Representatives reasonably believes that the information constitutes material non-public information that is required to allow it to freely trade, through the issuance of a press release or similar form of public communication, without any liability or breach under this Agreement (such an announcement, the “Recipient’s Cleansing Announcement”). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Cleansing Document filed by CEDC pursuant hereto is not in sufficient detail to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of each of the Recipients or their Representatives, the Recipients and their Representatives will be cleansed of any Confidential Information hereunder such that, following the filing of the Cleansing Document by CEDC, no Recipient shall be restricted, prevented or prohibited from trading any securities under applicable insider dealing or market abuse laws or regulations in any jurisdiction or pursuant to any other applicable laws or regulations, then the Recipients may make a Recipient’s Cleansing Announcement in the manner set forth above in this Section 7.2.

The above parties hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties” and individually as a “Party”.
WHEREAS
The Parties are willing to exchange Confidential Information in the form of certain scientific, technical and commercial information, that will include confidential and proprietary material relating to ………………… (the “Field”) and the Receiving Party may use this Confidential Information for the sole consideration of assessing whether to enter into a potential or proposed business collaboration with the Disclosing Party for the joint development of the technology ………………………… (the “Permitted Purpose”) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
IT IS AGREED as follows:
1. Definition and interpretation
In this Agreement, the following terms will have the respective meanings:
“Confidential Information” shall mean scientific, research, technical or business information pertaining to the Field, including but not limited to inventions; know-how; trade secrets; techniques; processes; designs; drawings; product designs; formulae and analysis; and any business information, including but not limited to price lists; customer lists; cost analyses; reports; surveys, market information and data.
In respect of Confidential Information disclosed in documentary form, model or any other tangible form, this shall be marked by the Disclosing Party as confidential or otherwise designated to show expressly or by necessary implication that it is imparted in confidence. Any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives orally or visually, shall be identified as such prior to disclosure and summarized in a writing provided by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days of the date of initial disclosure. In case of disagreement regarding said summary, the Receiving Party shall make any objections in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written summary.
“Disclosing Party” shall mean the Party that discloses Confidential Information directly or indirectly to the Receiving Party in relation to this Agreement.
“Receiving Party” shall mean the Party that receives the Confidential Information directly or indirectly from the Disclosing Party.
“Representatives” shall mean directors, employees, professional advisors or anyone involved with the Party in a professional or business capacity.
2. Exclusions
The obligation of confidentiality set out in this Agreement shall not apply to any Confidential Information that:
a) was known to the Receiving Party prior to such disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by documentary or other physical evidence;
b) was public knowledge at the time of such disclosure to the Receiving Party, or becomes public knowledge after such disclosure, through no action or omission by or on behalf of the Receiving Party;
c) is lawfully disclosed or made available to the Receiving Party by a third party having no obligation to the Disclosing Party to maintain the confidentiality of such information;
d) was independently developed or derived by the Receiving Party without the aid, application or use of information furnished by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by documentary or other physical evidence;
e) is disclosed with the written consent of the Disclosing Party;
f) is required to be disclosed by the order of a governmental agency or legislative body or a court of competent jurisdiction.
3. Obligations of confidentiality and non-use
The Receiving Parties undertake and agree:
a) To take proper and reasonable measures to ensure the secrecy of the Confidential Information;
b) Not to disclose, or allow it to be disclosed, in whole or in part to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party

The Parties shall use at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party normally exercises to protect its own information of like character and importance, but in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party undertakes to permit access to the Confidential Information only to its Representatives or employees who require access to such Information solely for the fulfilment of the Permitted Purpose, and furnished on a need-to-know basis and only on the condition that such persons are made aware of the terms of this Agreement and their obligations therein, along with the Disclosing Party’s rights to the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for ensuring its Representatives comply with the terms of this Agreement.
5. Return of information and property
The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is and remains the property of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving party must, at the end of this Agreement or within seven days following written instruction by the Disclosing Party to do so, return or destroy all Confidential Information in the Receiving Party's possession, custody or control. The Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of any such Confidential Information to be stored securely with its legal representative only if required for regulatory or insurance purposes, but in this event the confidentiality and non-use provisions in this Agreement remain in place with respect to such retained Confidential Information. The return or destruction of any Confidential Information will not diminish or otherwise affect any other obligations under this Agreement.
6. No implied rights
This Agreement shall not grant, nor be construed to grant any rights whatsoever beyond the scope of the Permitted Purpose of the Confidential Information to the Receiving Party. This includes, but it not limited to any license, patent or copyright. No warranty, express or implied, is given as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information provided by the Disclosing Party.
7. No obligation
This Agreement imposes no contractual obligation to any Party to enter into any separate business collaboration for the development of the Field or associated technology. The Disclosing Party is not obliged to disclose any Confidential Information to the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party shall have the right to refuse to accept any information prior to any disclosure.
8. Breach
In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the terms of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek an injunction (final or interlocutory) restraining the Receiving Party from committing a breach, or further breach, of this Agreement without the requirement to demonstrate any actual damage sustained by the Disclosing Party.
9. Integration
This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties concerning the treatment of information to which this Agreement relates. No modification of this Agreement shall be binding on either Party unless agreed in writing and signed by all the Parties.
10. Duration
This Agreement shall terminate 5 (five) years after the Effective Date (the “Termination Date”). Notwithstanding this, any Party may terminate its involvement with this Agreement by giving 30 (thirty) days written notice (registered letter with proof of receipt) to the other Parties. Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation imposed by this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information disclosed prior to termination, the obligations of non-use and non-disclosure of Confidential Information shall survive for 3 (three) years from the date of disclosure of the Confidential Information. After the term of this Agreement has ended, the Disclosing Party does not relinquish any other rights that it may have under copyright, patent, or other intellectual property laws.
11. Agreement in counterparts
This Agreement shall be executed in three identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall be deemed to constitute the same agreement when a duly authorised representative of each Party has signed all the counterparts.
12. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the Republic of Italy without regard to Italy’s conflicts of law rules. Any disputes or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the sole competence and jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts of Trieste.
13. Successor and assigns
The Parties agree that this Agreement and any subsequent amendments shall be binding on their successors in title and assigns, and undertake the necessary steps to ensure they are so bound.
14. Third parties
This Agreement does not create any right enforceable by any person not a Party to it.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made on the _________ day of _______________ 2015 between _________________________________________, a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and having its registered office at ______________________________________________________________, (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) of the one part and ALEXANDRA HEALTH PTE LTD, a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and having its registered office at 90 YISHUN CENTRAL SINGAPORE 768828 (hereinafter referred to as “AHPL”) of the other part.
WHEREAS:
(A) The parties, for their mutual benefit, may have exchanged and wish to further exchange certain information, including but not limited to, trade secrets and proprietary know-how in order that each of them may evaluate such information for the purpose of determining their respective interests in establishing a business relationship between them.
(B) The parties wish to define their rights with respect to the said information and to protect the confidentiality thereof and proprietary features contained therein.
(C) The Company acknowledges that all information or data relating to the Purpose whether in writing, orally or by any other means if disclosed (whether directly or indirectly) to a third (3rd) party without the express authorization of AHPL is highly confidential and would have a detrimental effect on the business of AHPL, and that its disclosure could not only expose AHPL to liability but also to judicial sanctions and that such disclosure might also adversely affect AHPL’s patients and under certain circumstances, disclosure by the Company could expose the Company to criminal prosecution. In consideration of being made privy to the Confidential Information, the Company hereby agrees to observe and be bound by the terms of the Agreement.
(D) The Company acknowledges that all information or data relating to Purpose also applies to any organisation/institution that is related to AHPL
(i) either by reason of AHPL directly or indirectly controlling the organisation/institution; (ii) by reason of both AHPL and organisation/institution being controlled by or under the common control of a third party; or (iii) by reason that AHPL is obliged to provide support services to that organisation/institution for any reason. In the context of corporate entities, a person “controls” the entity if it owns and controls (i) more than fifty (50) percent of whose shares or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors (or other managing authority) in the entity, or
(ii) more than fifty (50) percent of the equity interest in the entity, or (iii) is otherwise able to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person or entity whether by contract or otherwise.
NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

(i) all commercial, marketing and business information, strategic and development plans, intentions, any matter concerning AHPL, its affairs, business, operations, shareholders, directors, officers, business associates, clients or any other person or entity having dealings with AHPL;
(ii) information relating to the financial condition of AHPL, its accounts, audited or otherwise, notes, memoranda, documents and/or records in any form whatsoever, whether electronic or otherwise; and
(iii) scientific, technical, intellectual or other information in any form whatsoever, whether electronic or otherwise, relating to methods, processes, formulae, compositions, systems, techniques, product information, inventions, know-how, trade secrets, design rights, machines, computer programs, software, development codes and research projects; business plans, co-developer/collaborator identities, data, business records of every nature, customer lists and client database, pricing data, project records, market reports, sources of supply, employee lists, business manuals, policies and procedures, information relating to technologies or theory and all other information which may be disclosed by AHPL to the other party which the other party may be provided access by AHPL, whether stored electronically or otherwise; all information which is deemed by AHPL to be Confidential Information or which is generated as a result of or in connection with the business of AHPL and which is not generally available to the public; and all copies, reproductions and extracts thereof, in any format or manner of storage, whether in whole or in part, together with any other property of AHPL made or acquired by the other party or coming into their possession or control in any manner whatsoever.
(b) All information as stated in Clause 1.2(a) above shall be and remain the sole property of the Discloser and shall be returned to the Discloser forthwith on demand at any time or without demand upon the termination of the other party's services.
(c) The Company shall ensure that none of the patients of AHPL can be identified in any reports, submissions and publications of the Company, which shall be deemed to be Confidential information of AHPL within the meaning of this clause. Confidential Information does not include information:
(i) which is or becomes public knowledge and public property in any way without breach of this Agreement by the Recipient;
(ii) which the Recipient can show has been known or has been developed by or for the Recipient at any time independently of the information disclosed to it by the Discloser;
(iii) which is hereafter disclosed or made available to the Recipient from a source other than the Discloser without breach by the Recipient or such source of any obligation of confidentiality or non-use towards the Discloser;
(iv) which is hereafter made generally available by the Discloser or a third party or is disclosed by the Discloser to a third party without restriction on disclosure or use, including without limitation, by way of the publication of a patent specification;
(v) which is disclosed orally unless it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and confirmed as such in writing by the Discloser within thirty (30) days of disclosure;
(vi) which is disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written approval of the Discloser; or
(vii) in respect of which a period of five (5) years has elapsed from the date of signature of this Agreement
PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT the foregoing exceptions shall not apply to information relating to any combination of features or any combination of items of information merely because information relating to one or more of the relevant individual features or one or more of the relevant items (but not the combination itself) falls within any one or more of such exceptions.
1.3 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, any information relating or pertaining to the patients of AHPL shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of AHPL.
2. HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
2.1 In consideration of the mutual exchange and disclosure of Confidential Information, each party undertakes in relation to the other party's Confidential Information:
(a) to maintain the same in confidence and to use it only for the Purpose and for no other purpose and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing:
(i) not to make any commercial use thereof;
(ii) not to use the same for the benefit of itself or of any third (3rd) party other than pursuant to a further agreement with the other party; and
(iii) not to use the same for the purpose of guiding or conducting a search of any information, materials or sources, whether or not available to the public, for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation, for the purpose of demonstrating that any information falls within one (1) of the exceptions in Clause 1;
(b) not to copy, reproduce or reduce to writing any part thereof except as may be reasonably necessary for the Purpose and that any copies, reproductions or reductions to writing so made shall be the property of the Discloser;

(ii) the Recipient shall enforce such obligations at its expense and at the request of the Discloser in so far as breach thereof relates to the Discloser's Confidential Information;
(d) to be responsible for the performance of sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) above on the part of its employees or directors to whom the same is disclosed pursuant to sub-clause (c) above; and
(e) to apply thereto no lesser security measures and degree of care than those which the Recipient applies to its own confidential or proprietary information of similar nature and which the Recipient warrants as providing adequate protection of such information from unauthorised disclosure, copying or use.
2.2 The Company shall cause its directors, agents, employees, servants, officers, representatives, consultants, independent contractors and professional advisors involved in the Purpose to observe or be similarly bound by the terms of Agreement. The Company as the principal party shall be responsible and held liable for any breach of this Agreement by any of its directors, agents, employees, servants, officers, representatives, consultants, independent contractors and professional advisors.
2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient shall be entitled to make any disclosure required by law of the other party's Confidential Information, but shall give the other party not less than two (2) business days' notice of such disclosure and shall consult with the Discloser prior to such disclosure with a view to avoiding such disclosure if legally possible.
3. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
Each party shall:
(a) within one (1) month of completion of the purpose or receipt of a written request from the other party, return to the other party all documents and materials (and all copies thereof) containing the other party's Confidential Information and certify in writing to the other party that it has complied with the requirements of this sub-clause; and
(b) notwithstanding the completion of the Purpose or return of the documents and materials as aforesaid, continue to be bound by the undertakings set out in Clause 2.
4. DATA PROTECTION

4.2 The Company shall take all reasonable precautions and adequate measures to preserve the integrity and prevent any corruption or loss, damage or destruction of AHPL’s data.
4.3 In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Company shall when directed to do so by AHPL, and instruct all its agents and sub-contractors to erase all data provided by AHPL and all copies of any part of the data provided by AHPL from the Company’s systems and magnetic data.

Upon completion of this Agreement, the data will be either returned to AHPL or disposed of under the Company’s supervision in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, and the written instructions of AHPL.

7. DAMAGES NOT AN ADEQUATE REMEDY
The Recipient and Discloser both acknowledge that the Confidential Information has been developed or obtained by one another through the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that such Confidential Information provides the other with a significant competitive advantage over its competitors. The Recipient and Discloser both understand and agree that any breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to the Discloser and because of the unique nature of the Confidential Information, monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy in the event of such a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

13.2 Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in the event of such deletion, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith in order to agree to terms of mutually acceptable and satisfactory alternative provisions in place of the provision(s) so deleted.
14. WAIVER
14.1 No waiver of any breach of any covenant, condition, stipulation, obligation or provision contained or implied in this Agreement shall operate or be interpreted as a waiver of another breach of the same or of any covenant, condition, stipulation, obligation or provision in this Agreement.
14.2 Any time or other indulgence granted by AHPL under this Agreement shall be without prejudice to and shall not be taken as a waiver of any of AHPL’s rights under this Agreement nor shall it prejudice or in any way limit or affect any statutory rights or powers from time to time vested in or exercisable by AHPL.

Both parties shall always act in good faith and co-operate with each other to resolve any disputes.
15.2 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if the dispute is not settled in accordance with Clause 14.1 above, no party shall proceed to litigation or any other form of dispute resolution unless the parties have made reasonable efforts to resolve the same through mediation in accordance with the mediation rules of the Singapore Mediation Centre. A party who receives a notice for mediation from the other party shall consent and participate in the mediation process in accordance with this clause. Failure to comply with this clause shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.

Such arbitration shall be conducted in the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause, except in so far as such Rules conflict with the provisions of Clause 14 herein, in which event the provisions of Clause 14 herein will prevail.

15.9 Interest at the annual rate of six per cent (6%) per annum will be due and payable to the party in receipt of an arbitration award from such date as the arbitral tribunal may decide until the date of payment to such party.
15.10 The parties hereto undertake to keep the arbitration proceedings and all information, pleadings, documents, evidence and all matters relating thereto confidential.
15.11 The application of Part II of the International Arbitration Act, and the Model Law referred thereto, to this Agreement is hereby excluded.
15.12 For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that nothing in Clause 14 shall prevent a party from seeking urgent equitable relief before any appropriate court and the commencement of any dispute resolution proceedings shall in no way affect the continual performance of the parties’ obligations under this Agreement.
16. PROFESSIONAL FEES
In any suit or other proceeding relating to the subject matter of the Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all reasonable costs, fees and expenses by accountants, solicitors and other professionals for services rendered to the prevailing party in connection with the suit or other proceeding, including costs, fees and expenses of preparation and appeal.

This Agreement refers to the transportation data challenge posted on the BPS website that will take place between April 1st, 2017 and June 30, 2017. This event is described in greater detail in the Transportation Challenge Overview document available on the BPS website, http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge.
WHEREAS the parties wish to confirm their understandings with respect to the nature of the relationship between the parties relating to the confidential transmission, use and protection of certain student routing information,
WHEREAS BPS has authorized only the VENDOR and its employees and/or representatives to have access to certain directory, student, and routing information for portions of the year 2017 for the purpose of supporting BPS in improving our routing calculations and supporting the creation of more equitably and efficiently balanced school bell times,
WHEREAS, VENDOR and its employees and/or representatives have agreed and understand that BPS will provide only to VENDOR certain directory, student, and routing information subject to the terms of this Agreement,
WHEREAS, BPS deems this work to be of interest and value to BPS, as it will contribute toward the educational and professional goals of BPS, and
WHEREAS, VENDOR and BPS desire to cooperate with each other in connection with provision of such a solution.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, VENDOR and BPS agree as follows:
A. DEFINITIONS
Vendor and its employees and/or representatives. Any individual person or organization who is identified to receive and utilize the confidential information applicable to the related Challenge, whether as an employee or representative, must be disclosed to and approved by BPS and sign this agreement prior to commencing work on or engaging in participation in the Transportation Data Challenge. BPS reserves the right to request proof or copies of any and all signed agreements by any vendor and its employees or representatives at any time, for any reason.
Confidential Information. VENDOR acknowledges that in the course of providing services to BPS and its students, only VENDOR and its employees or representatives will be given or have access to certain directory, routing, and confidential student information (“Confidential Information”) which may typically protected from disclosure with or without prior consent by various laws including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 20 U.S.C. § 1232g et seq., 34 C.F.R. § 99 et seq., and 603 C.M.R. 23.00 et seq. VENDOR acknowledges and agrees to comply fully with these federal and state privacy and student record confidentiality laws. VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives, hold the Confidential Information in trust for BPS’s benefit, and shall, in addition to their respective obligations hereunder, use best efforts at all times to adopt and follow procedures and practices to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and prevent its disclosure to others without the express written consent of BPS. VENDOR further acknowledges that BPS’s willingness to disclose Confidential Information to VENDOR is predicated on VENDOR entering into and committing to abide fully by the terms of this Agreement and applicable laws and regulations.
Data Set. The data set includes all City of Boston students eligible for school bus transportation from the Boston Public Schools. In this dataset, specific student information has been changed slightly to protect student confidentiality.
Routing Information. The district will share the data below, along with potentially other data as may be deemed necessary and helpful. Specifically:
1. Student home location:
a. Address
b. Latitude and Longitude
2. Student characteristics:
a. School assignment

c. Grade
3. Bus Stop Location:
a. Corner intersection
b. Latitude and Longitude
4. Survey data relating to school preferences on start time
Of note, Vendors will not be provided with the students’ corresponding names, or other non-directory information that would require consent pursuant to 603 C.M.R. 23.00.
B. TERMS OF AGREEMENT
1. Data Sharing. VENDOR shall maintain and administer a secure database (“the Database”) for delivery and evaluation of information, and reporting purposes. VENDOR will use a secure database for managing and sharing routing data. The Database will meet government data management and security protocols and will incorporate security features within the platform to ensure privacy and confidentiality is maintained while providing the Parties the key information they require to understand impact. The VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives shall be responsible for transmitting all data or other record of all data requested and received pursuant to the Agreement, including confirmation of the return or destruction of data as described herein.
Reasonable security precautions and protections include, but are not limited to:
a) Creating, distributing, and implementing data governance policies and procedures which protect Confidential Information through appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security safeguards, and outline staff responsibilities for maintaining data security.
b) Potentially encrypting all Confidential Information carried on mobile/ computers/electronic/devices.
c) Potentially encrypting Confidential Information before it is transmitted electronically.
d) Requiring that users be uniquely identified and authenticated before accessing Confidential Information.
e) Establishing and enforcing well-defined data privilege rights which restrict users’ access to the Confidential Information necessary for them to perform their job functions.
f) Ensuring that all persons accessing Confidential Information sign a confidentiality agreement, and maintaining copies of signed agreements.
g) Securing access to any physical areas/electronic devices where sensitive data are stored.
h) Installing a firewall to permit or deny network transmissions based upon a set of rules.
i) Installing anti-virus software to protect the network.
2. Nondisclosure. Nothing in this Agreement may be construed to allow any Party to maintain, use, disclose, or share Confidential Information in a manner not allowed under federal or state law or regulation, or outside the scope of this agreement. Authorized vendors shall strictly comply with all federal and state laws that apply to the use and release of Confidential Information, including but not limited to FERPA and its regulations, set forth at 34 C.F.R. § 99. VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives, shall use the Confidential Information and routing data solely in connection with performance by VENDOR of the services provided to BPS as outline by this agreement and pursuant to the Challenge Document and for no other purpose. Neither VENDOR nor any of its employees and/or representatives, shall sell, release, transfer, reprint, duplicate, recreate, disclose or permit the disclosure to any other person or entity of any of the Confidential Information or of any files, compilation, study, report or analysis or data base containing, based on or derived from the Confidential Information without the express written consent of BPS, and in full compliance with applicable state and federal privacy laws. VENDOR shall maintain the privacy of protected personal information and shall be financially responsible, if and to the extent that any security breach relating to protected personal information results from acts or omissions of VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives for any notifications to affected persons (after prompt consultation with BPS), and to the extent requested by BPS, administratively responsible for such notification. VENDOR shall protect the Confidential Information and shall not permit the release of such information to parties other than BPS officials and their authorized agents.
3. Background Checks: VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives, acknowledge that BPS reserves the right to conduct an appropriate background check on any and all participants with access to the Confidential Information pursuant to this agreement.
4. Disclosure Sought Under Legal Process. VENDOR shall immediately notify BPS (see below) in writing of any subpoena, court order or other legal process seeking or purporting to compel disclosure of any of the Confidential Information and shall challenge, oppose or appeal any such subpoena, order or legal process to the extent deemed appropriate by BPS. In no event shall VENDOR voluntarily, without a court order, disclose or permit the disclosure of any of the Confidential Information in response to legal process unless and until VENDOR has given the required notice to BPS and VENDOR has exhausted any and all legal remedies available to it to limit or prevent the disclosure.
5. Notices: The following BPS representative shall be notified of any occurrence outlined in this agreement that so requires:
Name: William Eger
Title: Strategic Projects Manager
Email: weger@bostonpublicschools.org

Roxbury, MA 02119
6. Return or Destruction of Materials. Upon request of BPS at any time, VENDOR shall return all or such part of the Confidential Information as BPS may designate to be returned. In addition, upon the completion of the services provided by VENDOR to BPS as outlined in this Agreement, VENDOR shall return or destroy, as BPS may instruct, all Confidential Information in VENDOR’S possession or control, whether in printed, electronic or any other format, including all duplicates and copies thereof of any files, compilation, study, report, analysis or data base containing, based on or derived from the Confidential Information.
7. Publication. BPS has the right to report, present, publish, or otherwise use data to which it has produced or received from VENDOR. Acceptable disclosure includes, but is not limited to, disclosure of aggregate or de-identified data in reports and presentations, including for grant reporting purposes, disclosure of aggregate or de-identified data to VENDOR, public entities and community based organizations, and use of aggregate or de-identified data in program planning, evaluation and research not related to the BPI initiative. VENDOR shall not publish, present, or use reports without explicit written consent from BPS. BPS has the right to review and require approval of any publicly reported document prior to its release.
8. Disclosure, Breach & Penalties. VENDOR’S disclosure of Confidential Information to third parties without BPS's authorization, or VENDOR’S failure to sign or comply with this agreement or return or destroy Confidential Information per Provision 4 above, may constitute a breach of this Agreement and may result in the BPS or the U.S. Department of Education denying VENDOR access to Confidential Information and other such penalties as dictated by law or equity.
9. Injunctive Relief. VENDOR acknowledges and agrees that the breach or threatened breach by VENDOR, or its employees and/or representatives of their obligations under this Agreement will cause serious and irreparable harm to BPS that cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and that BPS may seek injunctive relief from an appropriate court to protect BPS from such harm without necessity of bond or other security.
10. Immediate Notice. VENDOR shall give BPS immediate written and verbal notice of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information, or of any breach or threatened breach by VENDOR or its employees and/or representatives of their obligations under this Agreement, upon learning of same.
11. Appropriate Forum. VENDOR and BPS agree that this Agreement is entered into in the State of Massachusetts, and that the courts located in the State of Massachusetts are the appropriate forum in the event any party seeks legal action or injunctive relief under this Agreement. All parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in the appropriate court in the State of Massachusetts.
12. Termination. BPS may terminate this agreement with VENDOR at any time, for any reason, with either written or verbal notice. VENDOR must give the designated BPS representative 3-day written and verbal notice of any termination of this agreement with BPS. Termination of this Agreement, however, does not affect any Party’s obligations, duties or rights imposed or granted by separate instrument such as a grant or other contract.
13. Indemnification. Unless otherwise exempted by law, VENDOR shall indemnify and hold harmless the City of Boston, Boston Public Schools, and its Departments, agents, officers, and employees against any and all claims, liabilities, and costs for damages that the City may sustain which arise out of or in connection with VENDOR’S performance of this Agreement, including but not limited to the negligent, reckless or intentional conduct of VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives, officers, or other related personnel. After prompt notification of a claim by the City, VENDOR shall have an opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim and any negotiated settlement agreement or judgment. The City and its departments shall not be liable for any costs incurred by VENDOR arising under this paragraph. Any indemnification of VENDOR shall be subject to appropriation and applicable law. Indemnification specifically includes, but is not limited to, claims related to (i) the indemnifying Party’s improper sharing of data, (ii) improper use of data by the indemnifying Party or any of the indemnifying Party’s employees, agents, officers, volunteers, or other related personnel, or (iii) breach of the indemnifying Party’s IT system.
14. Relationship of Parties. The VENDOR, its employees, and/or representatives shall not be construed, deemed or otherwise held to be employees, agents, or officers of BPS. VENDOR and its employees and/or representatives shall not be entitled to compensation or other benefits that ordinarily accrue to employees of BPS. Nothing herein shall create or be deemed to create any relationship of agency, association, joint venture, partnership as defined by law, or employer/employee between BPS and VENDOR or its employees or representatives.

C. CPR and Supplier agree to protect each of its respective Confidential Information, as defined hereunder, and both parties agree that disclosure and use of the other party’s Confidential Information shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this CNDA.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises and the covenants and agreements set forth in this CNDA and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION
1.01 Definitions
Definitions can be found at URL: http://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/selling-to-cp/information-technology/definitions

For all purposes of this CNDA, except as otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) all references in this CNDA to designated sections, paragraphs or other subdivisions are to the designated sections, paragraphs or other subdivisions of this CNDA;
(b) within the CNDA the words “herein,” “hereof” and “hereunder” and other words of similar import refer to this CNDA as a whole and not to any particular section, paragraph or other subdivision;
(c) the headings used herein are for convenience only and do not form a part of this CNDA, nor are they intended to interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this CNDA or any of its provisions;
(d) the word “including” when following any general statement, term or matter, shall not be construed to limit such general statement, term or matter to the specific items or matters set forth immediately following such word or to similar items or matters, whether or not non-limiting language (such as “without limitation” or “but not limited to” or words of similar import) is used with reference thereto but rather shall be deemed to refer to all other items or matters that could reasonably fall within the broadest possible scope of such general statement, term or matter;
(e) any reference to any entity shall include and shall be deemed to be a reference to any entity that is a successor to such entity; and
(f) words importing gender include all genders and words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa.
ARTICLE 2- CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
2.01 Confidential Information
""Confidential Information"" means, subject to section 2.02 below any additional information requested by the Supplier and provided by CPR, or any information supplied by either party that is clearly marked “Confidential” or clearly intended to be disclosed in confidence.
2.02 Not Confidential Information
The following shall not, for the purposes of this CNDA, constitute Confidential Information:
(a) information relating to the Disclosing Party that is obtained or was previously obtained by the Receiving Party from a third Person who, insofar as is known to the Receiving Party after reasonable inquiry, is not obligated to keep such information confidential;
(b) information already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure, as shown by prior written evidence or other evidence satisfactory to the Disclosing Party;
(c) information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party’s violation of this CNDA; and
(d) information that the Disclosing Party authorizes the Receiving Party to disclose.
2.03 Kept in Confidence
The Receiving Party agrees to use the same degree of care to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information received by it as the Receiving Party uses to prevent disclosure of its own confidential information, but in no case less than a reasonable degree of care. In addition, except as set forth in section 2.06, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, neither the Receiving Party nor its Representatives will disclose to any other Person the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts relating to the Parties’ business relationship.
2.04 No Benefit, Restricted Use
The Receiving Party shall not, in any manner, derive any benefit, directly or indirectly, from the Confidential Information or the use of such Confidential Information, for any purpose. The Receiving Party agrees not to appropriate for his or her own use or exploit in any way whatsoever any of the Confidential Information disclosed to it by the Disclosing Party.
2.05 No Disclosure
Except as set forth in Section 2.06, the Receiving Party shall not disclose any of the Confidential Information or other facts directly related to the Confidential Information to any Person other than its Representatives who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will also ensure that its Representatives comply with the terms of this CNDA.
2.06 Disclosure Required by Law
The Receiving Party will not disclose to any Person the Confidential Information or other facts directly related to the Confidential Information unless, in the reasonable opinion of the Receiving Party’s legal counsel, disclosure is required by legal process or regulatory demands, in which event the Receiving Party will, prior to such disclosure, promptly provide the Disclosing Party with written notice of the intended disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate protection.
2.07 Return of Confidential Information
Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information in its possession or control, and promptly destroy or erase all notes, memoranda and other material prepared by the Receiving Party which reflect, interpret, evaluate, include or are derived from any Confidential Information and the Receiving Party shall certify such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party.
2.08 Responsibility for Others
The Receiving Party agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach of this CNDA by any of its Representatives.
ARTICLE 3 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
3.01 Remedies
The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that it has entered into this CNDA on the understanding that any breach hereof by it will cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm and expressly agrees that, in addition to all other remedies that the Disclosing Party may be entitled to as a matter of law, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to specific performance and any form of equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this CNDA.
3.02 Continuing Obligations Regarding Confidentiality
The obligations of confidentiality contained herein shall survive the expiration or termination of the Contract, SOW, Amendments, or RFP Terms.
3.03 Notices
All disclosures, notices or other documents required or permitted to be given pursuant to this CNDA shall be in writing and delivered by hand or courier service or by fax to the address
(a) of the Supplier to the address provided by the Supplier with its request for additional information or to such other address as may be provided from time to time:
(b) CPR
Address: Attn: Office of the CIO
Canadian Pacific Railway
Building 1, 7550 Ogden Dale Road
Calgary, Alberta T2C 4X9
3.04 Entire Agreement
This CNDA, in respect of additional information, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous discussions, understandings and negotiations and it is agreed between the parties that there are no oral statements, representations, warranties, undertakings or agreements between the Parties modifying the provisions of this CNDA.
3.05 Amendments
This CNDA shall not be amended except if in writing and signed by the Parties.
3.06 Offer and Acceptance
This CNDA shall be deemed offered upon a request by the Supplier for additional information and shall be deemed accepted upon CPR providing the requested additional information. No physical execution of this CNDA is required or expected.
3.07 Provisions Severable
If any provision of this CNDA is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, such provision shall be deemed to be independent and severable from the remaining provisions of this CNDA, and the remaining provisions of this CNDA shall not be affected and shall be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by law.
3.08 Binding Nature of Agreement
This CNDA shall enure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the Parties hereto together with their respective heirs, legal personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns. No Party hereto shall assign in whole or in part its rights or obligations under this CNDA without the express written consent of the other Party.
3.09 Termination
This agreement continues in effect for three years. Either party may terminate this CNDA for any reason by providing the other with 30 days’ advance written notice. The termination of this CNDA, or the completion or abandonment of the Permitted Purpose, shall not affect the survival of the non-disclosure obligations under this CNDA, which obligations shall survive for a period of 3 years.
3.09 Governing Law
This CNDA shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the Parties shall be governed by, the laws of the Province of Alberta. The Parties irrevocably submit and attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Alberta for all matters arising out of or relating to this CNDA, or any of the transactions contemplated herein.
3.10 No Implied Waiver
The failure by any Party at any time to require performance by the other Party of any provision of this CNDA shall in no way affect the right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of any breach of any provision of this CNDA constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same
3.11 Residuals
Notwithstanding the confidentiality obligations contained in Article 2 hereof, the receiving party may, during and after the term hereof, use in its business any Residual Information. “Residual Information” means the ideas, know-how and techniques that would be retained in the unaided memory of an ordinary person skilled in the art, not intent on appropriating the proprietary information of the disclosing party, as a result of such person’s access to, use, review, evaluation, or testing of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party for the purposes described herein. An employee's memory is unaided if the employee has not intentionally memorized the confidential information for the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing it. Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be deemed to grant to the receiving party a license under the disclosing party’s intellectual property rights
3.12 No Implied Partnership
This CNDA is intended to provide for the protection of the Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure and use, and does not constitute an agreement to cooperate in a joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement, or for CP to retain Supplier in respect of any particular project. Additionally, nothing in this CNDA constitutes a warranty by the Disclosing Party of the accuracy of any Confidential Information.
3.13 Language Laws
The parties have requested and agreed that these terms and conditions be drafted in the English language. Les parties reconnaissent qu’elles ont exigé que la présente convention soit rédigée en langue anglaise seulement.
In Witness whereof the parties have executed this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement by its respective duly appointed officer.

The obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall continue and survive the Transmission Functions for which the Confidential Information was disclosed and shall remain binding under this Agreement unless disclosure is permitted under Section 8 or required by Law or Authority. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the term of protection of Confidential Information otherwise protected by Law or Authority.
11. Disclaimer of Warranties. Each Party hereby disclaims and does not make any express or implied representation or warranty concerning the accuracy or completeness of Confidential Information and no Disclosing Party shall have liability to the Party for the Party’s use of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. In addition, nothing in this Agreement requires the disclosure of Confidential Information or supersedes the discretion of the Disclosing Party. In addition, nothing in this Agreement requires the disclosure of Confidential Information or supersedes the discretion of the Disclosing Party to determine the extent of the Confidential Information disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information of any nature shall not obligate the Disclosing Party to disclose any further Confidential Information.
12. No License. No license to the Party, under any trademark, patent copyright, mask work protection right or any other intellectual property right, is either granted or implied by the conveying of Confidential Information to such Party. None of the Confidential Information which may be disclosed by a Disclosing Party shall constitute any representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee or inducement by such Disclosing Party to any other Party of any kind, and, in particular, with respect to the non-infringement of trademarks, patents, copyrights, or any other intellectual property rights, or other rights of third persons.
13. No Implied Agreement. Except as provided herein, no Party shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever by virtue of this Agreement.

15. Miscellaneous.
a. Binding Effect. The obligations of the Parties shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of their respective heirs, successors, assigns, and affiliates.
b. Integration. This Agreement constitutes the Parties’ entire agreement concerning the subject matter hereof and may be amended or modified only by a subsequent agreement in writing. A waiver, discharge, amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof, shall be valid and effective only if in writing and executed by all Parties. A written waiver of a right, remedy or obligation under a provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of the provision itself, a waiver of any succeeding right, remedy or obligation under the provision, or a waiver of any other right, remedy, or obligation under this Agreement. Any delay or failure by a Party in enforcing any obligation or in exercising any right or remedy shall not operate as a waiver of it or affect that party’s right later to enforce the obligation or exercise the right or remedy and a single or partial exercise of a right of remedy by a Party does not preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right or remedy of that Party.
c. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by an Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any respect or with respect to Confidential Information, such provision in all other respects or with respect to all other Confidential Information, as the case may be, and the remaining provisions with respect to all Confidential Information, shall nevertheless continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated and shall be enforced to the full extent permitted by Law.

A validly given notice, consent or approval will be effective when received if delivered.
f. No Assignment. Each Party recognizes that breach of its obligations hereunder shall cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party and agrees that in the event of breach, the Disclosing Party shall have in addition to any and all remedies at Law, the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief. A party’s liability for breach of this Agreement shall be limited to the dollar amount of any direct damages caused by gross negligence, intentional or deliberate misconduct of such Party or of its Reviewing Representative.

8. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
9. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts by any of the signatories hereto and as so executed shall constitute one agreement.
10. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, between the Parties with regard to the subject matter hereof.

1. Recipient may be provided with access to selected information (oral, written, or electronic) of the other (including of any of the Corporations) which helps meet a regulatory purpose or business need, including, but not limited to, that information which relates or refers to: business planning; internal controls; computer, data processing, or communications architectures or systems; electronic data processing architectures, applications, programs, routines, or subroutines; business affairs and methods of operation or proposed methods of operations, techniques or systems of a party (including of any of the Corporations) or any customer of a party (including of any of the Corporations); financial or other non-public information. Some of the information in each of these categories is confidential in nature or constitutes a trade secret. This information received from a party (including of any of the Corporations), either orally or in writing, during the course of the Project shall be deemed to be confidential information (Confidential Information) for purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement. Notes, documents, summaries or reports which are prepared from Confidential Information to the extent such specifically refer or relate to Confidential Information are themselves Confidential Information.
2. Recipient acknowledges the sensitive and secret nature of the Confidential Information it will have access to during the term of this Agreement and agrees that it will treat such Confidential Information as strictly confidential and shall exercise the same degree of care in the protection of the Confidential Information as the Recipient exercises with respect to its own proprietary property and trade secrets, but in no event shall it be less than a reasonable degree of care given the nature of the Confidential Information.
3. Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information to any person or entity, except its employees or partners involved in the Project, or to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations under the Project. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by Recipient and/or anyone employed by or otherwise associated with Recipient may also constitute a violation of the Insider Trading Act and/or other securities and other laws. Access to or disclosure of Confidential Information by Recipient shall be limited to those employees or partners covered by a then effective legal obligation or agreement with Recipient that prohibits the disclosure or unauthorized use of confidential information deemed confidential by Recipient (Authorized Employees). The existence of such an agreement with an employee or partner of the Recipient shall not operate to relieve the Recipient from liability for acts of such employee or partner that result in a breach of this Confidentiality Agreement.
4. Recipient shall not make copies of the Confidential Information except for those copies required for use by Authorized Employees in the performance of the Agreement. Each copy, including its storage media, shall be marked Confidential, and also include all copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices which appear on the original. The Recipient agrees that all Confidential Information, including any copies thereof, shall be returned to NASDAQ OMX or destroyed within ten (10) days of the expiration or other termination of the Project.
5. Notes and other documents referencing or relating to Confidential Information may be made and kept by the Recipient, but shall continue to be governed by this Confidentiality Agreement until they are destroyed.
6. All intellectual property rights associated with the Confidential Information, including without limitation, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret rights, and moral rights shall remain in NASDAQ OMX.
7. The obligation of non-disclosure shall not extend to: (1) information which is then already in the possession of the Recipient and not under a duty of non-disclosure; (2) information which is generally known or revealed to the public other than by breach of this Agreement; (3) information which is revealed to the Recipient by a third party--unless such party is under a duty of non-disclosure; or (4) information which the Recipient develops independently of the disclosure as indicated by files existing at the time of initial disclosure.
8. In the event Recipient receives a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Confidential Information, Recipient shall provide prompt actual notice to the General Counsel of NASDAQ OMX of such receipt, providing the Corporations with a reasonable opportunity to intervene in the proceeding before the time that Recipient is required to comply with such subpoena or other process. In the event that NASDAQ OMX instructs Recipient not to comply with any portion or all of the process, Recipient shall comply with such instructions and NASDAQ OMX shall indemnify and hold harmless the Recipient from any damages to the extent that Recipient's damages result from its compliance with NASDAQ OMX's instructions.
9. Recipient acknowledges that NASDAQ OMX, because of the nature of the Confidential Information, would suffer irreparable harm in the event of a material breach of the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement in that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate NASDAQ OMX for such a breach, and that in the event of any material breach or threatened material breach by the Recipient of any such provisions, NASDAQ OMX shall be entitled, in addition to such other legal or equitable remedies which might be available, to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction against the threatened material breach or continuation of any such material breach without showing or proving any actual damages sustained by NASDAQ OMX. If NASDAQ OMX prevails in any action brought to enjoin a material breach or threatened breach of this Confidentiality Agreement, it shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in connection with such legal proceeding. This Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.
10. The representations and obligations of the Recipient relative to the Confidential Information shall survive the termination of this Confidentiality Agreement for a period up to three (3) years from the date of the completion or other termination of the Project.
11. This Confidentiality Agreement contains the full and complete understanding of Recipient and NASDAQ OMX with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior representations and understandings whether they be oral or written.
12. Recipient and NASDAQ OMX understand and agree that in the event any part, term or provision of this Confidentiality Agreement is held to be invalid or legally unenforceable, the validity of the remaining parts, terms or provisions shall not be affected, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Confidentiality Agreement did not contain the particular part, term, or provision held to be invalid.
13. The persons executing this Confidentiality Agreement warrant that they have the authority to bind NASDAQ OMX and the Recipient to the terms and conditions embodied in this Confidentiality Agreement.

"CONFIDENTIALITY OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
1. This Non-Disclosure Agreement is entered into by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and __________________________________, ___________________________________ on _______________. (Name of Contractor) (Name of Contracting Company) (mm/dd/yyyy)
VA and the contractor have entered into a contract, _________________________________________________ (Enter identifying information on contract) ___________________________________________________________________________________________ under which the contractor will _________________________________________________________________ (Enter task that the contractor will perform) ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________.
2. In order to perform this contract, the contractor will need access to VA data, software, and computer systems either at a VA location, at the contractor's place of business, or both, in accordance with the contract.
3. By signing this agreement, the contractor acknowledges and understands the following:
a. The contractor and any subcontractor(s) shall presume that the VA computer systems and storage media that the contractor or subcontractor access have sensitive information and applications, the modification or disclosure of which could cause significant harm or embarrassment to VA beneficiaries and employees and to VA's ability to perform its mission. If the security requirements for accessing, handling, and storing VA data and systems are specified in the contract, the contractor will comply with the contractual security requirements. If the contract does not contain the requirements, the contractor will handle the VA property with the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized access, use, dissemination, publication, or destruction that the contractor uses to protect its own sensitive information and systems.
b. Any VA information, software, applications, computer systems, and hardware accessed by the contractor in the performance of the contract remain the sole property of VA.
c. To the extent that any software or applications on the VA systems are protected by copyright, the contractor agrees that it will not copy or disclose them without first obtaining VA's prior written authorization, which will be provided only where authorized under applicable copyright law.
d. The contractor, the contractor's employees, and any subcontractor and subcontractor's employees will access the VA information, software, applications, computer systems, and hardware which VA provides, or provides access to, only to the extent necessary, and only for the purpose of performing the contract. The contractor will take reasonable steps to ensure that it will allow only those contractor and subcontractor employees who need to see the VA materials in order to perform the contract to do so. However, this agreement also applies to any other VA systems or data to which the contractor may have access to or be disclosed to the contractor.
e. The contractor will not authorize anyone else to access, disclose, modify, or destroy the information, software or applications on the VA systems provided or accessed under this contract without VA's prior written authorization.
f. The contractor and its employees shall not make any copies of any VA information, including software or applications that are not copyrighted, except as necessary to restore VA computer systems or data storage devices to an operating state. Any copies made by the contractor or subcontractor shall be identified as VA property and handled as sensitive information under this non-disclosure agreement.
g. Any information that the contractor and its employees learns about VA data and VA computer systems shall not be recorded except to the extent necessary to perform the contract, and such information, whether recorded or not, shall be handled as sensitive information under this agreement. The contractor may not use or disclose it except as the contractor is permitted to use or disclose VA sensitive information under the contract and this nondisclosure agreement.
h. The contractor may disclose VA sensitive information to persons other than in the performance of this contract as authorized by the contract and this agreement in only two situations: (1) pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (2) with VA's prior written authorization. Prior to any disclosure pursuant to a court order, the contractor shall promptly notify VA of the court order and provide VA with a copy by fax or e-mail, whichever is faster, and notify by telephone the VA individual designated in advance to receive such notices. If the contractor cannot notify VA before being compelled to produce the information under court order, the contractor will notify VA of the disclosure as soon as practical. The notice under this provision will include the following information to the extent that the contractor knows it, if it does not show on the face of the court order: the records disclosed pursuant to the order, to whom, where, and when, for what purpose, and any other information that the contractor reasonably believes is relevant to the disclosure.
i. The contractor will refer all requests or demands for production of , or access to, VA data and systems to VA for response. The contractor will immediately inform VA by telephone, fax and/or e-mail of any access, disclosure, disposition or destruction of VA data and systems not authorized under the contract or this agreement. To the extent known, the contractor will notify VA of the information disclosed, to whom, how when, the reason for the access, disclosure, disposition or destruction, and any other information that the contractor considers relevant. VA will provide the contractor with the name, title, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the VA official whom the contractor will notify if the records are requested, sought under a court order, or if any unauthorized access, modification, disposition, or destruction of VA sensitive information or computer systems occurs.
j. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees will cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority response for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any unauthorized access, disclosure, disposition, or destruction of VA property. The contractor will also cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA property, to obtain monetary or other compensation for a third party, or to obtain injunctive relief against any third party who accessed, modified, disclosed, or destroyed VA sensitive data and computer systems except as authorized under the contract or this agreement.
k. Upon completion or termination of the contract for any reason, the contractor will immediately deliver all VA records, data, copies of VA records and data, software and equipment, and information about VA data and systems recorded or documented by the contractor, in its possession or the possession of any subcontractors, to the VA official designated in the contract or pursuant to this agreement. The contractor will not retain any copies of any of these documents.
l. All additions to, or modifications of, this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.
m. This agreement is made under, and shall be governed by, the laws of the United States.
4. SECURITY
a. Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall satisfy all requirements for appropriate security eligibility in dealing with access to sensitive information and information systems belonging to or being used on behalf of VA. To satisfy VA requirements, procedures defined in VA Directive & Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program are required.
b. The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO). Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations.
c. All costs associated with obtaining clearances for contractor provided personnel will be the responsibility of the contractor. Further, the contractor will be responsible for the actions of all individuals provided to work for VA under this contract. In the event that damages arise from work performed by contractor provided personnel, under the auspices of this contract, the contractor will be responsible for all resources necessary to remedy the incident.
5. SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTEGRITY
The contractor warrants and represents that the contractor-supplied software, other than the key software, does not and will not contain any program routine, device, code, or instructions (including any code or instructions provided by third parties) or other undisclosed feature, including, without limitation, a time bomb, virus, software lock, drop-dead device, malicious logic, worm, Trojan horse, bug, error, defect, or trap door, that is capable of accessing, modifying, deleting, damaging, disabling, deactivating, interfering with or otherwise harming the contractor software, any computers, networks, data, or other electronically stored information, or computer programs or systems (collectively, ""disabling procedures""). Such representation and warranty applies regardless of whether such disabling procedures are authorized by the contractor to be included in the contractor software.
If the contractor incorporates into the contractor software programs or routines supplied by other vendors, licensors, or contractors (other than the key software), the contractor shall obtain comparable warranties from such providers, or the contractor shall take appropriate action to ensure that such programs or routines are free of disabling procedures. Notwithstanding any other limitations in this agreement, the contractor agrees to notify VA immediately upon discovery of any disabling procedures that are or may be included in the contractor software. If disabling procedures are discovered or reasonably suspect to be present in the contractor software, the contractor, as its entire liability and VA's sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty in this section, agrees to take action immediately, at its own expense, to identify and eradicate (or to equip VA to identify and eradicate) such disabling procedures and carry out any recovery necessary to remedy any impact of such disabling procedures.
Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.246-18, Warranty of Supplies of a Complex Nature (May 2001), is hereby incorporated into VA Form 0752.
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause - ""Acceptance"" means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services rendered, as partial or complete performance of the contract. ""Supplies"" means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include ""data.""
(b) Contractor's obligations. (1) The Contractor warrants that for two years all supplies furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; provided, however, that with respect to Government-furnished property, the Contractor's warranty shall extend only to its proper installation, unless the Contractor performs some modification or other work on the property, in which case the Contractor's warranty shall extend to the modification or other work. (2) Any supplies or parts thereof corrected or furnished in replacement shall be subject to the conditions of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. This warranty shall be equal in duration to that set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies. (3) The Contractor shall not be obligated to correct or replace supplies if the facilities, tooling, drawings, or other equipment or supplies necessary to accomplish the correction or replacement have been made unavailable to the Contractor by action of the Government. In the event that correction or replacement has been directed, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the nonavailability. (4) The Contractor shall also prepare and furnish to the Government data and reports applicable to any correction required (including revision and updating of all affected data called for under this contract) at no increase in the contract price. (5) When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the place of delivery specified in the contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) to the Contractor's plant and return. (6) All implied warranties of merchant ability and ""fitness for a particular purpose"" are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract. (c) Remedies available to the Government. (1) In the event of a breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Government may, at no increase in contract price - (i) Require the Contractor, at the place of delivery specified in the contract (irrespective of the f.o. b. point or the point of acceptance) or at the Contractor's plant, to repair or replace, at the Contractor's election, defective or nonconforming suppies; or (ii) Require the Contractor to furnish at the Contractor's plant the materials or parts and installation instructions required to successfully accomplish the correction. (2) If the Contracting Officer does not require correction or replacment of defective or nonconforming supplies or the Contractor is not obligated to correct or replace under paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Government shall be entitled to an equitable reduction in the contract price. (3) The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of any breach of the warranty in paragraph (b) of this clause within 45 days after discovery of the defect or intrusion. The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written recommendation within 5 work days as to the corrective action required to remedy the breach. After the notice of breach, but not later than 10 work days after receipt of the Contractor's recommendation for corrective action, the Contracting Officer may, in writing, direct correction or replacement as in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, and the Contractor shall, notwithstanding any disagreement regarding the existence of a breach of warranty, comply with this direction. If it is later determined that the Contractor did not breach the warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the contract price will be equitably adjusted. (4) If supplies are corrected or replaced, the period for notification of a breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall be two years from the furnishing or return by the Contractor to the Government of the corrected or replaced supplies or parts thereof, or, if correction or replacement is effect by the Contractor at a Government or other activity, for two years thereafter. (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract.

2. Confidentiality and Non-Use
2.1 For the purpose of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any information received by a Party (the “Receiving Party”) regarding the other Party’s (the “Disclosing Party”) business, research, products and/or services, such as all information and technology, including without limitation, research, inventions, manufacture methods, data, designs, plans, drawings, know-how, IT systems, software, processes, schematics, blueprints, records, reports, models, prototypes and descriptions related thereto, customers, partners, as well as the terms and conditions of this Agreement and information furnished during discussions or oral presentations, whether or not designated as confidential at the time of disclosure.
2.2 Confidential Information shall not include information that:

ii. was previously known to the Receiving Party free of any obligation to keep it confidential, as evidenced by its business records;
iii. is lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party; or
iv. is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information, as evidenced by its records.
2.3 This Agreement will not be deemed to restrict either Party from complying with a lawfully issued governmental order, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other legal requirement to produce or disclose Confidential Information; provided, however, that the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party upon learning of such order or requirement.
2.4 The Parties shall only use Confidential Information for the purpose of negotiation and/or evaluation of any co-operation between the Parties. The Parties shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, other than to their officers, employees or consultants (engaged in the matter of this Agreement) on a need to know basis, without the prior written approval of the other Party.

Upon request of the Disclosing Party or upon the termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall return, delete or destroy (as instructed in writing by the Disclosing Party) all Confidential Information, and all copies thereof. The Receiving Party shall certify in writing that the information has been returned, deleted or destroyed (as applicable) and that no copies have been retained of any such Confidential Information, either partly or wholly.
4. Intellectual Property Rights
4.1 All Confidential Information (including but not limited to all intellectual property rights emanating from or related to Confidential Information) remains the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and nothing in this Agreement grants any right or license in the Confidential Information to the Receiving Party.

The provisions of this Agreement shall apply retroactively to any Confidential Information, which has been disclosed in accordance with this Agreement and in connection with discussions and negotiation regarding the possible co-operation described in this Agreement prior to the effective date of the Agreement.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement ('Agreement"") is made and entered into as of __________, 20__ (""Effective Date"") by and between ______________________________ (“Producer”) and___________________________________, (“Agency”) (each a ""Party"" and collectively referred to herein as the ""Parties"").
For purposes of this Agreement “Agency” means the undersigned Advertising Agency, “Client” means the advertiser client of the Agency identified on the signature page of this Agreement; “Commercial” means a commercial production referred to in the Producer’s bid/specification form. The term “Agency Affiliate” means (i) the wholly owned subsidiary of the Agency’s parent (“Owner”) where the Agency is also a wholly owned subsidiary (ii) which Agency Affiliate is an advertising agency and does not operate as a commercial production, post production business or acts as an in-house cost consulting entity. Agency represents that it is soliciting bona fide bids for the production of the Commercial and Producer represents that its bid, if submitted, shall be a bona fide bid. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement are inconsistent with those in Client’s or Agency’s bid/specification form, production agreement or purchase order that address the subject matter of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Agency is signing this Agreement for itself and for its Client who is also a “Party,” “Recipient” and “Discloser” under this Agreement.
Now, therefore, the Parties agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information. Each Party receiving Confidential Information (as defined below) (each, a ""Recipient,"" and together, the ""Recipients""), is receiving confidential disclosure of certain confidential or proprietary technical, business, operational, financial and/or commercial information, trade secret information and/or any information of the other designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or by similar designation, or which under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential (""Confidential Information"") for the purpose of exploring, establishing, performing or carrying out a contractual business relationship for the production by the Producer of the Commercial and/or other commercial productions for the Client (collectively and severally, the “Transaction""). Each disclosing Party (each a ""Discloser"") would not disclose its Confidential Information without the Recipient's agreement to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence and to use such Confidential Information solely as permitted under this Agreement. Confidential Information can be in any form (e.g. electronic, digital, analog, hard copy or oral). Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Party to disclose its Confidential Information.
Specifically, with respect to the Producer, the term “Confidential Information” includes confidential and proprietary information of Producer disclosed in connection with the Transaction (during each phase including pre-production, conference(s), pre-bid, bid, production, shoot, wrap and post-production) and regardless of whether a commercial production project is awarded to Producer, including, but not limited to, production costs, discounts, bids, budgets, treatments, prices, relationships with employees, independent contractors and vendors, specifications, sources, layouts, breakdowns, approach to a commercial project, financial and technical information, ideas, designs, specifications, techniques, models, data, programs, processes, technologies and methods of producing the work, all customized terms of, and attachments to, the Producer’s bid/specification form or production contract or other production documents, processes, know-how, customer lists, marketing plans, systems and reports, and information discussed by Producer at any Agency or Client meetings.
2. Non-Use and Non-Disclosure. Recipients will not disclose, distribute, copy or use any Confidential Information or the fact that a Transaction is being considered or is under a production contract without the prior written consent of the other Party and then only to the extent specified in such consent. Confidential Information may be used only to the extent reasonably required for the purposes of evaluating, producing or carrying out the Transaction; provided however, that Recipients may only disclose the Confidential Information to those of its contractors, vendors, directors, officers, advisors, agents and employees (""Representatives"") who need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating, performing or carrying out or producing the Transaction and who shall be bound by a written agreement or other legally enforceable written obligations to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives, whether or not such Representatives are associated with the Discloser at the time of the breach.
Without limiting the foregoing, where the Discloser is the Producer and a Recipient Representative is a cost consultant of the Client or Agency, the Recipient shall secure its Representative’s express written agreement that it will not make any business or other use of, and will in perpetuity hold in confidence, all Confidential Information acquired or learned by such Representative and shall not use or disclose such information except as permitted in this Agreement. Prohibited uses and disclosures by such Representative include, but are not limited to, uses for or disclosures to a competitor of the Producer and uses for or disclosures to any other client or prospective client of such Representative, regardless of whether the Confidential Information is aggregated with other information or its not identified with the Producer.
Producer Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Owner (unless an independent third party is required by the FTC/DOJ) for purposes permitted under this Agreement and disclosed, on an aggregate basis, to other Agency Affiliates provided: (i) the Owner and each Agency Affiliate Recipient agrees to be bound by this Agreement; (ii) Producer Confidential Information to be disclosed is at least three months old; (iii) Producer Confidential Information is aggregated with similar types of confidential information of at least 4 other commercial producers with whom the Agency or Agency Affiliate have contracted to produce commercials and who have consented in writing to have their confidential information aggregated and disclosed in accordance with this procedure provided however that no aggregated producer confidential information represents more than 25% on a weighted basis of any statistic and further provided that all information is sufficiently aggregated such that it would not allow a Recipient to identify the Confidential Information of the Producer or of any other producer whose confidential information is aggregated.
The obligations of confidentiality in this Agreement do not extend to any item of Confidential Information which (i) is publicly known at the time of its disclosure, (ii) is lawfully received by a Recipient from a third party not known to the Recipient to be under a similar confidential agreement to this Agreement or under obligation of confidentiality to the Discloser, (iii) is published or otherwise made known to the public by the Discloser of Confidential Information, (iv) was generated independently by the receiving Recipient without reliance on Confidential Information (as proven by supporting documentation evidencing such independent generation) or (v) was received either prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement or was received for the first time only after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
3. Maintenance of Confidentiality. Recipient agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable measures. Recipient shall reproduce Discloser's proprietary rights notices on any copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original. Recipient shall immediately notify Discloser upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information.
If the Recipient receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of a valid subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental body, Recipient agrees to (i) immediately notify the Discloser of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that the Discloser may seek an appropriate protective order or other reliable written assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to Confidential Information, and (ii) only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed. At all times, the Discloser shall retain sole ownership of its Confidential Information.
4. Return of Materials. At the request of the Discloser, Recipient will promptly return to the Discloser or at Discloser’s instructions destroy any written or electronic Confidential Information and all physical media on which Confidential Information was received from the other Recipient, including any copies thereof, with a letter confirming that the Confidential Information has not been reproduced or copied or that all copies have been returned and that none of the Confidential Information was disclosed to anyone except in accordance with this Agreement. The Recipient and its Representatives shall not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of such written or electronic material, except as may be needed to comply with applicable law and, provided that Recipient may retain one copy of Confidential Information in its confidential files for use only in the event a dispute arises between the Parties hereunder and only in connection with that dispute.
5. No Warranty. All confidential information is provided ""as is"" and Disclosers make no warranties of any kind, express, implied or otherwise, regarding the accuracy, utility, completeness or performance of any Confidential Information.
6. No License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to the Recipient in any copyrights or other intellectual property of the Discloser, nor shall this Agreement grant any Party any proprietary rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other Party.
7. Term. Recipient's obligations under this Agreement with respect to disclosures of Confidential Information made hereunder shall expire five (5) years from the date this Agreement is executed by the Parties.
8. Remedies. Each Recipient acknowledges that a violation of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the Discloser for which no adequate remedy at law exists and each Recipient therefore agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available, both Parties will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement without a requirement that Discloser prove irreparable harm or provide the posting of a bond.
9. Miscellaneous. The terms of this Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing signed by the Parties expressly so modifying or waiving such terms. No failure or delay by the Discloser in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. The unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of ____________________ without giving effect to any conflicts or choice of laws provisions that would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither Party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other Party except as set forth herein. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, with each an original and both of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and the Parties agree that they will be bound by electronic signatures. The Parties expressly agree and acknowledge that any disputes relating to this Agreement will be exclusively adjudicated by federal and state courts located in_______________________.
Each person who signs this Agreement represents that he/she has the authority and is empowered to sign and deliver this Agreement on behalf of the Recipient that he/she represents. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date first set forth above.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT between _ , a corporation having offices at ( Company ), and AMPHENOL Tuchel Industrial GmbH, (“Amphenol”), is effective as
WHEREAS, for the purpose stated in Section 2 below, Company and Amphenol (collectively referred to as the “Parties” and individually referred to as a “Party”) have determined to establish terms governing the use and protection of Confidential Information (as defined in Section 1 below) that one Party (“Owner”) may disclose to the other Party (“the Recipient”).
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:
1. “Confidential Information” means information that relates to the purpose stated in Section 2 below that has been designated as proprietary by the disclosing party with an appropriate conspicuous stamp or legend on the document exchanged or, although not related to such purpose, is nevertheless disclosed, and that should reasonably have been understood by the Recipient, because of appropriate and conspicuous legends or other markings, to be proprietary and confidential to the Owner, an Affiliate of the Owner or to a third party. The term “Affiliate” means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling controlled by, or under common control with a Party. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form (including magnetic media) or by oral, visual or other means. In addition, information and data disclosed orally shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement provided; (a) the disclosing party clearly identifies the orally disclosed data as proprietary at the time of disclosure, and (b) such orally disclosed data is subsequently reduced to writing, marked with an appropriate stamp or legend and provided in writing as Confidential Information pursuant to Article 2 within ten (10) days of such oral disclosures.
2. Confidential Information disclosed hereunder is intended to be used for the purpose of discussing the following general business opportunities: (the “Purpose”).
3. The Recipient shall protect such Confidential Information from disclosure to others, using the same degree of care used to protect its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance, but in any case using no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information received hereunder to (i) its Affiliates, to its employees and agents, and its Affiliates’ employees and agents, who have a need to know the Confidential Information, and who agree to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure. Confidential Information shall be used solely for the Purpose and shall not otherwise be disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the Owner.
4. The restrictions of this Agreement on use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information, which is:
(a) in the public domain as of the date of this Agreement or which later comes into the domain from a source other than the Recipient;
(b) in the Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time of Owner’s communication thereof to the Recipient;
(c) developed by the Recipient independently of and without reference to any of the Owner’s Confidential Information or other information that the Owner disclosed in confidence to any third party and there is tangible evidence to support such independent development;
(d) rightfully obtained by the Recipient from third parties authorized to make such disclosure without restriction; or
(e) approved for release by prior written authorization of the Owner.
5. In the event the Recipient is required by law, regulation or court order to disclose any of the Owner’s Confidential Information, the Recipient will promptly notify the Owner in writing prior to making any such disclosure in order to facilitate seeking a protective order by the Owner or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority. The Recipient agrees to cooperate with the Owner in seeking such order or other remedy. The Recipient further agrees that if the Owner is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information, which it is legally required, and it will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.
6. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement (including without limitation, information in computer software or held in electronic storage media) shall be and remain the property of the Owner. All such Confidential Information in tangible form shall be returned to the Owner promptly upon written request or the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and shall not thereafter be retained in any form by the Recipient, its Affiliates, or any employees or independent contractors of the Recipient or its Affiliates. The Recipient shall also certify to the Owner the timely destruction of all copies of Confidential Information and all notes and memoranda, in whatever form maintained, incorporating any Confidential Information.
The Parties’ representatives primarily responsible for coordinating disclosure and receipt of Confidential Information and further responsible for destruction and/or return of Confidential Information, upon termination of this Agreement are:

Any notice required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be given in writing to the individuals whose names are set forth above either via hand delivery or by confirmed facsimile transmission or by Federal Express or comparable overnight carrier.
7. No licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement. Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information which it does not wish to disclose or to enter into any other agreement or transaction or to purchase from or provide to the other Party any service or product.
8. The Owner represents that it has the authority to disclose to the Recipient any Confidential Information, which it elects to disclose hereunder. The Owner shall not, however, have any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in, or any decisions made by the Recipient in reliance on, any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.
9. Each party agrees to protect Confidential Information received from the other by exercising, at a minimum, the same level of care it uses to protect its own confidential information and agrees that it will (a) use such Confidential Information only for the purposes of this Agreement; (b) only make such Confidential Information available to its employees having a “need to know”; (c) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third person, except that Confidential Information may be disclosed to the demand of the Government (d) not copy or reproduce Confidential Information in whole or in part, except as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, provided that, if they do copy or reproduce Confidential Information in whole or in part, the reproduction shall carry a proprietary notice or legend similar to that which appears on the original; (e) not manufacture, sell, use, or have made devices embodying or utilizing Confidential Information, except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.
10. Except as may be required by law or to enforce the terms hereof, neither Party shall disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement, or the substance of any discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement.
11. The Parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is unique and valuable, and that disclosure in breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Owner for which monetary damages alone may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, the Parties agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality, the Owner shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or anticipated breach without the necessity of posting a bond. Any such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages.
12. Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except to an Affiliate or successor in interest, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
13. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
14. This Agreement: (a) is the complete agreement of the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior such agreements with respect to further disclosures concerning such subject matter; (b) may not be amended or in any manner modified except by a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both Parties; and (c) shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany without regard to its choice of law provisions.
15. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the Parties as expressed herein.
16. In addition to all remedies available in law and equity, a party who breaches or attempts to breach this Agreement shall be liable to the other party for all legal fees and costs incurred in the successful enforcement of this Agreement or the successful establishment of breach of this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative.

CI means Discloser’s non-public written information, in any form, and all copies, summaries and extracts which is identified in writing as confidential at the time of disclosure, and any information disclosed in non-tangible form that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and summarized in a writing labelled as “confidential” delivered to Recipient within 15 days after disclosure. CI does not include information that (A) is or becomes generally publicly available at the time of disclosure or subsequently through no fault of Recipient, (B) was known to Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, before its disclosure by Discloser, (C) becomes known to Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, from a source other than Discloser, or (D) is independently developed by Recipient without use of CI.
2. Confidentiality Obligations. Recipient will not reproduce, use, disseminate, or disclose CI to any person or entity, except to its employees and authorized representatives (i.e., temporary employees, consultants, and contractors) who need to know the CI to further the Purpose and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as this NDA before having access to the CI. Recipient is responsible for any breach of this NDA by any of its representatives. Recipient will not modify, reverse engineer, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the CI without Discloser’s prior written consent. Recipient will treat all CI with at least the same degree of care as it treats its own information of similar sensitivity, but never with less than reasonable care. Recipient will stop use of and return or destroy all tangible CI promptly upon request, together with any copies, except as otherwise required by law. Recipient may disclose CI (A) as approved in a writing signed by Discloser or (B) as necessary to respond to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, as required by law, or as necessary to establish the rights of either party, provided that Recipient promptly notifies Discloser upon receipt of the disclosure order and requests confidential treatment of any affected CI.
3. No Other Rights. All Discloser CI remains the property of Discloser. Unless expressly set forth in this NDA, Recipient does not receive any license or intellectual property rights to Discloser’s CI. Each party agrees that Recipient (A) may independently develop and acquire software, hardware, and other technology for its own products, services, and processes, and that having access to Discloser’s CI does not prohibit Recipient from freely developing or acquiring similar products without obligation to Discloser; and (B) is free to use the residuals of CI for any purpose, where “residuals” means that CI disclosed in non-tangible form that may be retained in the memories of representatives of Recipient.
4. Termination. Either party may terminate this NDA upon 10 days’ written notice. However, all CI provided under this NDA will remain subject to the terms of this NDA.
5. General. All CI is provided “AS IS” and all warranties, express, implied, or otherwise are disclaimed. Any attempt to transfer all or part of a party’s rights or obligations under this NDA without the prior written consent of the other party will be null and void. This NDA may only be modified by mutual written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties. This NDA contains the complete agreement between the parties as to the subject matter, and replaces and supersedes any other communications, or agreements, whether oral or written concerning the subject matter. Regardless of conflict of laws principles, this NDA is governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws in force in the State of California. The parties will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations in their use and disclosure of CI. This NDA may be executed in counterparts and may be signed electronically or with handwritten signatures. The English language version of this NDA will be the version used if any dispute arises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this NDA through their authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.

"MUTUAL CONFIDENTIAL & NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (Domestic)
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into this _____________ day of _______________________, 20___, between Champion Aerospace LLC, a Delaware corporation (“Champion”), and _____________________________________________________________________, a _____________________ corporation (“Company”). When Champion or Company receives Confidential Information (as defined herein) from the other party, it is a “receiving party” hereunder, and when Champion or Company discloses Confidential Information to the other party, it is a “disclosing party” hereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means confidential and proprietary information (regardless of whether such Confidential Information is in written, oral, visual or electronic form) (a) that consists of Trade Secrets (as hereinafter defined), discoveries, technical, engineering, financial, pricing and/or other business data and documentation, sales information, inventions, know-how, manufacturing techniques and specifications, process technologies, business plans, all disclosed by the disclosing party in furtherance of the purpose set forth in Section 2; (b) regarding the current and/or prospective business of the disclosing party; or (c) that is marked as confidential, proprietary or privileged by the disclosing party. “Trade Secrets” means any business or technical information (including but not limited to a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process) that derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable through independent development or through reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and that is the subject of efforts reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy thereof. The existence of a Trade Secret will not be negated merely because the information comprising the Trade Secret has also been developed and used by or owned independently by more than one person, or has been licensed to any other persons.
2. Use of Confidential Information. The receiving party is entitled to use the Confidential Information of the disclosing party solely for the purpose of quoting and manufacturing products for Champion. . Confidential Information received from the disclosing party as a result of this Agreement shall not be used directly or indirectly to compete with the disclosing party or to in any manner obtain a competitive advantage over the disclosing party. No public announcement or disclosure of the purpose set forth in this Agreement is to be made by either party unless such announcement has been approved by both parties.
3. Duties with respect to Confidential Information. The receiving party shall exercise the same degree of care and protection with respect to the Confidential Information of the disclosing party that it exercises with respect to the protection of its own confidential information of a similar nature but not less than a reasonable degree of care and shall prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information to anyone except to those of its employees that have a need to know such information solely in connection with the permitted use as set forth in Section 2 and who shall be required to observe the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. The receiving party shall not disclose, disseminate, discuss or communicate any part or all of the Confidential Information to any third party, person or entity. Confidential Information shall be used by the receiving party only for the purpose set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement and for no other purpose whatsoever. The receiving party will report immediately to the disclosing party any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.
[Company] will promptly disclose to Champion any Confidential Information developed, discovered or invented by Company in connection with the design, manufacture and supply of products to Champion. Furthermore, at the request of Champion, Company will promptly deliver to Champion all Confidential Information and all documents and materials (whether in written, graphic or machine readable form and all copies thereof) that were made or compiled by Company during the course of Company’s relationship with Champion. Company acknowledges that all such Confidential Information, and any improvements or derivations of any intellectual property used in the course of such relationship, is and shall continue to be the exclusive proprietary property of Champion, whether or not prepared in whole or in part by Company and whether or not disclosed to or entrusted to the custody of Company. Confidential Information created by Company will be considered a work for hire in which the ownership of all right, title and interest therein and thereto vests in Champion. To the extent Confidential Information created by Company is not considered a work for hire, Company will assign, and upon creation thereof does hereby assign, to Champion all right, title and interest in and to such Confidential Information, including any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret rights therein.
Company is or may become a supplier of products to Champion. Any processes, tooling and or equipment owned by Champion and used by Company are to be used exclusively by Company in the production of products for or on behalf of Champion. Company acknowledges that the useful economic life of any such product is at least 30 years. Company will not at any time, directly or indirectly, manufacture, sell, distribute, repair or overhaul any products or components thereof using any Confidential Information and during the term of this Agreement and for a period of 30 years thereafter, will not, directly or indirectly, manufacture, sell, distribute, repair or overhaul any products or components the same or identical to the products or components manufactured by Company for or on behalf of Champion (or any other product or components thereof that is sold in competition to any such products or components manufactured by Company for or on behalf of Champion ) to or for any third party without the prior written approval of Champion.
4. Exceptions to Confidentiality. The obligation of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement shall not apply to any information that: (a) is, at the time of disclosure to the receiving party, generally available to the public or thereafter becomes generally available to the public through no act, omission or fault of the receiving party; (b) is required to be disclosed by the receiving party by final order of a court of competent jurisdiction or law, regulation or rule of a self-regulatory body; provided, however, that prior to such disclosure by the receiving party, the receiving party shall provide written notice of such order or requirement to the disclosing party and allow the disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to secure confidential treatment of any information by such court or appropriate government agency, if applicable, and the receiving party shall cooperate with the disclosing party in such effort; (c) is known by the receiving party at the time of receipt from the disclosing party as evidenced by the receiving party’s documentation and not subject to an existing agreement of confidentiality; (d) was independently developed by the receiving party as evidenced by its records without use of the Confidential Information; or (e) is lawfully received without restriction from a third party who is not bound by any obligation of confidentiality.
5. Absence of License or Other Agreement. All Confidential Information shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the disclosing party. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the disclosing party to release or disclose any particular information to the receiving party. THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS” BY THE DISCLOSING PARTY AND THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED IN REGARD TO, AND DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR, THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR UTILITY OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR FOR THE CONSEQUENCES ARISING OUT OF THE USE THEREOF BY THE RECEIVING PARTY.
6. Breach. The receiving party acknowledges and agrees that the disclosing party’s remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that in the event of any actual or threatened breach by the receiving party of any of its obligations imposed by this Agreement, the disclosing party shall have the right to a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent or minimize such breach. The receiving party hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, the requirement that the disclosing party post bond prior to entry of an injunction and also waives in such injunction proceeding the defense that disclosing party has an adequate remedy at law.
7. Term; Return of Confidential Information.
7.1 Unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the parties or terminated by Champion in the event of breach by Company of any obligation set forth herein, the term of this Agreement shall continue until the
completion of the purpose set forth in Section 2. All Confidential Information shall remain subject to the obligations to maintain the confidentiality thereof indefinitely following the date of termination of this Agreement.

8. Governing Law.

Company understands and agrees that the information disclosed, made available, or provided herein is private, confidential, proprietary, and may also be controlled technical data or technology under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), or subject to other laws or regulations. Company agrees and covenants that it will not release, show, make available, disclose or deliver in any form or fashion all or any part of this information to any person who is not a U.S. Citizen, a lawful permanent resident of the United States (i.e., valid “Green Card” holder – a Visa is irrelevant for this purpose), or who has received Political Asylum in the United States without first having determined whether it is lawful to do so under U.S. laws including the EAR, ITAR , and OFAC. Further, Company will not release, show, make available, disclose or deliver in any form or fashion all or any part of this information to any non-U.S. Person without having first obtained the necessary license or approval that may be required from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Department of State, Department of Treasury, or other agency, department, or office. Company agrees that if a license or other approval is necessary it will promptly advise Champion in writing of its determination and confirm that it has not released any controlled technical data or technology and that it is seeking a license or other approval.

4.1 For purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Affiliate"" shall mean any person which either directly or indirectly controls, is directly or indirectly controlled by, or is under common control with a Party and, for purposes of this definition, a person shall be deemed to ""control"" an entity if it owns or has the ability to vote, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting securities or equivalent interest of that entity and a reference to an Affiliate shall include a reference to such Affiliate's employees, officers, directors, representatives and advisers.
4.2 The Receiving Party acknowledges that the unauthorised use or disclosure of any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party may give rise to substantial damage to the Disclosing Party.

4.5 Should the Receiving Party or any of its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers or Affiliates be obliged by any law, or a valid order of any court of competent jurisdiction or government authority acting with the powers granted to it in law, to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party, the Receiving Party shall, prior to making any such disclosure –

This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made by and between BOMI International, Inc. (“BOMI”), and you, the test taker (“Attendee”). In consideration for your right to take the CBT Test, Attendee agrees to the following:
1. “Confidential Information” shall mean all information, whether communicated in oral, written, electronic or other form, furnished by BOMI or prepared by Attendee during the Testing Period, including, but not limited to, answers and notes made by Attendee during the Testing Period, any test questions and answers, any accompanying Test materials and like information, and any and all other Test information of, or provided by, BOMI.

Without BOMI’s prior written consent, which may be given or withheld by BOMI in its sole and absolute discretion, Attendee will not at any time, whether during or after the Testing Period, (a) disclose any Confidential Information to any third party nor give any third party access thereto, nor (b) use any Confidential Information except as required in taking the Test. At all times during the testing period, Attendee agrees to abide by the Code of Professional Ethics and Conduct, a copy of which can be found online at www.bomi.org.
3.

4. Attendee agrees that money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by him and that in addition to all other remedies which may be available, BOMI will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without bond, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. All remedies available to BOMI for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.
5. In the event of any litigation between the Parties in connection with this Agreement, including the seeking of injunctive relief, if BOMI is the successful party, Attendee shall pay to BOMI therein all costs and expenses, including but not limited to actual attorneys’ fees incurred therein by BOMI, which costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees shall be included as a part of any judgment rendered in such action in addition to any other relief to which BOMI may be entitled. Should BOMI not be a successful party, the Parties will each bear their own attorneys’ fees and expenses.
6. Attendee acknowledges that all Test documents, materials, drawings, and other physical media of expression incorporating or containing any Confidential Information that BOMI furnishes to Attendee, or that Attendee prepares during the Testing Period, are BOMI’s property and will be promptly surrendered to BOMI upon the completion of the Testing Period. After the completion of the Testing Period, Attendee will make no further use of any of the Confidential Information. The foregoing will apply regardless of whether Attendee completes the Test.
7. Attendee understands that BOMI makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information disclosed, and Attendee agrees that neither BOMI nor any of its officers, directors, Attendees, agents, members or attorneys will have any liability to Attendee arising from Attendee’s use of the Confidential Information.
8. To the fullest extent permitted by law, all of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement will survive indefinitely. Attendee also understands that the obligation not to use or disclose Confidential Information shall survive the completion of Testing Period, for so long as the information remains Confidential Information. Attendee further understands that this Agreement extends to, and shall be binding upon, his heirs, successors and assigns.
9. This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements, written or oral, relating to the above subject matter, and may be modified only by a written instrument duly executed by the parties hereto. If any part of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or writing given pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, said part shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of said provision or the remaining provisions of said agreement.

2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the disclosing party, the receiving party agrees to retain the “Confidential Information” in confidence for a period of three (3) years from the date of receipt of the “Confidential Information” or until such time as the information no longer qualifies as “Confidential Information” under Paragraph 3. During this period the receiving party shall not disclose the received “Confidential Information” to any third party, and shall not use the received “Confidential Information” for any purpose other than the aforesaid purposes.

5. At the instruction of disclosing party, the receiving party agrees to either return or dispose of all information received under this agreement, discontinue any use of the “Confidential Information”, and provide written confirmation thereof.
6. No license, express or implied, in the information disclosed is granted to either party other than to use the information in the manner and to the extent authorized by the Agreement.

Between ........................................ ........................................ ........................................
(Also referred to hereinafter as the DISCLOSEE)
and Fronius International GmbH Froniusstraße 1 4643 Pettenbach
(Also referred to hereinafter as the DISCLOSER)
1. Preamble
Whereas Fronius is involved in developing battery charging systems, welding systems, alternators and related technologies and their accessories;
And whereas Fronius protects its intellectual property rights consistently via patents, other protected rights, confidentiality etc.
And whereas Fronius as the DISCLOSER will, in the course of the business dealings established with the DISCLOSEE, provide confidential information (as defined in section 2 ""Subject matter of non-disclosure agreement"" and referred to hereinafter as 'confidential information);
This contract does not imply any commercial obligation between the parties of any kind (purchasing and selling products, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.). Any commercial relations must be agreed separately.
2. Subject matter of non-disclosure agreement
 For the purposes of this non-disclosure agreement, the term 'confidential information' means information which is designated as 'confidential' or – where communicated orally – is designated as confidential or referred to similarly when communicated. Oral communications must be confirmed subsequently in writing.
The term 'confidential information' includes, but is not limited to, all documents, drawings, data, subjects, information, records, knowhow, protected rights, inventions, ideas, concepts, knowledge, technology, design, specifications, including dimensions, tolerances, materials and connections, blueprints, diagrams, software, improvements, production procedures, production processes, formulae, all documents and information concerning the company, in particular administrative and commercial facts and details concerning customers, products, suppliers and other business partners and any and all documents and information insofar as it relates to the collaboration proposed which is disclosed during the term of the contract and is accessible only to a limited circle of persons or where the DISCLOSER intends that it should only be available to a limited circle of persons, however that information may be disclosed, e.g. in writing, orally, by telephone, encoded, presented in graphic form, etc. and whatever the media and recording process used, e.g. optically, electronically or magnetically.
 The DISCLOSEE for the purposes of this agreement is the DISCLOSEE as defined above.
3. The DISCLOSEE agrees to keep any and all written, electronic and oral information and models conveyed or made available to it directly or indirectly in the course of the collaboration strictly in confidence and not to disclose it or make it available to any third party without the DISCLOSER's consent in writing.
4. The DISCLOSEE also agrees not to use the confidential information other than for the purpose as provided herein and not to use that information commercially in any way without the DISCLOSER's consent in writing.
5. The DISCLOSEE may not make confidential information available within its enterprise or organisation other than to staff who necessarily require it to perform their duties. Such persons must demonstrably be bound beforehand to keep the information confidential to the same strict extent as agreed herein, including after their contractual relationships are terminated insofar as the law allows. The DISCLOSEE will be liable for any and all losses the DISCLOSER suffers.
6. No licence, user or similar rights to any patent, patent application or knowhow may be deduced from this agreement, either directly or indirectly.
7. As with the confidential information, no results obtained from that information may be disclosed to any third parties or made available otherwise without the DISCLOSER's consent in writing. This also applies without limitations to any possible termination of the business relationship between both parties.
8. Any and all confidential information, including any and all protected and other rights created and/or produced in connection with the confidential information provided, no matter when or by whom, are the property of Fronius. The DISCLOSEE cannot deduce any rights from knowing the information and knowhow the DISCLOSER provides in respect of applying for protected rights against the DISCLOSER, particularly in terms of prior use.
9. The supplier (supplier = contractor) assures that any and all necessary rights for the production and distribution of the furnished and delivered materials and products are available and holds Fronius harmless from all and any claims by third parties resulting from an infringement of industrial and /or intellectual property rights/patents.
10. Any and all documents containing confidential information, copies of such documents and extracts the DISCLOSEE makes from such documents and models the DISCLOSER provides must be returned or demonstrably destroyed and their destruction be confirmed in writing should the DISCLOSER so require.
11. Documents which contain confidential information must not be reproduced or extracts made from them without the DISCLOSER's prior consent in writing. Models sent must not be analysed.
12. These obligations will not apply, or will cease to apply, to using information where the DISCLOSEE can show that that information
/ Passed into the public domain without breaching these obligations;
/ Was already in the DISCLOSEE's possession before the DISCLOSER disclosed it to it.
Information will be deemed to be confidential information for the purposes of this non-disclosure agreement even if the confidential information comes under one or more of these exceptions only in part, provided the confidential information itself does not come under one or more of these exceptions in its entirety.
13. This agreement is binding on and against the parties' successors, wholly or in part.
14. This agreement enters into force when signed by all contracting parties, and applies for a term of … years.
The agreement is engrossed in duplicate.
 Any amendments or additions to this agreement must be in writing.
15. This agreement is governed by Austrian law, to the exclusion of the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods and the IPRG [law on international private law]. Jurisdiction is agreed to be at Wels
If any provision of this agreement is prohibited by law or judged by a court to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, the provision shall, to the extent required, be severed from this agreement and rendered ineffective as far as possible without modifying the remaining provisions of this agreement, and shall not in any way affect any other circumstances of or the validity or enforcement of this agreement.

need to establish terms governing the use and protection of certain confidential information that one Party (“Disclosing Party”) may disclose to the other Party (“Receiving Party”).
RECITAL
Disclosing Party desires to provide Receiving Party with certain of its proprietary and confidential information for the limited purpose of evaluating the possibility of engaging in a mutually beneficial transaction or relationship. In consideration thereof, and as a condition to disclosure of such information, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Subject to the limitations set forth herein, “Confidential Information” means any and all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of Disclosing Party (whether oral, written, electronic or otherwise), including but not limited to marketing and sales data, customer lists, customer requirements, price lists, product and service lists, market studies, financial statements, business plans, the names and backgrounds of key personnel, research and development, service methods, processes, improvements, devices, know-how, inventions, discoveries, concepts, ideas, designs, methods and information, and all related notes, analyses, compilations, studies, specifications, designs, plans, enhancements, data of Disclosing Party and any notes or other materials prepared by Receiving Party or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, affiliates, attorneys and other advisors or representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) that contain or are generated from such information.
2. Upon receipt of any Confidential Information, Receiving Party shall:
(a) only disclose such Confidential Information to those of its Representatives with a need to have access to and knowledge of the Confidential Information for the limited purpose expressly stated herein and not disclose to any other person except with the prior written approval of Disclosing Party;
(b) advise any of its Representatives who receive the Confidential Information of the existence and terms of this Agreement and of the obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure herein; cause its Representatives to comply with this Agreement as if they were parties hereto; and be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives;
(c) use and require its Representatives to use at least the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information as they use to protect their own proprietary information, which degree of care shall not be less than reasonable care; and
(d) use, and require its Representatives to use, the Confidential Information only for the purpose expressly stated herein; provided that nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit or prevent either Party from continuing to operate its business in the ordinary course, including conducting business with any person who happens also to be a customer or vendor of the other Party.
3. Neither Party hereto shall be obligated to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information that:
(a) prior to any disclosure by Disclosing Party was known by Receiving Party, free of any known obligation to keep it confidential;
(b) is or becomes publicly available by other than unauthorized disclosure by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives;
(c) can verifiably be shown to have been developed by Receiving Party or its Representatives independently of any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party; or
(d) is disclosed by a third party, which disclosure does not violate any obligation of confidentiality.
4. Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party pursuant to a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency; provided that Receiving Party only discloses that portion of the Confidential Information that is specifically required by the order, and further provided that Receiving Party provides Disclosing Party with: (a) prior written notice of such order, and (b) reasonable opportunity to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order or similar relief. Receiving Party agrees to cooperate with Disclosing Party in seeking any such protective order or similar relief.
5. Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure or receipt of Confidential Information shall constitute or imply any promise, intention or commitment by either Party to enter into a business transaction with the other Party. Each Party expressly reserves the right, without giving reasons therefor, to terminate discussions with the other Party, to reject any and all proposals, and to negotiate with any person, with respect to a possible transaction or series of transactions.
6. The disclosure of any Confidential Information by Disclosing Party under the terms of this Agreement does not constitute a representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee or inducement by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information.
7. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party unless such Confidential Information is sold by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives any rights by license or otherwise in any Confidential Information, or under any trademark, patent, patent application, design work, copyright, trade secret or any other property right now owned or hereafter owned or controlled by Disclosing Party.
8. At any time upon written demand by Disclosing Party, Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately return (or, at the option of Disclosing Party, destroy) all tangible or electronic Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives under this Agreement, along with all copies, extracts and reproductions of such information and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, specifications, designs, plans, enhancements, data, prototypes, derivative works and all other works prepared by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that are derived from or based on any of the Confidential Information. Receiving Party further agrees to promptly provide Disclosing Party with written certification of the satisfaction of the terms of this paragraph by Receiving Party and each of its Representatives that had possession or control of any Confidential Information. Provided, however, that Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information, subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement, in accordance with their respective internal record retention policies for legal, compliance or regulatory purposes or to establish the rights of Receiving Party and its Representatives under this Agreement.
9. Receiving Party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause it Representative not to, remove, overprint or deface any notice of confidentiality, copyright, trademark, logo, legend or other notices of ownership or confidentiality from any original or copies of the Confidential Information it obtains from Disclosing Party, or authorize any third party to do any of the foregoing.
10. Each Party hereto agrees, and shall cause its Representatives, not to announce or disclose to any third person its participation in discussions with the other party concerning the matters contained in this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may issue a statement that contains Confidential Information if, in the opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to do so by applicable laws and if it advises Disclosing Party, at least forty-eight hours in advance, of such pending disclosure and consults with Disclosing Party as to the contents of the statement.
11. Receiving Party acknowledges that any disclosure or misappropriation of any of the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement may cause Disclosing Party irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to ascertain and, therefore, agrees that Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies and relief that would be available at law or in equity without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond. In the event of any action for breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party or its Representatives, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses incurred in such action.
13. Each party, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, agrees that in the event a party brings any action, suit or proceedings under, or seeks enforcement of any provision pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation any action for a temporary or permanent injunction (a) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the party against whom the action or enforcement is sought , (b) to irrevocably waive any objection to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient or inappropriate forum, and (c) to irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury in any such proceeding.
14. All obligations of Receiving Party with respect to any Confidential Information received from Disclosing Party under the terms of this Agreement shall survive and continue for five (5) years after the date of the last disclosure of Confidential Information by Disclosing Party.
15. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic, substantive laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be waived, amended or modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which such waiver, amendment or modification is sought to be enforced. The term “person” as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any individual, group or entity. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement is not assignable and is binding on any successors of Receiving Party. If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason adjudged to be void, invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement shall continue and remain in full force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in counterpart by facsimile, PDF or electronic signature, which shall be deemed to be an original for evidentiary purposes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.

No waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any subsequent or different breach, and no forbearance by a party to seek a remedy for noncompliance or breach by another party shall be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy with respect to such noncompliance or breach.

G. APPLICABLE LAW: The Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision of this Confidentiality Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement.
I. ATTORNEYS’ FEES: In the event that any party hereto brings a judicial action or proceeding for a declaration of the rights of the parties under this Confidentiality Agreement, for injunctive relief, for an alleged breach or default, or for any other action related to the prosecution or defense of any claim, dispute or controversy between the parties arising out of this Confidentiality Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not suit is filed or prosecuted to final judgment, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other court costs incurred and any other damages or relief awarded.

2. Use of Confidential Information; Confidentiality.
(a) Each Receiving Party shall keep all Confidential Information it receives or obtains from a Disclosing Party confidential and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose such Confidential Information, in whole or in part, and shall not use such Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than in connection with evaluating the Transaction. The exposure of the Receiving Party to the Confidential Information or its disclosure shall not be construed in any way to grant to the Receiving Party any right or license with respect to the Information other than the right to use such Confidential Information strictly in accordance with this Agreement. Moreover, each Receiving Party shall have the right to disclose that it is evaluating the Transaction and transmit Confidential Information to its Representatives only if and to the extent that such Representatives need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction and are informed by such Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and agree (in writing) to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any actions by its Affiliates and/or Representatives which are not in accordance with the agreements herein regarding the conduct of its Affiliates and/or Representatives. Visitors shall not take photographs or otherwise record the activities at the other party’s facilities.
(b) Promptly following the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, as directed by the Disclosing Party, (i) destroy (and confirm such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party) or (ii) return all Information it receives or obtains from a Disclosing Party and all copies thereof, as well as all other materials containing Confidential Information in the Receiving Party’s possession (including, without limitation, notes), without retaining any copies or extracts thereof.
(c) Should it be necessary for a Receiving Party, or anyone to whom it transmits Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement, to disclose any of the Confidential Information it received from a Disclosing Party in order to comply with applicable law or legal process (including, without limitation, the disclosure requirements of any securities exchange), the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement(s) so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In any event, the Receiving Party or such Person to whom it transmits Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in the reasonable opinion of its legal counsel, it is legally required to disclose and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information.
(d) Each Party agrees to submit to the other Party all advertising, sales, and promotional materials, press releases and other publicity materials relating to the Transaction wherein the name and/or mark of the other Party is mentioned or containing language from which the connection of said names or marks may be inferred or implied. The Parties further agree not to publish or use such advertising, sales and promotional materials, press releases, or other publicity materials before receiving the prior written approval from the other Party. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Without the consent of the other Party, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives will disclose to any other Person any information regarding its participation in discussions regarding, and evaluation of, the Transaction, including that Information has been made available or the status of the discussions and evaluations, except as required by law and then only with prior written notice as soon as practicable to the other Party.
3. Indemnification. In the event any Representative of a Party is permitted at any time to visit any of the business or project sites of another Party or any of its Affiliates, such visiting Party shall indemnify and save such other Party harmless from and against any and all claims and liabilities, including actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses for loss, injury to or death of any such person, and any loss, damage to or destruction of any property, incurred by such other Party or any of its Affiliates resulting directly or indirectly from the negligence or misconduct of any of such Representatives during any such visit. In no event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for consequential damages.
4. Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party would be irreparably injured by a breach of this Agreement by a Receiving Party or its Affiliates or Representatives and that each Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by any of the other Parties. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
5. No Grant of Rights. No license, intellectual property right or other ownership or use right is conveyed solely by this Agreement, except the limited right to use Confidential Information described in Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement.
6. Contact with Employees, Customers, Suppliers, etc. Except in the ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives will initiate or maintain contact with any Person employed by Chief Enterprises or its Affiliates or with any customer or supplier of Chief Enterprises or its Affiliates, regarding the business, prospects, operations or finances of Chief Enterprises or its Affiliates except with the prior written consent of Chief Enterprises.
7. Non-Solicitation. The Company acknowledges that Chief Enterprises has invested and will continue to invest significant time and money to develop valuable, continuing relationships with existing and prospective clients and customers of Chief Enterprises.

The Company agrees that, for the term of this Agreement and for two (2) years following its termination, Company will not directly or indirectly, solicit or assist others in soliciting, or attempt to solicit or assist others in attempting to solicit, (i) any existing customers, clients, suppliers, business partners, and/or vendors of Chief Enterprises with or about whom the Company obtained Confidential Information, or (ii) any prospective customers, clients, suppliers, business partners, and/or vendors of Chief Enterprises with or about whom the Company obtained Confidential Information and with whom Chief Enterprises took significant steps to do business with during the term of this Agreement, for the purpose or effect of inducing such existing or prospective customers, clients, suppliers, business partners, and/or vendors to cease doing business or reduce their business with Chief Enterprises or to purchase, lease, or utilize products or services that are competitive with, similar to, or that may be used as substitutes for any products or services offered by Chief Enterprises.
8. Non-Waiver. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois applicable to agreements made and to be performed within such State and all disputes shall be venued exclusively in state or federal courts situated in Chicago, Illinois.
10. Securities. Chief Enterprises and the Company each acknowledge that it is aware, and will advise its Representatives, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.
11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, no one of which needs to be executed by both Parties, and this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties with the same force and effect as if each Party had signed the same document, and each such signed counterpart shall constitute an original of this Agreement.
12. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement is invalid as applied to any fact or circumstance, it shall be modified by the minimum extent necessary to render it valid, and its invalidity shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the same provision as applied to any other fact or circumstance.

"CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE & APPROPRIATE USE AGREEMENT
FAU has a legal responsibility to safeguard the confidentiality and security of our patients’ protected health information (“PHI”) as well as operational, proprietary, and student and employee information (collectively “FAU Confidential Information”). This information may include, but is not limited to, patient health records, as well as information regarding human resources, payroll, fiscal matters, research, and strategic planning, and may exist in any form, including electronic, video, spoken, or written. This Agreement applies to all members of the workforce, including but not limited to, employees, volunteers, students, faculty, physicians, and third parties, whether temporary or permanent, paid or not paid, visiting, or designated as affiliates or associates, who are employed by, contracted with, or under the direct control of FAU. This Agreement also applies to all users who are granted access to FAU-issued computing and technology resources (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, printers, etc.), application systems or access to the FAU network, whether the user is affiliated with FAU or not, and whether access to or use of the information systems occurs locally or from remote locations. I hereby agree as follows:
 I will maintain patient privacy and protect and safeguard the confidentiality and security of PHI and FAU Confidential Information in accordance with Florida and federal laws and FAU policies and procedures.
 I understand that access to health information created, received, or maintained by FAU or its affiliates is limited to those who have a valid business, medical, or professional need to know the information. I understand that FAU has implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of PHI, and I agree not to bypass or disable these safeguards.
 I will not disclose any PHI to any individual or third party, except as specifically authorized by FAU policies and procedures, and upon receiving a written authorization from the patient (unless otherwise required by applicable law), and then only on a need-to-know basis.
 I will not use any PHI in an inappropriate, unethical, detrimental or unauthorized manner.
 I will not discuss any information regarding FAU or patients in an area where unauthorized individuals may overhear such information, including waiting rooms, hallways, elevators and other public areas. I understand that it is strictly prohibited to discuss any FAU Confidential Information or PHI in public areas even if a patient’s name is not used.
 I understand that I will be given a unique User ID and password to access electronic health, operational, proprietary, student or employee or other confidential information. I understand that my User ID and password are confidential, may only be used by me, that I am responsible for safekeeping my password, that I am also responsible for any activity initiated by my User ID and password, and that in certain circumstances my User ID and password may be equivalent to my legal signature. If I suspect that my User ID or password has been compromised, I should immediately contact FAU’s Office of Information Technology (“FAU OIT”).
 I have no expectation of privacy when using FAU information systems. FAU shall have the right to record, audit, log, and/or monitor access to or use of its information systems that is attributed to my User ID. I agree to practice good workstation security measures on any computing device that uses or accesses a FAU information system. Good security measures include, but are not limited to, maintaining physical security of electronic devices, never leaving a device unattended while in use, and adequately shielding the screen from unauthorized viewing by others.
 I understand that only encrypted and password protected devices may be used to transport PHI or other Restricted Data (defined below).
 I understand that smartphones and other mobile devices used to access FAU information systems must be configured to encrypt any Restricted or Sensitive Data (defined below), including photographs and videos, in persistent storage. I understand that I may access and/or use FAU Confidential Information, Restricted Data and Sensitive Data only as necessary to perform my job-related duties and that I may disclose (i.e., share) FAU Confidential Information, Restricted Data, and/or Sensitive Data only to authorized individuals with a need to know that information in connection with the performance of their job functions or professional duties.
1. Restricted Data: Data in any format collected, developed, maintained, or managed by or on behalf of FAU, or within the scope of FAU’s activities, that are subject to specific protections under federal or state law or regulations or under applicable contracts (e.g., medical records, Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, Florida driver licenses, and export controlled data).
2. Sensitive Data: Data whose loss or unauthorized disclosure would impair the functions of FAU, cause significant financial or reputational loss, or lead to likely legal liability (e.g., financial information, salary information, policies, research work in progress, and copyrighted or trademarked material).
 I understand that upon termination of my employment/affiliation/association with FAU, I will immediately return or destroy, as appropriate, any FAU Confidential Information, Restricted Data and Sensitive Data in my possession. I understand that my confidentiality obligations under this Agreement will continue after the termination of this Agreement and after termination of my employment, affiliation or association with FAU.
 I agree to immediately report any known or suspected violation of the confidentiality or security of PHI of patients of FAU to FAU’s Chief Compliance Officer.
 I understand that violations of this Agreement may result in revocation of my user privileges and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination of my employment, affiliation or association with FAU, and that FAU may seek any civil or criminal recourse and/or equitable relief.

In consideration of the disclosure by BDO to the undersigned of any portion of the Information, the sufficiency of which consideration is hereby acknowledged; the undersigned hereby undertakes and agrees as follows:
1. To maintain the Information in the strictest of confidence and to control the dissemination of the Information, including any documents or copies (paper, electronic or otherwise) thereof contained in the Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”);
2.

4. To advise the Representatives of the confidential nature of the Information, and to provide to those Representatives to which or to whom the Information is provided a copy of the NDA, and if such Representative is not otherwise bound by restrictions on disclosure and use similar to the obligations hereunder, to have such Representatives agree to be bound by this NDA;
5. The undersigned shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions of this NDA by any of the Representatives to whom the undersigned discloses Information;
6. The undersigned and its Representatives shall under no circumstances contact directly or indirectly any of the residents, partners or former partners or directors of Baldwin: (i) to ask any questions regarding the possible acquisition of all or part of the Assets,

10.

(a) “Confidential Information” shall include all information pertaining to the Assignors and their respective affiliates, employees, salespersons, independent contractors, agents, officers, directors, customers, suppliers, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, dealers, predecessors, successors and assigns disclosed by the Disclosing Party (or by a third party at the direction of the Disclosing Party) to the Receiving Party, regardless of the form or manner of disclosure (including, but not limited to, information learned by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party’s employees, agents, officers, directors, professional advisors or other representatives or through inspection of the Assigned Assets or the books and records of the Assignors), and including, but not limited to: (i) information that relates to the Assignors’ trade secrets, products, services, product specifications, data, inventions, ideas, techniques, know-how, past, current and planned research and development, current and planned methods and processes, client lists, current and anticipated client, service provider and consultant requirements, price lists, market studies, business strategy and plans, business opportunities, computer hardware, software and programs (including object codes and source codes), computer database technologies and systems, and distribution, marketing, financial, merchandising, customer, sales and/or salary information; (ii) all information concerning the Assignors’ business and affairs, operations, finances, assets, liabilities, forecasts, historical financial statements, financial projections and budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending, budgets, strategic plans, marketing and advertising plans, publications, agreements, the names and backgrounds of clients and consultants and other service providers, key personnel, personnel training, and techniques and materials; (iii) third party confidential information in the custody or care of the Disclosing Party to the extent the same is subject to a duty of confidentiality to such third party; (iv) all offering documents and materials (including offering memoranda, supplements thereto and similar documents); (v) all notes, analyses, compilations, statistics, studies, summaries, interpretations, and other material prepared by or for the Receiving Party which contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect, in whole or in part, any of the foregoing; and (vi) the existence and terms and conditions of this Agreement and the existence and content of the discussions between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party regarding a Possible Transaction. Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party need not be identified as “confidential” to be deemed “Confidential Information” pursuant to this Agreement.
(b) “Confidential Materials” shall mean all materials containing Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all writings and recordings, including the originals and all non-identical copies, whether different from the original by reason of any notation made on such copies or otherwise (including, without limitation, e-mails and attachments, correspondence, memoranda, notes, diaries, minutes, statistics, statements, tags, labels, invoices, brochures, periodicals, telegrams, receipts, returns, summaries, pamphlets, books, inter-office and intra-office communications, offers, notations of any sort of conversations, working papers, applications, permits, file wrappers, indices, telephone calls, meetings or printouts, teletypes, telefaxes, invoices, work sheets, and all drafts, alterations, modifications, changes and amendments of any of the foregoing), and graphic or aural representations of any kind (including, without limitation, photographs, charts, microfiche, microfilm, video tape, recordings, motion pictures, plans, drawings, and surveys), and all materials within the full scope of FED.R.CIV.P. 34 including, but not limited to, all electronic, mechanical, magnetic, or optical records or representations of any kind (including, without limitation, computer files and programs, tapes, cassettes, discs, recordings), metadata, and information stored on a computer, laptop, hand-held computer device, disk, CD, DVD, and any mechanical recording or production of any oral material.
2. Trade Secrets. All trade secrets of the Assignors also shall be entitled to all of the protections and benefits of the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the “Trade Secrets Act”) and any other applicable laws. If any information that the Disclosing Party deems to be a trade secret of the Assignors is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade secret, then such information nevertheless shall be considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement. In the case of trade secrets, the Receiving Party waives any requirement that the Disclosing Party submit proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a bond or other security. Additionally, the Receiving Party acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement (including Section 17 below) shall place a time limitation on the period of protection of such trade secret, it being agreed that the trade secrets of the Assignors shall enjoy perpetual protection against unauthorized disclosure or use, subject only to the provisions of the Trade Secrets Act and other applicable laws.
3. Limitations. The term “Confidential Information” shall not include such portions of the Confidential Information that: (i) are already published or available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors (collectively, the “Representatives”); (ii) become available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Disclosing Party or one of the Disclosing Party’s employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors) that is not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party by a legal, contractual, or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party or the Assignors; (iii) can be shown by written documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reliance upon any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials of the Disclosing Party; and/or (iv) was demonstrably within the actual possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives prior to it being furnished by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant to this Agreement.
4. Property of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials are and shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. By disclosing information to the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right or interest in the patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret information, or intellectual property rights of the Assignors. The Disclosing Party reserves the right to limit the Receiving Party’s access to the premises, facilities, equipment, customers, vendors, data and other materials, information and personnel of the Assignors (including, without limitation, as provided in Section 9 below).
5. Non-Disclosure. The Receiving Party: (i) shall treat the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials as confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) shall not use or disclose to any person the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials for any purpose other than in connection with the consideration of a Possible Transaction, subject in all cases to the provisions of this Agreement; (iii) shall not copy or reproduce any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; (iv) shall reveal the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials only to its Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials in connection with a Possible Transaction, and who (A) are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials, and (B) before receiving the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, agree to maintain their confidentiality in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (v) except as provided in Section 7 below, shall not, without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, disclose (A) to any other person, other than its Representatives, the fact that the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials have been made available to the Receiving Party, (B) that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction, or (C) any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect thereto; (vi) shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials from disclosure to any person or entity other than its Representatives, including taking reasonable security precautions at least as great as the precautions the Receiving Party takes to protect its own confidential information; and (vii) segregate all Confidential Information and Confidential Materials from the confidential information or confidential materials of others. At the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall require its Representatives to sign a copy of this Agreement. Regardless of whether the Receiving Party’s Representatives sign a copy of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives, and shall fully cooperate with the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials and prevent the unauthorized use of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials.
6. Return of Confidential Information and Confidential Materials. The Receiving Party shall keep a written record of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials furnished to it and the location of such Confidential Information and Confidential Materials. At any time, at the Disclosing Party’s request, all copies of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials shall be returned to the Disclosing Party within five (5) business days of such request; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall be permitted to retain a list that contains general descriptions of the documents it has returned to the Disclosing Party to facilitate the resolution of any controversies after the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials have been returned. To the extent that the Receiving Party utilizes any portion of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to prepare its own analyses, compilations, studies, data, notes, interpretations or other documents (the “Notes”), at any time, at the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party shall destroy the Notes and promptly thereafter provide the Disclosing Party with written certification of their destruction. The Receiving Party shall also, within ten (10) days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, certify in writing that it has satisfied its obligations under this Section 6 or explain why the Receiving Party has been unable to do so. All Confidential Information and Confidential Materials shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement even after their return or destruction or the termination of this Agreement.
7. Legal Compulsion to Disclose Confidential Information or Confidential Materials. In the event that the Receiving Party is issued any subpoena or other process requesting any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, the Receiving Party agrees that it will immediately furnish a copy of such subpoena or other process, via overnight delivery, to counsel to the Assignee, Edward J. Peterson, Esq. and Matthew B. Hale, Esq. of Stichter, Riedel, Blain & Postler, P.A., 110 East Madison Street, Suite 200, Tampa, Florida 33602, and to the Disclosing Party at the address set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, then the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Receiving Party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials which the Receiving Party determines in its reasonable discretion is required to be disclosed and the Receiving Party shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance from the person to whom it furnishes the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information or Confidential Materials. The Receiving Party also agrees that it will, to the extent authorized by law, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party in opposing the production of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials; provided, however, in the event the Receiving Party incurs any cost or expense in providing such cooperation, the Disclosing Party shall promptly reimburse the Receiving Party for any such cost or expense upon the Receiving Party’s tendering of a receipt therefor. If an opinion of independent counsel is required prior to compliance with a subpoena or court order, the Disclosing Party agrees to reimburse the Receiving Party for the associated costs.
8. Attorney-Client Privilege. The Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived, its attorney-client privilege with respect to any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials (including, without limitation, Confidential Information or Confidential Materials pertaining to pending or threatened litigation) which may be disclosed hereunder by the Disclosing Party and with respect to which the Disclosing Party has asserted, or is entitled to assert, its attorney-client privilege. The Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to require that such Confidential Information or Confidential Materials be disclosed only to certain specified Representatives and to the Receiving Party’s legal counsel and that no further disclosure thereof be made.
9. HIPAA Compliance. The Receiving Party agrees that it will not have access to any patient care information or records of the Assignors that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), absent the execution of a separate agreement that addresses HIPAA requirements. Until the consummation of the Possible Transaction, the Receiving Party agrees that it shall not contact or otherwise communicate with any patients (past, present, or future) of the Assignors without obtaining the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party and allowing one or more Representatives of the Disclosing Party to be present at the time of any meetings with any such patients. To the extent confidential patient or other information protected by HIPAA is inadvertently disclosed to the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party shall hold such information in strictest confidence, shall notify the Disclosing Party of its receipt of such information, and shall promptly thereafter return such information to the Disclosing Party and destroy any and all copies thereof. This Section 9 shall survive the closing of the Possible Transaction and/or the termination of this Agreement.
10. Remedies. The Receiving Party shall indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party harmless from any damages, losses, costs, or liabilities arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and other litigation expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials and the damage that would result to the Disclosing Party if information contained therein were disclosed to any third party, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives. Therefore, in addition to all other remedies, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, and the Receiving Party and its Representatives waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.
11. No Representations or Warranties. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors (i) has made or will make any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or the relevance of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to the Receiving Party’s determination whether to enter into a Possible Transaction or the terms on which the Receiving Party might be prepared to do so or (ii) shall have any liability whatsoever to the Receiving Party or its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of or reliance upon the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, other than as may be set forth in a definitive agreement (a “Definitive Agreement”) between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction. Only those representations and warranties contained in a Definitive Agreement between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction shall have any legal effect. The Disclosing Party shall not be liable to the Receiving Party for amounts representing loss of profits, loss of business or indirect, consequential or punitive damages of the Receiving Party in connection with the provision or use of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials.
12. Transaction Process. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party shall have the right to reject or accept any potential proposal or offer with respect to a Possible Transaction, for any reason whatsoever, in its sole discretion. Furthermore, neither the discussions between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction nor the disclosure of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials hereunder shall be interpreted or construed to limit or restrict the right of the Disclosing Party to furnish or disclose the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to others for any purpose it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the pursuit or consideration of a possible transaction with such other person or entity. The Parties further agree that unless and until a Definitive Agreement between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction (including, without limitation, any obligation to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract) by reason of this Agreement, the transmission of any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, any written or oral expression with respect to a Possible Transaction or for any other reason. Each Party reserves the right at any time to terminate its consideration of a Possible Transaction.
13. Governing Law and Venue. The internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, shall govern the validity and interpretation of this Agreement, and the performance by the Parties of their respective duties and obligations hereunder. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Florida and of the United States of America located in the State of Florida, County of Hillsborough, for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties shall not commence any action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement except in such courts. The Parties agree that they may be served with process and receive notices at their respective addresses set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue in any of the aforementioned courts and shall not plead or claim in any such court that an action, suit or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
14. Notice and Service of Process. All service of process, notices, consents, requests, claims, demands, instructions or other communications to be given hereunder by the Parties shall be in writing. All such service of process, notices, consents, requests, claims, demands, instructions or other communications may be given personally, by registered or certified mail (with proof of receipt, postage and expenses prepaid, return receipt requested), express package service, facsimile transmission, or electronic mail transmission. All such notices shall be deemed to be received as follows: (i) if delivered personally, when received, (ii) if mailed, three (3) days after being mailed, (iii) if sent by express package service, when signed for, (iv) if sent by facsimile transmission, when the fax has transmitted over the telephone lines, as evidenced by a fax confirmation report generated by the transmitting machine (provided that a copy of such notice is also sent via U.S. mail, postage prepaid), and (v) if sent by electronic mail transmission, two (2) days after being sent. All notices shall be sent to the Parties at their respective addresses set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that all (a) requests for Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, (b) communications regarding the Possible Transaction, (c) requests for facility tours or meetings, and (d) discussions or questions regarding procedures, shall be submitted or directed to Soneet Kapila of the Disclosing Party, unless otherwise directed in writing by Soneet Kapila.
15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions between the Parties covering the subject matter hereof, supersedes all prior agreements and understandings concerning such subject matter, whether oral or written, and cannot be amended except by a written agreement executed by an authorized representative of each Party.
16. Waiver of Breach. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless the same is waived in writing by the Party against whom such waiver is to be enforced. No valid waiver of any provision of this Agreement at any time shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement at such time or will be deemed a valid waiver of such provision at any other time. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
17. Term. Unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of a Possible Transaction pursuant to a Definitive Agreement, and (ii) two (2) years from the date that the Parties terminate their discussions and consideration of a Possible Transaction; provided, however, that all Confidential Information and Confidential Materials shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement after the termination of this Agreement.
18. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any provision of this Agreement to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, or inconsistent with any present or future law, ruling, rule, policy or regulation of any court or governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, then the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and such provision shall be deemed to be rescinded or modified in accordance with such law, ruling, rule, policy or regulation, and the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those to which it shall be held inconsistent, shall not be affected thereby.
19. Binding Nature; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives. Neither this Agreement, nor any right hereunder, may be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party.
20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the Parties. A facsimile signature shall be considered the same as an original signature for purposes of execution of this Agreement.
21. Publicity. No publicity, release or announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be made by either Party without advance written approval thereof by the other Party. The Receiving Party will not use or permit the use of the Disclosing Party’s or any Assignor’s name, logos, trademarks or other identifying data, or otherwise discuss or make reference to the Disclosing Party or the Assignors, in any notices to third parties, any promotional or marketing material or in any press release or other public announcement or advertisement, however characterized, without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent.
22. Drafting. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted for or against either Party on the basis that such Party was the draftsman of such provision, both Parties having participated equally in the drafting hereof, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND NON-DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
The undersigned Prospective Investor (“Investor”) is executing this Agreement as of _____________________,20__, in connection with the distribution of certain confidential information relative to the possible retail/commercial development site (the ""Development"") offered by (“Owner”). Any and all information, including but not limited to, location, financial information, title reports, surveys, and other agreements, documents, materials and oral and/or written information with respect to the Property, whether delivered or made available concurrently with this Agreement or to be delivered in the future (collectively, the Confidential Information"") shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement
The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the Investor’s limited use and benefit in determining whether the Investor desires to express any further interest in the acquisition and development of the Property.
With respect to the Confidential Information, the Investor agrees as follows:
1. NON-DISCLOSURE. Investor shall keep the Confidential Information permanently and strictly confidential, and not to disclose or divulge any Confidential Information to, or reproduce any Confidential Information for the benefit of any person or entity other than the Investor’s employees, representatives, consultants, and agents who are actively and directly participating in the analysis of the Development, and in such cases only to the extent reasonably required for such analysis. The Investor also agrees to inform all such employees, representatives, consultants, and agents of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, to provide them with a copy of this Agreement, to obtain their agreement to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to take such other action as may be reasonably necessary to cause such employees to comply with these confidentiality provisions. Investor is strictly prohibited from publishing any news release, public announcement, denial or confirmation with respect to the Development, this Agreement or any information about the Property. The Investor agrees to be fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement caused by such employees, representatives, consultants, and agents.
2. LIMITATION ON USE. Investor’s use of the Confidential Information shall solely be for the purpose of evaluating the Property and the Development. If the Investor elects not to proceed with the Development, or if the undersigned is informed that the Property is no longer available for purchase or if the Investor is otherwise requested by the Owner to return the Confidential Information, the Investor will promptly return all Confidential Information (and all reproductions or destroy electronic copies thereof if any);
3. INDEMNIFICATION. Investor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Owner and its affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, partners, agents and employees) from and against all claims, actions, causes of action, damages, losses and liabilities (including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) arising out of or based upon any breach of this Agreement. The Investor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Owner harmless against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses arising in any way related to claims(s) by another broker, finder or similar agent for commissions, fees or other compensation for bringing about a sale of the Property to the Investor if such claims(s) is based from dealings with the Investor.
The undersigned further understands, warrants and agrees that:
1. Nothing contained in the Confidential Information should be construed as a representation by any person as to the current condition or future performance of the Property. The Confidential Information speaks as of the date thereof and should not be deemed to imply that there has been no change in the condition of the Property since that date. Financial projections, if any, are provided for general reference purposes only, as they are based in part on assumptions about the general economy, competition, and other factors beyond the control of the Owner. Therefore, due to inherent limitations involved in predicting future events, actual cash flows, income and expense will differ from projections and/or from financial conditions in previous years, and the difference may be material.
2. Owner has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information those materials which Owner believes to be reliable and relevant for the purpose of the Investor's evaluation of the Property and the Development, but the Investor acknowledges that neither Owner nor any of its agents, representatives, or employees makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information.
3. The Confidential Information is being delivered or made available to the Investor with the understanding that the Investor will independently investigate all matters that the undersigned deems appropriate in evaluating the Property and the proposed Development.
4. The extent and irreparable nature of the damages that may result from a breach of this Agreement may make Owner’s legal remedies for such a breach inadequate. Therefore, in the event of such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Owner shall be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief without proof of actual damages, in addition, and not in substitution for, any other remedy Owner may have.
5. All written Confidential Information and any copies thereof in the Investor's possession or the possession of the Investor's employees or agents, including, without limitation, that portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Investor, shall be returned to Owner promptly upon its request. All unwritten Confidential Information shall be held by the Investor and kept strictly confidential by the Investor and its employees, representatives, and agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in perpetuity.
6. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan; and in the event of any suit or action or appeal therefrom to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its costs and attorney's fees.
7. Each person executing this Agreement in a representative capacity represents and warrants that he and/or she is authorized to sign this Agreement on behalf of the entity set forth below.
8. The Investor acknowledges that the Confidential Information would not have been furnished to the undersigned in the absence of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not constitute Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement: (i) information that has become generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by or through the Investor or its employees, representatives, and agents; (ii) information that was available to the Investor on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the undersigned by the Owner; and (iii) information that becomes available to the Investor from a source not subject, to the best knowledge of the Investor after due inquiry, to any prohibition against disclosing the information to the undersigned. Undersigned acknowledges that the location of the Property is Confidential Information.
Brokers may not obtain the Confidential Information without first obtaining the signature of a qualified Prospective Investor.

A. EACH PARTY ENVISAGES PROVIDING CERTAIN INFORMATION TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE PURPOSE(S): A POTENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP;
B. EACH PARTY HAS AGREED THAT DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND EXCLUDED INFORMATION
1.1. “Confidential Information” shall mean information that is revealed by or obtained through a party (whether in writing, orally or by any other means) (a “Disclosing Party”) to the other (a “Receiving Party”) including, without limitation, (i) all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information including, for example, pricing, strategies, studies, assessments, plans, compilations, program devices, formulae, designs, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes and any information directly relating to the integrity or security of computer networks or systems; (ii) information traditionally recognized as trade secrets; (iii) all data and information about a party’s customers (current, former or prospective) and Employees and Advisors (as such terms are defined below); (iv) the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Disclosure Purpose); and (v) all copies of any of the foregoing or any analyses, studies or reports that contain, are based on, or reflect any of the foregoing.
1.2. The confidentiality obligations set forth under this Agreement do not extend to Excluded Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Excluded Information” means information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate (i) was known to the Receiving Party without restriction prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (ii) became publicly available through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) was developed at any time by the Receiving Party independent of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
2. RESTRICTED USE
2.1. The Receiving Party must keep Confidential Information under its control, establish and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard Confidential Information and shall treat the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as it protects its own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature but, in any event, with no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall only use the Confidential Information for the Disclosure Purpose.
2.2. The Receiving Party shall not disclose, duplicate, transmit or otherwise disseminate in any manner the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, except to the Receiving Party’s officers, directors and employees (collectively “Employees”), and the Receiving Party’s agents, contractors and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, legal advisors, auditors and accountants) retained by the Receiving Party (collectively “Advisors”). All such persons receiving Confidential Information shall have a need to know and shall be bound by professional duty or in writing (in advance) to confidentiality and non-use obligations at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be liable to the Disclosing Party in the event that any of its Employees or Advisors breach such obligations, and upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party shall promptly provide documentary proof of its compliance with the immediately preceding sentence.
2.3. Each party may only make as many copies of Confidential Information as are reasonably necessary for its permitted use under the terms hereof, and each such copy will be marked with the same proprietary notices, indicia and legends that appear on the originals.
2.4. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information to comply with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or with a mandatory requirement of a governing regulatory body, such party shall, to the extent permitted by law and as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances, inform the Disclosing Party to allow it an adequate opportunity to object to the disclosure order or to take such other actions as are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the information. The Receiving Party shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party in such party’s reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure by means of a protective order or a request for confidential treatment.
3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CURRENT OR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
3.1. As between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, Confidential Information and all applicable intellectual property rights embodied in the Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving Party or any of its Employees or Advisors, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, except to the extent as expressly stated in this Agreement.
3.2. The Disclosing Party understands that Receiving Party may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties that may be similar to Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that Receiving Party will not develop products, or have products developed for it that compete with the products, systems or services contemplated by Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
4. WARRANTIES NOR REPRESENTATIONS
4.1. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RELATION TO ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS OR COMPLETENESS OF ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
5. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE
5.1. Each party agrees to advise the other party promptly in writing of any unauthorized misappropriation, disclosure or use by any person of the other party’s Confidential Information which may come to its attention and to take all steps reasonably requested by the disclosing party to limit, stop or otherwise remedy such misappropriation, disclosure or use.
5.2. The unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information may cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party which could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Each party therefore authorizes the other party to seek any temporary or permanent injunctive relief necessary to prevent such disclosure or use, or threat of disclosure or use.
6. TERM ; TERMINATION ; EFFECTS OF TERMINATION
6.1. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date stated above. This Agreement shall continue in force for three (3) years unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 6.2.
6.2. Each party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason, by serving at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the other party.
6.3. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement the Receiving Party's right to use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information ceases and the Receiving Party must, upon the Disclosing Party’s request and at the Receiving Party’s expense, promptly return to the Disclosing Party or permanently destroy all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its power, possession or control. Having acknowledged that it, particularly within a networked environment, the return and/or destruction of electronically stored information may be impossible, extremely or otherwise unduly difficult or costly, the immediately preceding sentence is not intended to, and does not obligate the Receiving Party to make extra-ordinary efforts to destroy electronically stored copies of the Confidential Information, provided that, in relation to any such copy that is not destroyed the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use shall continue as per the provisions of this Agreement.
6.4. Notwithstanding Section 6.3, the Receiving Party may retain a reasonable number of copies of the Confidential Information (and any materials embedding the same) (“Retained Copies”) for the sole purpose of (i) satisfying any legal or regulatory requirements regarding record and data retention that the Receiving Party is obligated to comply with; (ii) enforcing this Agreement; and/or (iii) archiving consistent with good business practices and the Receiving Party’s internal policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use as set forth in this Agreement shall continue in respect of such Retained Copies as per the provisions of this Agreement.
6.5. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use hereunder shall continue in force during the term of this Agreement and shall survive for three (3) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement or, in the case of trade secrets, until such time as the Confidential Information does not qualify as a trade secret.
7. GENERAL PROVISIONS
7.1. Notice. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be served in writing to Imperva or Company (as applicable) to the attention of “Legal Department” at the notice address indicated above and will be deemed given: (i) upon receipt if by personal delivery; (ii) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (iii) two (2) days after it is sent if by overnight delivery by a major commercial delivery service. Either party may, by like notice, specify or change an address to which notices and communications shall thereafter be sent.
7.2. Entire Agreement. Save as expressly stated herein, this Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous agreements, understandings or commitments between the parties whether oral or written with respect to the subject matter hereof.
7.3. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
7.4. Relationship of the Parties. The parties hereto are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between Imperva and Company. Neither party shall have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. This Agreement does not express or imply any commitment on behalf of either party to disclose any particular information to the other party or to purchase or sell goods or services from or to the other party, or to conclude any similar business transaction with the other party.
7.5. Waiver. A provision of or a right created under this Agreement may not be (i) waived except in a writing executed by the party granting the waiver; or (ii) varied except in a writing duly executed by the parties. No waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach or right in the same or in any other provision hereof.
7.6. Assignment. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations (in whole or in part) under this Agreement to any person or entity without the other party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that, either party may, without such consent, assign and transfer this Agreement to a successor to substantially all of its business or assets. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
7.7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Queensland (and intended in conjunction with the laws of New South Wales and Victoria; when not in conflict with the laws of Queensland) and the parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Queensland (with consideration of the jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales).

"NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT
NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT
This AGREEMENT (this ""Agreement""), is made as of October 7, 2002 (the ""Effective Date""), by and between MERITAGE CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (""Meritage""), MTH-HOMES NEVADA, INC., an Arizona corporation (the ""Company""), ZENITH NATIONAL INSURANCE CORP., a Delaware corporation (""Zenith""), and PERMA-BILT, a Nevada corporation (""Seller"" and, together with Zenith, ""Selling Parties"").
R E C I T A L S
Seller is engaged in homebuilding and home sales operations.
Zenith indirectly owns all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Seller.
The Business will be acquired by the Company pursuant to a Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2002 (the ""Master Agreement""). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Master Agreement.
Selling Parties have intimate knowledge of the business practices of the Business, which, if exploited by Selling Parties in contravention of this Agreement, would seriously, adversely, and irreparably affect the ability of the Company to continue the businesses previously conducted by Seller.
To induce the Company to enter into the Master Agreement, Selling Parties have agreed to execute this Agreement.
In consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and covenants of the parties set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Selling Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
1. Noncompetition.
(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the * anniversary thereof (the ""Restriction Period""), neither Selling Parties nor any subsidiary, sister entity, or parent will, directly or indirectly, either as a partner or owner or in any other capacity:
(i) engage in the homebuilding or home sales business within 100 miles of the Las Vegas metropolitan area (a ""Competing Business"");
(ii) recruit, hire or discuss employment for a Competing Business with any person who is, or within the six month period preceding the date of such activity was, an employee of the Company or Meritage (other than as a result of a general solicitation for employment); or
(iii) solicit any customer or supplier of the Company for a Competing Business or otherwise attempt to induce any such customer or supplier to discontinue its relationship with the Company.
(b) Selling Parties represent to the Company and Meritage, and Selling Parties acknowledge, that:
(i) they are willing and able to engage in a business that is not a Competing Business;
(ii) enforcement of the restrictions set forth in this Section 1 would not be unduly burdensome to Selling Parties;
(iii) the period of time provided for in this Section 1 and the territorial restrictions and other provisions and restrictions set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company and its successors and assigns in the use and employment of the goodwill of the business conducted by Perma-Bilt Homes prior to the Effective Date; and
(iv) damages cannot compensate the Company in the event of a violation of this Section 1, and that if such violation should occur, injunctive relief shall be essential for the protection of the Company and its successors and assigns.
Accordingly, Selling Parties hereby covenant and agree that, in the event any of the provisions of this Section 1 shall be violated or breached, the Company shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the party or parties violating such covenants, without bond but upon due notice, in addition to such further or other relief as may be available at equity or law. Obtainment of such an injunction by the Company shall not be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of any right to assert any other remedies which the Company has at law or in equity. No waiver of any breach or violation hereof shall be implied from forbearance or failure by the Company to take action thereof. Zenith agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing this provision if it is determined that Selling Parties breached this Agreement.
(c) Selling Parties hereby agree that upon becoming a partner, member, owner or investor of another enterprise or any third-party during the period in which the terms of this Section 1 are in effect, each shall promptly disclose to such new enterprise or third-party the terms of this Section 1, and shall cause such enterprise or third-party to maintain such information in confidence. Selling Parties further agree and authorize the Company to notify others, including customers of the Company and any such future enterprise or third-party to which either Zenith or Seller may become a partner, member, owner or investor, of the terms of this Section 1 and of their obligations hereunder.
(d) Selling Parties hereby agree that the period of time in which this Section 1 is in effect shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of any breach of this Section 1(a) by Selling Parties.
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Selling Parties or their affiliates or associates, any of their directors, officers or employees, or any of their representatives from investing in stocks, bonds, or other securities of any entity that engages in a Competing Business, provided, however, that in the case of capital stock, such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market or registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and such investment does not exceed, in the case of any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, three percent of the issued and outstanding voting power at the time of such investment. In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent any officer or director of the Selling Parties or their affiliates or associates from serving as a director or trustee of any Competing Business.
2. Protection of Information. Selling Parties recognize and acknowledge that the Company's trade secrets and all other confidential and proprietary information of a business, financial or other nature, including without limitation, proprietary information of the Company, as it exists from time to time (collectively, ""Confidential Information""), are valuable and unique assets of the Company and therefore agree that, during the Restriction Period, except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, or the rules of any exchange on which any securities of Zenith are or will be listed, they will not, and will use their best efforts to ensure that their directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents and consultants do not, disclose any Confidential Information concerning the Company and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates, to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, for any reason whatsoever, unless previously authorized in writing to do so by Meritage. It is understood that Confidential Information shall not include any information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by Selling Parties or that is disclosed by Selling Parties in accordance with the terms of a prior written consent of Meritage. For the purpose of enforcing this provision, the Company may resort to any remedy available to it under the law. In the event that any Selling Party is requested pursuant to, or required by, Applicable Laws, regulation or rules of any securities exchange or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Company, the Selling Parties agree that they shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Company to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, to consult with the Selling Parties with respect to the Company taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process, or to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Section 2. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Company waives compliance with the terms of this Section 2, Selling Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to disclose only that portion of any Confidential Information which Selling Parties are advised by counsel is legally required and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information so disclosed shall be accorded confidential treatment in accordance with this Section 2.
3. Severability. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Restriction Period is unenforceable, the Restriction Period shall mean *. Additionally, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, then such provision will be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification will render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.
4. Waiver. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
5. Injunctive Relief. Selling Parties acknowledge and agree that Meritage and the Company would be irreparably harmed by any violation of Selling Parties' obligations under Sections 1 and 2 hereof and that, in addition to all other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, the Company will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or enjoin any such violation.
6. Assignment by Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Zenith, Seller, Meritage or the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon such consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the terms ""Zenith,"" ""Seller,"" ""Meritage"" and ""Company,"" respectively, as used herein shall mean such other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. For purposes of Sections 1 and 2 hereof, the term ""Company"" shall mean all joint ventures (50% or more owned by Company), subsidiaries and parent companies of Company (whether corporate, partnership or other form), including the subsidiary that operates the Business as a division of Meritage Corporation.
7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the complete agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior written, or prior or contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements between the parties that may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by Meritage and Selling Parties.
8. Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions relating to its validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Nevada.
9. Notice. All notices, consents, and other communications hereunder will be in writing and deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand, (b) sent by telecopier (with receipt confirmed), or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by Express Mail, Federal Express, or other express delivery service (with delivery confirmation), in each case to the appropriate addresses and telecopier numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and telecopier numbers as a party may designate as to itself by notice to the other):

"COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE
This Covenant Not to Compete (this ""Agreement"") is made this 3rd day of April, 1996 by and among Lumex, Inc., a New York corporation (""Seller""), Lumex Medical Products, Inc. (f/k/a MUL Acquisition Corp. I), a Delaware corporation (""Purchaser I""), MUL Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware Corporation (""Purchaser II) (Purchaser I and Purchaser II are collectively referred to herein as ""Purchasers""), and Fuqua Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""Parent"").
WITNESSETH
WHEREAS, Seller through its Lumex division (the ""Division"") and an affiliated leasing company is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, leasing and distributing a wide variety of health care products; and
WHEREAS, Purchasers, wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent, are to acquire substantially all of the assets and properties of the Division pursuant to an Asset Sale Agreement, dated as of March 13, 1996, among Seller, Purchasers and Parent (the ""Asset Sale Agreement""); capitalized terms used herein and defined in the Asset Sale Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Asset Sale Agreement when used herein unless otherwise defined herein or unless the context otherwise requires; and
WHEREAS, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Sale Agreement, Purchasers will control and conduct the Business (as hereinafter defined); and
WHEREAS, to induce Purchasers and Parent to consummate the Asset Sale Agreement and to acquire the Assets, Seller has agreed to execute this Agreement, the terms and conditions of which are a material and integral part of the consideration for the Asset Sale Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and covenants of the parties set forth in this Agreement and the Asset Sale Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS
As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context specifically requires otherwise:
1.01 ""BUSINESS"" shall mean the design, manufacture, marketing, sale, leasing and distribution of health care products of the types and performing the functions of the products designed, manufactured, marketed, sold, leased or distributed by Seller through the Division as of the date of this Agreement.
1.02 ""COMPETE"" OR ""COMPETING"" shall mean with respect to the Business: (i) the design, manufacture, marketing, sale, leasing or distribution of health care products of the types or performing the functions of the products designed, manufactured, marketed, sold, leased and distributed by Seller through the Division as of the date of this Agreement; (ii) hiring, soliciting or attempting to hire or solicit any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date either on Seller's behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity; or (iii) entering into or attempting to enter into any business substantially similar to the Business, either alone or with any individual, partnership, corporation or association; provided, however, that Competing shall not mean or include the ownership, disposition or use of Excluded Assets.
1.03 ""DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY"" as they modify the words ""Compete"" or ""Competing"" shall mean: (i) acting as an agent, representative, consultant, or independent contractor of any entity or enterprise that is Competing with the Business; (ii) participating in any such Competing entity or enterprise as an owner, partner, limited partner, joint venturer, or stockholder (except as a stockholder owning less than a five percent interest in a corporation whose shares are actively traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market); and (iii) communicating to any such Competing entity or enterprise the names or addresses or any other information concerning any past, present or identified prospective client, customer or supplier of the Division prior to Closing.
1.04 ""TERRITORY"" shall mean the United States of America and Canada.
ARTICLE II
NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE
2.01 SCOPE AND REASONABLENESS. Seller acknowledges that this Agreement (including without limitation the covenants and agreements set forth in this Article II) is being entered into as an important part of the consideration received by Purchasers and Parent in connection with the acquisition of the Assets. Seller also acknowledges that Purchasers and Parent have a reasonable present and future expectation of continuing the Business within the Territory.
2.02 CONFIDENTIALITY AND TRADE SECRETS.
(a) Seller acknowledges and agrees that as the owner of the Division it has created substantial confidential information used in and concerning the business and has been afforded an unique opportunity to acquire confidential information concerning the Business and that the misappropriation or disclosure of such confidential information would cause irreparable harm to Purchasers and Parent. Seller acknowledges that such confidential information includes, without limitation, financial information concerning the Business, the names and addresses of actual and potential customers of the Business, studies of prospective market areas for the Business, supply sources of the Business, products of the Business, technical data concerning the Business, ideas of the Business, processes of the Business, financial matters concerning the Business, and trade secrets of the Business, such information collectively being referred to as the ""Confidential Information."" For purposes of this Agreement ""trade secrets"" means any information that derives independent value from being secret. Confidential Information shall not include any information or documents that (i) are or become publicly available without breach of this Section 2.02, (ii) Seller receives from any third party who, to the best of Seller's knowledge upon reasonable inquiry, is not breaching an obligation of confidence with Purchasers or Parent (including such an obligation under an agreement assigned to Purchasers pursuant to the Asset Sale Agreement) or without an accompanying obligation of confidence, or (iii) is required to be released by law. In the event that Seller is requested in any court or governmental proceeding to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall give Purchasers and Parent prompt notice of such request, such that Purchasers or Parent may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief, and in any such proceeding Seller will disclose only so much of the Confidential Information as is required to be disclosed.
(b) Seller will keep confidential and will not for a period of three (3) years after the execution of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, divulge to anyone, use or otherwise appropriate any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose whatsoever except to authorized representatives of Purchasers or the Parent.
(c) With respect to any trade secrets included in the Confidential Information, Seller also agrees not to use or disclose any of such trade secrets at any time until such trade secrets become generally available to the public by independent discovery or development and publication through no fault of Seller. Seller acknowledges and agrees that these prohibitions against disclosure of Confidential Information are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that Purchasers or Parent may have available pursuant to the laws of any jurisdiction or at common law to prevent disclosure of trade secrets or proprietary information, and the enforcement by Purchasers or Parent of any of their rights and remedies pursuant to this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or available remedies they may possess in law or equity absent this Agreement.
2.03 NON-COMPETITION. Seller agrees that for a period of three (3) years following the execution of this Agreement, it will not, without Purchasers' prior written consent, Directly or Indirectly Compete with Purchasers in the Business within the Territory.
2.04 NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-INTERFERENCE. Seller agrees that for a period of one (1) year after the execution of this Agreement, it will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, partnership, firm or corporation hire any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date, or request or induce any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date to terminate his or her employment and accept employment with another entity.
2.05 REMEDIES. Seller acknowledges that any violation of this Article II will cause irreparable harm to Purchasers and Parent and that damages are not an adequate remedy. Seller, therefore, agrees that Purchasers and Parent shall be entitled to an injunction, without the necessity of posting any bond, enjoining, prohibiting, and restraining Seller from the continuance of any such violation, in addition to any monetary recovery that might be available to Purchasers and Parent by reason of a violation of this Agreement and any other remedies at law or in equity, including without limitation specific performance.
2.06 INDEPENDENT. The covenants set forth in the foregoing Sections of Article II are and shall be deemed and construed as separate and independent covenants. Should any part or provision of such covenants be held invalid, void, or unenforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision thereof. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any portion of Section 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 or 2.04 is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction because its duration, the Territory, and/or the Business or any definition or restriction are invalid or unreasonable in scope, such duration, Territory, and/or Business or any definition or restriction, as the case may be, shall be redefined by consideration of the reasonable concerns and needs of Purchasers such that the intent of Purchasers, the Company and Seller, in agreeing to Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 and 2.04, will not be impaired and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent of the applicable laws.
ARTICLE III
MISCELLANEOUS
3.01 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto, except that Purchasers' and Parent's rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement may be assigned and delegated to any subsidiary of Purchasers or Parent or to the acquiror of Purchasers, Parent or the Business in the event either Purchaser or Parent is merged, acquired, sells substantially all of its interest in the Business, or transfers its interest in the Business to any other entity. From and after any such assignment by Purchasers or Parent, the term ""Purchasers"" or ""Parent,"" as the case may be, shall mean such assignee, and such assignee may enforce any of the rights of Purchasers or Parent under this Agreement as if it were the original party hereto.
3.02 INTEGRATED AGREEMENT AND CONSIDERATION. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements (other than the Asset Sale Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection therewith) relating to the same subject matter. Seller hereby acknowledges that the consideration specified herein and in the Asset Sale Agreement is good and valuable consideration received by Seller for the covenants and undertakings described in this Agreement, and such covenants and undertakings are ancillary to, and an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Sale Agreement.
3.03 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will take effect as an original and all of which shall evidence one and the same agreement.
3.04 GOVERNING LAW. The terms of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
3.05 PRONOUNS. All pronouns used herein shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender as the context requires.
3.07 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and permitted assigns.

Richard A. Bearse
Senior Vice President, Planning and Development
United Dominion Industries
2300 One First Union Center
301 South College Street
Charlotte, NC 28202-6039
Dear Mr. Bearse:
You have requested information regarding lmo Industries Inc. (the ""Company"", ""us"" or ""we"") in connection with your consideration of a possible negotiated transaction with the Company (a ""Possible Transaction""). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:
CONFIDENTIALITY OF EVALUATION MATERIALS
You and your representatives (as defined herein) will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (""CSFB""), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the ""Evaluation Materials""). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.
The term ""Evaluation Materials"" includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as ""confidential"". The term ""Evaluation Materials"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you or your representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not to your knowledge prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you.
USE OF EVALUATION MATERIALS
You and your representatives will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential and will not disclose the Evaluation Materials, in any manner, in whole or in part; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, ""your representatives"") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you and shall agree to treat such information confidentially in accordance with this Agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. You will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your representatives.
In the event that you or any of your representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company (at the Company's expense) in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) you shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by you or your representatives not permitted by this Agreement.
NON-DISCLOSURE
The disclosure of your possible interest in negotiating a transaction with the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that you have entered into this Agreement, that Evaluation Materials have been made available or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof. The term ""person"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.
RETURN OF DOCUMENTS
Upon the Company's request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Materials, you and your representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
NO UNAUTHORIZED CONTACT OR SOLICITATION
During the course of your evaluation, you agree that all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to CSFB or employees or representatives of the Company specified by CSFB.
Without the Company's prior written consent, the persons who are involved in the possible transaction will not for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment any person who is now employed by the Company (or whose activities are dedicated to the Company) in an executive or management level position or otherwise considered by the Company to be a key employee.
STANDSTILL
You agree that until one year from the date of this Agreement, you will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a ""group"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. Except as provided above, you also agree during such period not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives) to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.
NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
Although the Company and CSFB have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of your investigation, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, CSFB or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, CSFB or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to you or any other person resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by you or any of your representatives, except as may be set forth in a definitive sale agreement. Only those representations or warranties that are made in a definitive agreement relating to the Company (""Sale Agreement"") when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.
You also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto. You also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and you with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Sale Agreement"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by you.
You further understand and agree that (i) the Company and CSFB shall be free to conduct the process regarding a transaction involving the Company as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a Sale Agreement without prior notice to you or to any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such sale may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person and (iii) you shall not have any claims whatsoever against the Company, CSFB or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, owners, affiliates, agents or representatives arising out of or relating to a transaction involving the Company (other than those as against the parties to a Sale Agreement with you in accordance with the terms thereof).
LEGAL REMEDY
You understand and agree that the Company would be irreparably injured and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives and that the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.
You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and you agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), and further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to your address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against you in any such court. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.
This Agreement and all of your obligations hereunder shall expire five years after the date hereof.
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.
Very truly yours,
IMO INDUSTRIES INC.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and effective as of November 19, 1998, by and between National Medical Health Card Systems, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates (""Health Card"") and John Ciufo (""Ciufo""). The parties acknowledge the following facts:
A. Health Card and Ciufo are desirous to engage in a possible relationship between the parties which may require an examination by Ciufo of Health Card and its business undertakings (the ""Project""); and
B. In order to proceed with the Project, Health Card may disclose to Ciufo certain Proprietary Information (as such term is hereinafter defined).
In consideration of the above promises and the covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties agree as follows:
1. a. ""Proprietary Information"" means information including, but not limited to clients, pricing and information which is related to the business of Health Card from which Health Card (1) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is the subject of efforts by Health Card that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy, including without limitation (i) with respect to information which has been reduced to tangible form, marking such information clearly and conspicuously with a legend identifying its confidential or proprietary nature; (ii) with respect to any oral presentation or communication, denominating such information as confidential immediately before, during or after such oral presentation or communication; or (iii) otherwise treating such information as confidential. Assuming the criteria in clauses (1) and (2) above are met, Proprietary Information includes, but is not limited to technical and nontechnical information and data related to the formulas, patterns, designs, compilations, programs, inventions, methods, techniques, drawings, processes, finances, actual or potential customers and suppliers, research, development, existing and future products, and employees of Health Card. Proprietary Information also includes information which has been disclosed to Health Card by a third party, which Health Card is obligated to treat as confidential.
b. Proprietary Information does not include any information which (1) is already known to Ciufo at the time it is disclosed to Ciufo by Health Card, provided that such information has been rightfully received by Ciufo from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of an obligation of confidentiality running directly or indirectly to Health Card; (2) is disclosed by Ciufo pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or is required to be disclosed by operation of law; provided, however, that Ciufo shall first have given written notice of such required disclosure to Health Card to allow Health Card to seek to protect the confidentiality of the information required to be disclosed; or (3) before being divulged by Ciufo (i) has become generally known to the public through no wrongful act of Ciufo (ii) has been rightfully received by Ciufo from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of an obligation of confidentiality running directly or indirectly to Health Card; (iii) has been approved for release to the general public by written authorization of Health Card; (iv) has been independently developed by Ciufo without use, directly or indirectly, of the Proprietary Information; or (v) has been furnished to a third party by Health Card without restrictions on the third party's right to disclose the information.
2. Ciufo (a) must receive and hold the Proprietary Information in trust and in strictest confidence; (b) must protect the Proprietary Information from disclosure and in no event take any action causing, or failing to take reasonable action necessary in order to prevent, any Proprietary Information disclosed to Ciufo to lose its character as Proprietary Information; and (c) must not use, duplicate, reproduce, distribute, disclose or otherwise disseminate the Proprietary Information except to perform the Project. Any and all reproductions of the Proprietary Information must prominently contain a confidentiality legend.
3. Disclosures of the Proprietary Information may be made only to employees, agents, associates or independent contractors of Ciufo (a) who are directly involved in the Project and have a specific need to know such information; and (b) whom Ciufo has obligated to hold the Proprietary Information in trust and in strictest confidence.
4. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement may be assigned only upon the prior written approval of the parties. The rights and obligations of the parties will inure to the benefit of, will be binding upon and will be enforceable by the parties and their lawful successors and representatives.
5. No modification of this Agreement or waiver of any of its terms will be effective unless set forth in a writing signed by the party against whom it is sought to be enforced.
6. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same Agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.
7. Ciufo acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this agreement, Health Card may be without an adequate remedy at law and, accordingly, shall be entitled to enforce such provision by temporary or permanent injunctive or mandatory relief obtained in an action or proceeding instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of proving damages and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which it may have at law or in equity. Ciufo hereby agrees to the jurisdiction of all federal and state courts within the state of the defending party in connection with any matter relating to this Agreement. Ciufo further agrees that service of process may be made, in addition to all other methods permitted by law, by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, sent to the address set forth below.

DATED: December ___, 1996
Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), dated December __, 1996 (the ""Merger Agreement""), among AMERICAN UNITED GLOBAL, INC., a Delaware corporation (""AUGI"") and its affiliate BTS ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation (""Mergerco""), both having their principal offices at 11130 NE 33rd Place, Suite 250, Bellevue, WA 98004; BROADCAST TOWER SITES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the ""Company""), having its principal offices at 4340 East West Highway, Suite 1000, Bethesda, Maryland 20814; and SIMANTOV MOSKONA and SERGIO LUCIANI (hereinafter referred to individually a ""Stockholder"" and collectively, the ""Stockholders""). The Merger Agreement provides for a merger of the Company with and into Mergerco, with Mergerco as the surviving corporation of such merger (the ""Merger""). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of the Company's capital stock will be converted into the right to receive cash, certain promissory notes of AUGI and shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share of AUGI.
In order to induce AUGI and Mergerco to consummate the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof, the undersigned Stockholders of the Company who beneficially own 100% shares of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock, shall receive in connection with the Merger Agreement (i) an aggregate of 507,246 shares of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of AUGI (""AUGI Common Stock""), (ii) $600,000 principal amount of three year notes of AUGI (the ""AUGI Notes""), and (iii) $780,000 in cash, hereby covenants and agrees with the Company and AUGI as follows:
1. Non-Competition. Each of the Stockholders severally agrees that for a period (the ""Restrictive Period"") which shall commence on the Effective Date of the Merger and shall expire on a date which shall be the latest to occur of: (a) such date as such Stockholder shall no longer be employed on a full-time basis with AUGI or any other subsidiary or affiliate of AUGI; or (b) three (3) years following the effectiveness of the Merger (the ""Restrictive Period""), without the prior written consent of AUGI, such Stockholder shall not invest, carry on, engage or become involved, either as an employee, agent, advisor, officer, director, stockholder, manager, partner, joint venturer, participant or consultant in any business enterprise (other than Mergerco, AUGI or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns) which derives any material revenues from the offer or sale in the United States from time to time during the Restrictive Period of services relating to all aspects of providing site acquisition, zoning, architectural and engineering consulting and design services to the wireless telecommunications industry (the ""Business""), or which engages in any other business substantially similar to and directly competitive with the Business conducted by the Company as at the date hereof. Nothing contained in this Section 1 shall be deemed to prevent a Stockholder from (a) leasing or renting real property in which the Stockholder owns a direct or indirect interest to a person or entity engaged in the Business; or (b) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or less of any class of securities of an entity that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so long as such securities ownership does not include any operational, managerial or consulting relationship with such corporation or entity.
2. Confidential Information.
(a) Each of Stockholders severally agrees that such Stockholder shall not, at any time following the effectiveness of the Merger, print, publish, divulge or communicate to any person, firm, corporation or other business organization or use for his or their own account any business contacts, customers, suppliers, technology, product designs and specifications, know-how, trade secrets, marketing techniques, promotional materials or other secret or confidential information relating to the Business or any other businesses then being engaged in by AUGI or any of its subsidiaries, or any secret or confidential information relating to the affairs, dealings and concerns of the Company, AUGI or any of the subsidiaries of AUGI (collectively, the ""Confidential Information"") which the Stockholder has received or obtained while an employee or member of the Board of Directors of AUGI or the Company (whether or not developed, devised, or otherwise created in whole or in part by the efforts of the Stockholder). The term ""Confidential Information"" does not include information which information and its relevance in the particular instance (A) is a matter of common knowledge or public record, (B) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Stockholder, (C) which information and its relevance is generally known in Business, (D) the Stockholder can demonstrate that such information and its relevance in the applicable instance, was already known to the recipient thereof other than by reason of any breach of any obligation of the Stockholder under this Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, or (E) the information is required to be disclosed by law or pursuant to court order or subpoeona.
(b) The term Confidential Information as defined in Section 2(a) hereof shall include information obtained by the Company from any third party under an agreement including restrictions on disclosure known to the Stockholder.
(c) In the event that a Stockholder is requested pursuant to subpoena or other legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such Stockholder will provide the Company with prompt notice (unless notice is prohibited by law) so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with Section 2 of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement, the Stockholder will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required.
3. Material Agreement.
(a) It is understood by and between the parties hereto that the foregoing covenants by the Stockholders are essential elements of this Agreement and that but for the agreements of the Stockholders to comply with such covenants, AUGI would not have entered into the Merger Agreement or paid the Merger Consideration to the Stockholders. AUGI and the Stockholders have independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants with specific regard to the businesses conducted by the Company.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, express or implied, contained in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or in any other ""Transaction Document"" (as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement), no future act of omission or commission by AUGI or any of its affiliates, or other actual or alleged breach by AUGI or such affiliates of any of their covenants or agreements contained in any Transaction Documents (in addition to this Agreement), shall in any way be deemed to modify, limit or terminate the covenants and agreements of the Stockholders contained in Section 1 and Section 2 hereof, all of which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.
4. Without intending to limit the remedies available to AUGI or the Company, each Stockholder further agrees that damages at law will be an insufficient remedy to AUGI if such Stockholder(s) breaches the terms of this Agreement and that AUGI or the Company may apply for and have injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the breach or threatened breach of or otherwise to specifically enforce any of the covenants contained herein, in each case without the necessity of proving damages or posting bond.
5. This Agreement shall become effective upon the effectiveness of the Merger and shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Restrictive Period only with the written consent of AUGI.
6. Any paragraph, sentence, phrase or other provision of this Agreement which is in conflict with any applicable statute, rule or other law shall be deemed, if possible, to be modified or altered to conform thereto or, if not possible, to be omitted herefrom. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not affect the force and effect of the remaining valid portion hereof.
7. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED (BOTH AS TO VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE) AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH JURISDICTION.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed by or on behalf of each party hereto on the date set forth above.

This Agreement shall apply to: (a) confidential or proprietary exchanged material and information (in written, taped or computerized form or format) that is clearly and prominently marked ""Proprietary or ""Confidential"" or that is not so marked but, by its nature, is such that it reasonably should be held in confidence, including, but not limited to, technical, developmental, marketing, editorial, sales, operating, performance, cost, know-how, computer programming techniques, and any new or planned programs and services; (b) the existence and substance of oral and written communications between the parties about the potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship; and (c) the existence of the discussions between Company and Kaplan about the potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship. (Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) above hereinafter referred to collectively as ""Confidential Information."")
2. Each party agrees to hold the other's Confidential Information in confidence and to use it solely for the purposes contemplated herein and agrees further that the Confidential Information shall not be used for any other purpose nor disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party.

disclosed to the Receiving Party; (b) publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party; (c) rightfully received from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of this Agreement; (d) independently developed by the Receiving Party; (e) approved for release by written authorization of the party disclosing the Confidential Information (the ""Disclosing Party""); (f) furnished by the Disclosing Party to a third party without written restriction on disclosure; or (g) disclosed pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law, provided, however, that, to the extent viable under the circumstances, the party subject to the disclosure requirement has notified the Disclosing Party in advance of such disclosure and the Disclosing Party has had an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and the party subject to the disclosure requirement has reasonably cooperated with such efforts; and provided further, however, that the -------- ------- -------
Receiving Party furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be so disclosed.
5. The Receiving Party shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise analyze, restructure and/or copy or in any way recreate in whole or in part any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.
6. If any party provides any of the other parties with written notification of its request for return of its Confidential Information, then the other party(ies) shall promptly return (unless destroyed pursuant to the immediately following sentence) to the notifying party all materials and information comprising the notifying party's Confidential Information, including any and all copies, facsimiles and reproductions thereof, and any other material containing or reflecting any materials or information in the Confidential Information. All other documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party's representatives based on the materials or information in the Confidential Information shall be destroyed and such destruction shall be confirmed in writing to the notifying party.
7. All right, title and interest in and to the Confidential Information and intellectual property produced based on the Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Subject only to the Receiving Party's limited use of the Confidential Information for the purpose set forth above in this Agreement, the Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, and the Receiving Party shall not violate any of the Disclosing Party's intellectual property or other rights in or to the Confidential Information.
8. The parties hereby acknowledge that disclosure of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof would cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party.

The parties further agree that neither party nor any of their respective representatives shall have any liability to the other party or any of such other party's representatives resulting from the use or contents of the Confidential Information or from any action taken or inaction occurring in reliance on the Confidential Information.
10. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from the effective date hereof.

Further, each party understands that the other party may now market or have under development products and/or services which are competitive with the products or services now offered or which may be offered in the future by its own company. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, discussions and/or communications between the parties hereto will not serve to impair the right of each party to develop, make, use, procure and/or market products or services now or in the future which may be competitive with those offered by the other party nor require either party to disclose any planning or other information to the other party, provided none of the foregoing activities violate the terms of this Agreement.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the ""Agreement"") made this 18th day of November, 2005, by and between Yale University School of Medicine, a nonprofit, educational corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Connecticut, with an office located at Yale University School of Medicine, having its principal office at 47 College Street, Suite 203, New Haven, Connecticut (hereinafter, the ""Pilot Site"") and Advanced BioPhotonics Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware , with its principal office at 125 Wilbur Place, Suite 120, Bohemia, New York (hereinafter, the ""ABP"") and the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. The parties intend to pursue a Pilot Study to test its functionality, performance and reliability to determine the applicability of this technology to plastic surgery applications, which will be carried out by Dr. Yuan Liu utilizing ABP's BioScanIR(R) system consisting of the following elements: (i) system hardware components: infrared camera, mobile cart, computer workstation, camera power supply, universal power management unit, temperature controller and black body; (ii) proprietary DIRI(R) software for control of system components, data acquisition, data processing, data archiving and reporting; and (iii) applications software packages (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the ""System"") as further defined in the Pilot Site Agreement between the parties (hereinafter referred to as the ""Pilot Study""), and in the course of which the parties may exchange Proprietary Information, as hereinafter defined. The parties further desire to protect such Proprietary Information from unauthorized disclosure and use under the terms and conditions herein.
2. For purposes of this Agreement, Proprietary Information shall mean, without limitation, computer programs, code, algorithms, names and expertise of employees and consultants, formulas, processes, inventions, schematics and other technical, business, financial, pricing and product development plans, forecasts and strategies, together with any analysis or tangible embodiments of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information created by the Receiving Party. Proprietary Information shall be designated as such in writing by the Disclosing Party by appropriate legend or stamp, or, if first disclosed in a non-written or other non-tangible form, Proprietary Information shall be identified by the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure as being disclosed in confidence and shall be reduced to tangible form and marked as confidential or proprietary and such tangible form shall be delivered to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days after the date of first disclosure. During the above stated thirty-day period such Proprietary Information shall be protected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Proprietary Information shall further include any information or data that evidence, record, derive from or reveal any Proprietary Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the components of the System are hereby deemed to be Proprietary Information and as such are protected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
3. The Receiving Party shall preserve Proprietary Information received from the Disclosing Party in confidence by exercising at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of the Receiving Party's own similar confidential information, but at least a reasonable degree of care, and shall refrain from disclosing such Propriety Information to its employees not involved in the Pilot Study, its consultants, representatives, or agents ( the ""Affiliates"") or to any third party without written authorization from the Disclosing Party. This Agreement shall be construed to bind and impose obligations upon any other divisions, subsidiaries, business units, and/or affiliated companies of the Receiving Party that receive access to the Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall ensure that all copies of Proprietary Information stored electronically on its server, tape backup or on the hard drives of computers used by its Affiliates in connection with the Pilot Study have been permanently deleted and Receiving Party shall certify such deletion in writing to the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party will ensure that all of its Affiliates sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement containing confidentiality restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement.
4. The Receiving Party shall use Proprietary Information received from the Disclosing Party solely for the purposes set forth in Paragraph 1. Any other use of the Proprietary Information is explicitly forbidden. This restriction shall survive termination of this Agreement.
5. This Agreement shall not restrict disclosure or use of Proprietary Information that is:
A. Now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of Receiving Party, generally known or available; or B. Known by the Receiving Party at the time of receiving such information as evidenced by records of the Receiving Party; or
C. Hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, as a matter of right and without restriction on disclosure, by a third party who had not received any Proprietary Information from the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party; or
D. is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing party; or
E. Independently developed by the Receiving Party by persons who did not have access to the Disclosing Party's information and without breach of this Agreement.
6. The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information to the extent required to be disclosed pursuant to final court order; provided, however, that the Receiving Party: (i) immediately notifies the Disclosing Party upon its receipt of any court order or other document that requests or demands disclosure of Proprietary Information; and (ii) assert the privileged and confidential nature of the Proprietary Information against the third party seeking disclosure; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure of the Proprietary Information. In the event that such protection against disclosure is not obtained, the receiving party will be entitled to disclose the Proprietary Information, but only to the extent necessary to legally comply with such compelled disclosure and to have such required disclosure made under a protective secrecy order.
7. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Proprietary Information, and will reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of the Proprietary Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.
8. Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the originating party. Neither this Agreement nor any exchange of Proprietary Information hereunder shall be construed as granting any right or license under any copyright, invention, or patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by either party. Each party shall use and rely upon Proprietary Information received from the other at its sole risk and expense.

13. The Receiving Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, including, without limitation, the actual or threatened disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information without the prior express written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Disclosing Party will suffer an irreparable injury, such that no remedy at law will afford the Disclosing Party with adequate protection against, or appropriate compensation for, such injury. The Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Disclosing Party may be entitled to specific performance of the Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement, as well as further relief (injunctive or otherwise) as may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction.

15. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties, superseding all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to the exchange of Proprietary Information in connection with the Pilot Study.
16. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement shall be held illegal, unenforceable, or in conflict with international law or any law of a federal, state or local government having jurisdiction over this Agreement, the validity of the remaining portions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.
17. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
 This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is entered into as of July 26, 2002 by and between Big Sky Transportation Company (""Big Sky"") and Mesaba Holdings, Inc. (""Holdings"").
 In connection with a potential transaction (the ""Transaction"") between Holdings and Big Sky, Big Sky has and will furnish to Holdings certain information (""Information"") including but not limited to financial, marketing and operational information, and such other information necessary for Holdings to evaluate the transaction. The term ""Information"" shall mean all information that Big Sky has furnished or is furnishing to Holdings, whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement, whether tangible or intangible and in whatever form or medium provided, as well as all information generated by Holdings or by its Representatives, as defined below, that contains, reflects or is derived from the furnished information.
 In consideration of Big Sky's disclosure to Holdings of the Information, Holdings agrees that it will keep the Information confidential and that the Information will not, without the prior written consent of Big Sky, be disclosed by Holdings or by its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (collectively, ""Representatives""), in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and shall not be used by Holdings or by its Representatives, other than in connection with evaluating the Transaction. Moreover, Big Sky agrees to transmit the Information only to such of its Representatives who need to know the Information for the sole purpose of assisting Holdings in evaluating the Transaction and who are informed of this Agreement.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above restrictions shall not apply to the following:
(i) Information that is publicly available at the time of disclosure (through no act of Holdings of any of its Representatives);
(ii) Information that is disclosed to Holdings by a third party that did not disclose it in violation of a duty of confidentiality;
(iii) Information that was known to Holdings before such Information was provided to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of Big Sky;
(iv) disclosures that are required to be made by Holdings or any of its Representatives under legal process by subpoena or other court order or other applicable laws or regulations (provided, however, that Holdings makes reasonable efforts to provide copies of such Information to, or informs Big Sky before disclosure), or that are requested by Big Sky.
 Without the prior written consent of Big Sky, neither Holdings nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the fact that Holdings has received any Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction, including the status thereof. Likewise, without the prior written consent of Holdings, neither Big Sky nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the fact that Holdings has received any Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction, including the status thereof.
 Big Sky and Holdings agree that, at the conclusion of their review of the Information, or within three business days of the other's request, all copies of the Information, in any form whatsoever, will be delivered by Holdings and its Representatives to Big Sky.
 Neither Big Sky nor any of its Representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Information. Holdings agrees that neither Big Sky nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to it or to any of its Representatives resulting from the provision or use of the Information.
 Each party acknowledges that it has been informed that the other party is a publicly-traded corporation and that the Information and the Transaction must be secured from any use or dissemination until such time as proper disclosure can be provided to shareholders and the securities markets in order to protect the interests of shareholders of each party and so that the rules and statutes pertaining to information about and trading in publicly held securities can be followed. During
such time as the parties are involved in discussions or negotiations concerning the Transaction and for a period of at least 60 days after conclusion thereof, neither party shall engage in any transactions whatsoever regarding the common stock of the other, whether publicly traded or privately held, registered or nonregistered, including, but not limited to, buying, selling, taking or granting options in or making or receiving offers or tender offers to buy, sell, trade, or exchange any stock of the other, without the express written consent of the other and without first fully complying with all applicable securities laws and regulations and the rules of all exchanges upon which the stock of each respective party is traded, provided however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit the right of either party to invest in mutual funds or other commercially available investment vehicles that may acquire the stock of the other party.
 Each party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement by it, the other would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, each party shall be entitled to an injunction of injunctions (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement, and that neither party nor any of its Representatives will oppose the granting of such relief.
 No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof.
 Big Sky and Holdings agree that, unless and until a definitive agreement between them with respect to the Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Holdings nor Big Sky will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression by either party or by any of their respective Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. This Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing by Holdings and Big Sky expressly so modifying or waiving such Agreement.
 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota applicable to contracts between residents of Minnesota that are to be wholly performed within such state. Big Sky and Holdings hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive the right to a jury trial in connection with any claim arising out of related to this Agreement, the Information, or the Transaction.
 In witness whereof, this Agreement has been executed as of the date first written above.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) between Universal Hospital Services, Inc. (“UHS”) and Emergent Group, Inc. (“Company”), is effective October 26, 2010.
Whereas, UHS and Company intend to engage in confidential discussions for the purpose of evaluating a potential business transaction between UHS and Company (“Business Transaction”), and as part of the Business Transaction, each party anticipates that it will disclose to the other party certain information that its deems confidential and/or proprietary.
Now, therefore, to assure the confidentiality of the parties’ confidential information and to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of this information, UHS and Company agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information Defined. The term “Confidential Information” means all confidential and proprietary information belonging to one party (the “Disclosing Party”) that is revealed to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) during the Disclosure Period, which begins on the effective date and ends April 26, 2011. Confidential Information, regardless of the form in which it appears, may include, without limitation, information about customers, business and marketing plans, financial data, expertise of employees, forecasts and strategies that is related to the business of the Disclosing Party and is of the type of information that would reasonably be deemed to be confidential.
2. Use Restriction. The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information for the sole purpose of evaluating and negotiating the Business Transaction.
3. Disclosure Restrictions and Exceptions. The Receiving Party will disclose Confidential Information only to its employees and to its representative whose participation is necessary or helpful to evaluate and advance to the Business Transaction and who have agreed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party will limit the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Receiving Party is not prohibited from disclosing Confidential Information it is legally compelled to disclose (by deposition, subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order or otherwise), provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of any such required disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained and the Disclosing Party has not waived compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Party is advised by opinion of counsel it is legally required to furnish and will exercise reasonable efforts to limit the scope and content of such disclosure and obtain confidential treatment of such Confidential Information, Furthermore, the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement do not apply with respect to any Confidential Information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than from the improper action of the Receiving Party, (b) is developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, (c) was in the Receiving Party’s possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (d) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party.
4. Nondisclosure of Possible Business Transaction. Except as permitted by the previous paragraph, neither the Receiving Party nor the Receiving Party’s representatives will disclose to any person the fact that the Confidential information has been made available to the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s representatives or that the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s representatives have inspected any portion of the Confidential Information.
5. Waiver. The failure of a party to insist, in one or more instances, upon performance of any of the provisions or conditions of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any other provision or condition of this Agreement, and no present waiver will be construed as a future waiver of such provision or condition.
6. Remedies. Because of the unique and proprietary nature of Confidential Information, it is understood and agreed that remedies at law for a breach by the Receiving Party of its obligations under this Agreement may be inadequate and that in the event of such breach or threatened breach the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance. The remedies set forth in this Section are in addition to any other remedies available for any such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the breaching party.
7. Assignment. This Agreement is not assignable by either party without the prior express written consent of the other, except that UHS may assign this Agreement to an affiliate or to a successor in interest to which the business relates.
8. Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement states the entire understanding of the parties regarding the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and it cannot be altered or amended without a writing signed by both parties. This Agreement will not be construed to create any obligation on the part of either party to retain the other party’s services or to compensate the other party in any manner.
9. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all documents or other materials furnished by the Disclosing Party constituting Confidential Information, together with all copies thereof in the possession, custody or control of the Receiving Party, without retaining any copies. Any destruction must be confirmed by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Receiving Party is not required to return or destroy computer files stored in the ordinary course of its business as a result of automated back-up procedures (subject, however, to the confidentiality restrictions set forth herein).
10. Term. The Receiving Party’s obligations imposed pursuant to this Agreement will continue for two years from the date hereof. ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into and effective as of the 28 day of November, 2017, by and between:
Blackstreet Capital Holdings, LLC, a Delaware LLC having the address specified on the signature page (the “Potential Acquiror”)
- and -
the undersigned Potential Acquiree, a Delaware corporation, having the address specified on the signature page (the “Company”)
RECITALS:
A. The parties to this Agreement want to enter into discussions concerning a potential business transaction, including a potential acquisition transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”).
B. In connection with such discussions, the parties contemplate exchanging information, including confidential and proprietary information.
C. Each party agrees to protect the proprietary and confidential information of the other.
NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree to the following:
Scope of Confidential Information
1. “Confidential Information” means, for each party, whether in oral, written or in electronic form:
(i) any information, data, intellectual property (including trade secrets), facts and financial information relating to the existing or proposed business, products, customers or services of such party and its affiliates that are treated as confidential by it, or ought to be considered confidential from their nature or the circumstances surrounding their disclosure; (ii) the existence of, and either party's potential participation in, the Proposed Transaction (including the contents and details of any discussions and negotiations of the terms, conditions and other matters with respect thereto); and (iii) any reports, analyses, forecasts, memoranda, compilations, studies, notes or summaries of such information, or other written or electronic documents prepared by, or on behalf of or for the Recipient or affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, members or other equity holders, agents or advisors (“Representatives”) of the Recipient, to the extent that they use, contain, relate to, reflect, or are derived from such information (collectively, “Derivative Confidential Information”).
2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information which would otherwise be considered “Confidential Information”, is not subject to the terms of this Agreement if such information is:
(a) in the public domain other than as a consequence of a breach of the obligations contained in this Agreement or other duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information;
(b) known by the party receiving the Confidential Information (the “Recipient”) prior to the disclosure of the Confidential Information by the disclosing party (the “Disclosing Party”) without any other obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party;
(c) independently developed by the Recipient without breach of this Agreement or other duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information; or
(d) received by the Recipient from a third party who is not subject to obligations similar to the obligations contained in this Agreement, including any duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information.
Obligation to Maintain Confidentiality
3. The Recipient will keep, and will cause its Representatives to keep, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party confidential. The Recipient will not disclose the Confidential Information or use or permit the Confidential Information to be disclosed or used, to or by any person except Recipient’s Representatives, in each case, who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. In any such case Confidential Information will be disclosed only to those Representatives with a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of the Proposed Transaction, and (iv) only so much of the Confidential Information as is necessary for a particular individual to perform his or her function will be disclosed to that individual. Under no circumstances shall the Recipient or its Representatives use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose other than evaluating and negotiating the Proposed Transaction. In any event, the Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.
4. The Recipient agrees to take all reasonable steps (including those steps that the Recipient takes to protect its own information, data or other tangible or intangible property that it regards as confidential) to ensure the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
5. Except as provided in Section 3, the Recipient will not, without the consent of the Disclosing Party, (i) disclose to any person the fact that it has obtained the Confidential Information, or (ii) make any disclosure respecting any Proposed Transaction between the parties to any third party, including, without limitation, any suppliers, customers or clients of each party.
6. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may disclose to other potential parties for a Proposed Transaction that it is considering or negotiating a Proposed transaction and the terms and conditions thereof, but may not disclose the involvement of the Company or any other information identifying the involvement of the Company.
7. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Representatives may disclose Confidential Information to the extent necessary to defend any litigation claim or cause of action brought against it by the other party relating to the Proposed Transaction or this Agreement; provided that the Disclosing Party agrees to use (and to cause its applicable Representatives to use) reasonable efforts, at the other party's expense, to obtain assurances that any such disclosed Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.
8. If the Recipient, or anyone else to whom Confidential Information is provided as permitted by this Agreement, receives notice indicating that it may or will be legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, Recipient will make a reasonable effort to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek, at its expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this Agreement. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained for whatever reason, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with this Agreement, the compelled person will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which Recipient is informed by advice of its counsel that it is required to disclose.
Ownership of Confidential Information
9. All right, title and interest in and to a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and the Confidential Information will be held in trust and confidence by the Recipient and its Representatives. No interest, license or any right respecting the Confidential Information, other than expressly set out in this Agreement, is granted to the Recipient under this Agreement by implication or otherwise.
10. All written, electronic or oral information that contains any part of a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information (including any Derivative Confidential Information) will remain the property of the Disclosing Party.
Return or Destruction of Confidential Information
11. The Recipient will, within five business days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, confirm that it has destroyed the original provided to Recipient (and all copies made by it) any documents (in whatever form or medium) provided, or made available for review by, the Disclosing Party (including any Derivative Confidential Information). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the parties agree that destruction will not be made of (i) any electronic copy of any Confidential Information that was created pursuant to the standard electronic backup and archival procedures of the Recipient if (x) personnel of the Recipient whose functions are not primarily internal information technology in nature do not have access to such retained copies and (y) personnel of the Recipient whose functions are primarily internal information technology in nature have access to such copies only as reasonably necessary for the performance of their internal information technology duties (e.g., for purposes of system recovery). The parties further agree that they will continue to treat as confidential in accordance with the Agreement, any Confidential Information retained pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 11.
No Liability Regarding Confidential Information
12. The Recipient acknowledges that (i) the Disclosing Party is not obligated to provide any information pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the Confidential Information is being given to it without liability on the part of the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, and (iii) no representation or warranty with respect to the Confidential Information is made by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives. The Recipient agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or its Representatives.
General
13. The Recipient agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives, and that any court having competent jurisdiction may enter a preliminary and/or permanent restraining order, injunction or order for specific performance, without posting any bond, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity available to the Disclosing Party.

CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This agreement, made as of January 28, 2014 (the “Effective date”), between Vapotherm, Inc. (“Vapotherm”), a corporation located at 22 Industrial Drive, Exeter, NH 03833 and organized under the laws of Delaware, and John Coolidge, located at xxx (the “Receiving Party”).
WHEREAS Vapotherm is in the business of developing medical device technology (the “Technology”), and Vapotherm wishes to preserve the secrecy of that Technology.
WHEREAS Vapotherm desires to provide Confidential Information to Receiving Party for the specific purposes identified herein, and Receiving Party desires to obtain and evaluate such Confidential Information from Vapotherm for the specific purposes identified herein.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of mutual covenants and mutual promises set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Definition. “Confidential Information” shall, mean all intellectual property, business plans, financial records and strategies, marketing plans, contacts, trade secrets, information, materials, documentation and software, as well as copies of all such materials made thereof as authorized by this Agreement, including written, oral, or verbal disclosures. “Confidential Information” shall not include:
a. Information that was in the public domain, in its entirety in a unified form, at the time of disclosure to Receiving Party by Vapotherm;
b. Information known to Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by Vapotherm, such prior knowledge to be demonstrated by Receiving Party’s records prepared before the date the Confidential Information is disclosed by Vapotherm;
c. Information that becomes part of the public domain after the date of disclosure by Vapotherm through no fault of Receiving Party;
d. Information that is disclosed by a third party to Receiving Party after the date of disclosure by Vapotherm, where the third party did not require Receiving Party to hold such information in confidence and did not acquire such information directly or indirectly from Vapotherm.
2. Purpose. Vapotherm agrees to disclose the Confidential Information only for the following specific purpose (‘Permitted Purpose”): ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________
3. Nondisclosure. The Receiving Party agrees that, in consideration of access to the Confidential Information, it shall hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall take all measures necessary to prevent the Confidential Information from falling into the public domain or into the possession of the persons not bound to this Agreement. The Receiving Party further agrees:
a. To use Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose;
b. Not to disclose Confidential Information to any other entity, except as expressly authorized in writing by Vapotherm;
c. Not to use Confidential Information in such a way as to hinder, interfere with, or in any way circumvent Vapotherm’s interest in the Technology, or consulting or business relations between and among Vapotherm and third parties;
d. Not to copy Confidential Information in whole or in part, without the express written permission of Vapotherm;
e. To return Confidential Information, including all copies and records thereof, to Vapotherm, at the Receiving Party’s expense, within five (5) business days after: (i) receipt of a written request from Vapotherm; (ii) a decision by Receiving Party not to enter into any consulting relationship with Vapotherm; or, (iii) within thirty (30) days following the termination of this Agreement.
4. Receiving Party’s Procedures. Receiving Party shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of its employees, agents and independent contractors who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose. Receiving Party shall require all employees, agents and independent contractors who have access to Confidential Information to execute a confidentiality agreement limiting their use of such information to the Permitted Purpose and prohibiting them from disclosing such information to third parties.
5. Injunctive Relief. Because of the unique nature of the Confidential information, the Receiving Party understands and agrees that Vapotherm will suffer irreparable harm in the event that any party hereto fails to comply with any of the terms of the Agreement, and monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate such breach. Accordingly, the Receiving Party agrees that Vapotherm will, in addition to any other remedies available to it at law or in equity, be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement.
6. Misuse of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall promptly advise Vapotherm, in writing, of any misappropriation or misuse of the Confidential Information, by any entity, which may come to its attention.
7. Inventions. Inventions means all discoveries, improvements, modifications and enhancements relating to the Technology that are conceived, developed or reduced to practice by Receiving Party during die Term, either solely or jointly with others: (i) during the course of or as a result of performing the Permitted Purpose, or (ii) that are related to or attributable to Vapotherm’s products, or later modifications thereof, whether patentable or not, and all Intellectual Property rights therein. All Inventions will be immediately reported to Vapotherm and shall be the exclusive property of Vapotherm. The Receiving Party will perform, at Vapotherm’s request and expense, any act which it can reasonably perform that Vapotherm deems necessary to vest title to such inventions and ideas in Vapotherm and to execute any and all patent applications in connection therewith.
8. Government Order. In the event that the Receiving Party is ordered to disclose the Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or governmental request, requirement or order, Receiving Party shall immediately notify Vapotherm and take reasonable steps to assist Vapotherm in contesting such request, requirement or order or otherwise protecting Vapotherm’s rights.
9. Compliance With Export Restrictions. The Receiving Party will not export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from Vapotherm under this Agreement or any product utilizing any such data to any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval.
10. No Warranties. The Receiving Party acknowledges that Confidential Information may still be under development, or may be incomplete, and that such information may relate to products that are under development or are planned for development. VAPOTHERM MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF THIS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Vapotherm accepts no responsibility for any expenses, losses or action incurred or undertaken by Receiving Party as a result of Receiving Party’s receipt or use of Confidential Information. VAPOTHERM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT IT WILL INTRODUCE ANY PRODUCT RELATING TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
11. Survival. The restrictions and obligations of this Agreement shall continue and shall survive the termination of the Purpose of the disclosure for a period of five (5) years.
12. Interpretation; Venue. This Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its choice of law provisions. The parties agree that any legal action or proceedings brought by or against them with respect to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, USA and, by execution and delivery hereof, the parties hereby irrevocably submit to each such jurisdiction and hereby irrevocably waive any and all objections which they may have with respect to venue in any of the above courts.
13. Division/Separation. This Agreement is divisible and separable so that if any provision(s) hereof shall be held to be invalid, such holdings shall not impair enforcement or validity of the remaining provisions hereof. If any provision is held to be too broad to be enforced, such provision shall be construed to create an obligation to the full extent allowable by law.
14. Entire Understanding. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the specific subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes and replaces any and all prior understandings, arrangements and/or agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the Technology.
15. Waiver. Waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of the underlying obligations of this Agreement.
16. Right in Confidential Information. No license or other right is created or granted hereby, except the specific right to receive the Confidential Information and evaluate it as set forth herein, nor shall any license or any other right with respect to the subject matter hereof be created or granted except by written agreement signed by the duly authorized representative of each of the parties hereto.
17. Modification. No addition to, deletion from, or modification of the provisions of this Agreement shall be permitted or shall be binding upon a party hereto unless made in writing and signed by each party.
18. Assignment. The rights and obligations herein shall bind the parties, their legal representatives, successors, heirs, and assigns.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed and delivered this Agreement on the date first above written.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
December 15, 2010
Verizon Communications Inc.
140 West Street
New York, New York 10007
Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have indicated an interest in evaluating a potential acquisition (the “Transaction”) of Terremark Worldwide, Inc. (the “Company”). In evaluating the Transaction, you have requested certain information regarding the Company and the Transaction from the Company. As a condition to your receipt of such information, you agree to treat any information concerning the Transaction or the Company which is furnished to you in connection with evaluating the Transaction (all such information, collectively, the “Confidential Information”) in accordance with the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement (this “Agreement”) and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions herein set forth.
1. You hereby agree that the Confidential Information will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and implementing the Transaction and that such information will be kept confidential by you; provided that any such information may be disclosed to your officers, directors, employees, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, consultants, other agents or representatives and financing sources (such Persons hereinafter collectively being referred to as your “Representatives” who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating and implementing the Transaction, have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and have been advised that such information is to be kept confidential, and provided, further, that such officers, directors, employees, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, consultants, other agents or representatives and financing sources shall not be deemed to be your Representatives unless (but solely to the extent that) you furnish Confidential Information to them. You agree you will be liable for any breaches of the terms of this Agreement by such Representatives.
You and the Company also each agree, on behalf of itself, its affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, disclose to any Person the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to you, that discussions or negotiations have taken place or are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof.
2. The term “Confidential Information” does not include any information which (a) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives in breach of this Agreement), (b) was available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company, (c) becomes available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known by you or your Representatives (as applicable) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company, or is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to you or your Representatives (as applicable), or (d) is or was independently developed by you or your Representatives without reference to, incorporation of, or other use of any Confidential Information.
3. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and our current discussions, the Company may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information and you and the Company may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of our discussions or by any breach of this Agreement by you, the Company or the Representatives of you and the Company. Without prejudice to other rights and remedies otherwise available, you and the Company therefore agree that the other party hereto shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other party hereto or the Representatives of the other party hereto.
4. In the event you or any of your Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand, order or similar process) to disclose any of the contents of the Confidential Information, or you or the Company or any of the respective Representatives of you or the Company become so legally compelled to disclose either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction between the Company and you, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof, the Company and you each agrees that each party and its respective Representatives may do so without liability, but each party hereto also agrees (i) to promptly notify the other party prior to any such disclosure to the extent practicable and legally permissible and (ii) to cooperate with the other party in any attempt it may make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Confidential Information.
5. The Company may elect at any time to terminate further access by you to the Confidential Information. Following any written request by the Company, you agree, at the Company’s election, to either promptly redeliver to the Company or destroy all written Confidential Information in your possession or your Representatives’ possession, and you and your Representatives will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material. You further agree that all documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by you or your Representatives based on the Confidential Information shall be destroyed, and you shall delete, to the extent reasonably practicable, all Confidential Information from any computer or other electronic device. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such destruction or deletion shall be
required where prohibited by law, regulation, regulatory process or proceeding, or stock exchange regulation, or where the Confidential Information is part of the record of proceedings of your Board of Directors; provided, that any such Confidential Information so retained shall continue to be held confidential in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
6. You and the Company also agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into between the Company and you with respect to the Transaction, neither the Company nor you will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Nothing contained in any discussions between you and the Company or in any Confidential Information shall be deemed to constitute a representation or warranty. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.
7. You agree that certain Confidential Information may be deemed material non-public information under applicable securities laws. Without limitation of the other restrictions on use or transfer of Confidential Information described herein, you agree that while such information remains non-public, you will not engage, and will direct your Representatives not to engage, in any transactions in the securities of the Company in a manner which would constitute a violation of such laws.
8. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of (a) 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on February 3, 2011 and (b) the execution of a definitive agreement between the Company and you relating to a Transaction, except for discussions with you regarding the Transaction, the Company and its affiliates shall not, and the Company shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (w) solicit or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to any offer or proposal to (i) sell, issue or otherwise transfer any equity securities (or securities convertible or exchangeable for equity securities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (except in accordance with the terms of convertible securities outstanding on the date hereof and pursuant to employment arrangements entered into in the ordinary course from time to time), (ii) sell or otherwise transfer any material assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) effect any recapitalization, refinancing, restructuring, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (any of the foregoing hereinafter referred to as an “Alternative Proposal”), (x) solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any Alternative Proposal, or (y) have any discussions with or provide any non-public information or data to any third party that would encourage, facilitate or further any effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal.
9, Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of a definitive agreement, if any, with respect to the Transaction and without prejudice thereto, each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that none of the other party or any of such other party’s respective Representatives and none of the respective officers, directors, partners, shareholders, members, employees, agents or persons in control of such other party’s Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty to such party, such party’s Representatives or to any other person as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information furnished by or on behalf of such party, and each party hereto hereby further acknowledges and agrees that none of such persons shall have any liability to the other party or any of such other party’s Representatives relating to or arising from or in connection with such other party’s use or the use by such other party’s Representatives of any Confidential Information furnished by or on behalf of such party to such other party or its respective Representatives or for any inaccuracies contained therein or any omissions therefrom. Each party hereto also acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information furnished to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of the other party and that such party shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties as may be made to it and contained expressly in any definitive agreement with respect to the Transaction, to the extent in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in any such definitive agreement.
10. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consents to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America located in the State of New York for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement (and irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to commence any such action, suit, or proceeding except in such courts), (b) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such courts and (c) waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
11 The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding solely upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. The Company agrees that you may assign all rights, powers, privileges, and obligations under this Agreement with respect to any or all of the proposed Transaction to any of your affiliates.
12. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto and may be modified only by a separate written agreement executed by you and the Company expressly modifying this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes and cancels any and all prior agreements between the parties hereto, express or implied, relating to the Transaction; provided that the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of November 13, 2009 between the parties hereto shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the matters contemplated thereby.
13. For purposes of this Agreement, “Person” shall be broadly interpreted to include any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other group or entity (including any court, government or agency, commission, board or authority thereof, federal, state or local, domestic, foreign or multinational).
14. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) the closing of the Transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) one (1) year after the date hereof.
15. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.

MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT
 This Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this ""Agreement"") is made as of September 6, 2001 between EarthLink, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""EarthLink""), and CIDCO, Incorporated., a Delaware corporation (""CIDCO""). EarthLink and CIDCO are sometimes referred to herein individually as a ""Party"" and collectively as the ""Parties.""
 1. Purpose. EarthLink and CIDCO wish to have discussions relating to a potential transaction (the ""Transaction"") between EarthLink (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders) and CIDCO (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders). In the course of such discussions, each Party expects to make available to the other Party and its Representatives (as defined herein) Evaluation Material (as defined herein) concerning the businesses, financial condition, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, and prospects of such Party. As a condition to making such information available, each Party is entering this Agreement and agrees that all Evaluation Material received by it or its Representatives from the other Party or any of its Representatives shall be treated in accordance with this Agreement.
 2. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) the term ""Receiving Party"" means the Party receiving Evaluation Material; (ii) the term ""Furnishing Party"" means the Party providing Evaluation Material or causing Evaluation Material to be provided; (iii) the term ""Representatives"" means the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors engaged in connection with the review and evaluation of the Transaction) of the specified Party; and (iv) the term ""Evaluation Material"" means all proprietary and confidential information concerning the Furnishing Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in verbal, visual, written, electronic or other form, which is made available by the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Primary Evaluation Material""), together, in each case, with all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, studies, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based in whole or in part thereon prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Derivative Evaluation Material""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term ""Evaluation Material"" shall not include, and the Parties' obligations herein (other than their obligations under paragraph 6 of this Agreement) shall not extend to, information which (a) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Furnishing Party; (b) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Evaluation Material; (c) is now or hereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party's Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives and such source is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party following reasonable inquiry, under any obligation to the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to keep such information confidential; or (e) is transmitted by or on behalf of the Furnishing Party after receiving written notification from the Receiving Party of the termination of discussions relating to the Transaction or written instructions from the Receiving Party not to furnish any further Evaluation Material.
 3. Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material.
 (a) Confidentiality of Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material (i) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and considering the Transaction; (ii) shall be kept strictly confidential by the Receiving Party; and (iii) shall be provided by the Receiving Party solely to those of its Representatives to whom disclosure is reasonably required to facilitate the Receiving Party's evaluation or consideration of the Transaction, it being the intention of the Parties to restrict the dissemination of Evaluation Material to as small a working group as practicable. The Parties agree that all Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Furnishing Party. Before providing access to Evaluation Material to any Representative, the Receiving Party shall inform such Representative of the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and shall advise such Representative that, by accepting possession of or access to such information, such Representative is agreeing to be bound by this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.
 (b) Compulsory Disclosure of Evaluation Material. If the Receiving Party or its Representatives are requested or required in any judicial, arbital or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or otherwise), or the Receiving Party is so requested or required to disclose any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under paragraph (3)(c) of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall give the Furnishing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Furnishing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall reasonably cooperate with the Furnishing Party in seeking such an order. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the opinion of the Receiving Party's or (in the case of disclosure requested or required of a Representative, such Representative's) outside counsel or General Counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall use all requisite reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material to the extent such assurances are available. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Receiving Party may disclose Evaluation Material under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b) without liability hereunder.
 (c) Other Public Disclosure. Except (i) for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party consistent with advice of counsel, for the disclosing Party not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or order, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall:
 (x) make any disclosure (and each Party shall direct its Representatives not to make any disclosure) to any person of (A) the fact that discussions, negotiations or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, or the fact that either Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or (C) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any proposed Transaction, including the status of the discussions or negotiations related thereto, or
 (y) make any public statement concerning a proposed Transaction.
 (d) Notice. If either Party proposes to make any disclosure in reliance on clause (i) above, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party with the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and shall in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the other Party concerning the nature and scope of the information it proposes to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may make such public announcement or public statement if in the opinion of such Party's outside counsel or General Counsel, such public announcement or public statement is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or of any rule or regulation of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system on which such Party's securities are listed or trade. In such event, the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to give advance notice to the other Party and to consult with the other Party on the timing and content of any such public announcement or public statement.
 (e) Certain Securities Law Restrictions. Each Party acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may contain material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party. Each Party further acknowledges its awareness of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on persons in possession of material nonpublic information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either Party that any Evaluation Material in fact contains material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party.
 (f) Contact with Employees and Representatives. Neither Party shall communicate with any employee of the other Party regarding the Transaction or disclose any Evaluation Material to any employee or Representative of the other Party, other than the employees and Representatives named on the working group lists provided by the Parties from time to time.
 (g) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party will be restricted from using the information contained in the Evaluation Material that is retained in the minds of Representatives who have had access to the other Party's Evaluation Material, unless such use shall infringe on any of such Party's patent rights, trademark rights or copyright rights.
 4. Accuracy of Evaluation Material; No Representations or Warranties. Each Party acknowledges and agrees (a) that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by either Party or any of its respective Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (b) that the Parties shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties (if any) that may be made in a definitive written agreement for the Transaction, signed and delivered by both Parties, and then only to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided therein.
 5. No Solicitation. For a period of one year subsequent to the termination of discussions regarding a Transaction, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by the other Party (or any of its subsidiaries) with whom the hiring Party first has contact, or who first becomes known to the hiring Party, in the course of the Parties' discussions and due diligence with respect to the proposed Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either Party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring Party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring Party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring Party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other Party or (iii) is identified by a third party executive search firm or employment agency without any assistance from such Party.
 6. Return and Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time after termination of discussions by either Party with respect to the Transaction, upon the request of the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly (and in no event later than five business days after such request) (a) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the Furnishing Party all copies of all Primary Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is in a visual or written format and erase or destroy all copies of all such Primary Evaluation Material which is stored in electronic format, and (b) destroy or cause to be destroyed all Derivative Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Nothing herein shall obligate the Receiving Party to provide any Derivative Evaluation Material to the Furnishing Party. Notwithstanding the return, destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material hereunder, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
 7. Remedies. Each Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this Agreement by it or any of its Representatives, and that in addition to all other remedies which either Party may have, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that either Party should institute proceedings to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all expenses relating to the enforcement of this Agreement, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies.
 8. Communications. CIDCO recognizes EarthLink will incur substantial expenses in conducting a due diligence investigation of CIDCO, and in consideration for EarthLink's doing so, CIDCO agrees to cease and terminate immediately, and to cause its Representatives to cease and terminate immediately, any negotiations (other than with EarthLink and its Representatives) with respect to any proposals relating to any business combination, tender offer or acquisition transaction involving the acquisition by any third party of all or any portion of the stock or assets of CIDCO (any such proposal being a ""Third-Party Offer"" and any such acquisition being a ""Third-Party Acquisition""). In addition, CIDCO agrees that from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date a definitive agreement for EarthLink's acquisition of CIDCO is executed, or (b) October 31, 2001 (as the same may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties, the ""Restricted Period""), CIDCO will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its Representatives, to directly or indirectly, solicit, consider or encourage any inquiries or proposals for (or which may reasonably be expected to lead to) any Third-Party Offer, or engage in discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications with or provide any information to, or otherwise assist or cooperate with any person, entity or group in connection with any Third-Party Offer. Immediately upon receipt of any Third-Party Offer or related inquiry during such period, CIDCO agrees to inform EarthLink of the fact of such Third-Party Offer or related inquiry, including, among other things, the identity of the third-party making such offer or inquiry. Without limiting its application to the entirety of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, including without limitation EarthLink's remedies of specific performance and injunction, shall be specifically applicable to violations of this first paragraph of Section 8.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 8 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of CIDCO from, only to the minimum extent required, complying with the mandatory disclosure requirements of Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with regard to an unsolicited Third-Party Offer, pursuant to advice of outside legal counsel, provided, that any recommendation by the Board of Directors other than to recommend rejection of such offer shall be considered an immediate breach of this Section 8.
 In consideration of the efforts and resources to be expended by EarthLink in its due diligence investigation of CIDCO and related matters, CIDCO agrees that in the event that it violates any provision of the first or second paragraphs of this Section 8 in any manner during the Restricted Period, CIDCO shall become liable to pay, and shall immediately pay, to EarthLink One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) plus the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of EarthLink including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other professional charges incurred by EarthLink in connection with the proposed Transaction. The parties hereby agree that EarthLink would be substantially harmed as a result of such a violation of this Section 8, that the specific damages incurred by EarthLink would be difficult of determination, and that this amount constitutes a reasonable estimate of such damages to be incurred by EarthLink and shall constitute reasonable liquidated damages for a breach of this Section 8.
 9. Miscellaneous.
 (a) No License. Neither Party grants a license, by implication or otherwise, under any of its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to the Receiving Party. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other Party's Evaluation Material. The Furnishing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently or in the future develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Material. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for it products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Evaluation Material, provided that
the Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.
 (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the confidentiality of their discussions, negotiations and investigations concerning a Transaction.
 (c) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Parties.
 (d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement unless the enforcement of such provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.
 (e) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement to consummate a Transaction, to conduct or continue negotiations with respect to a Transaction, or to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, and neither Party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or by virtue of any other written or oral expression by the Parties' respective Representatives unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction is executed and delivered by both Parties, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Both Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not to provide Evaluation Material to the Receiving Party under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. If either Party determines not to proceed with negotiations with respect to a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of such determination.
 (f) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws thereof. Each Party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of Georgia, and the city of Atlanta, for the adjudication of any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
In connection with a potential transaction (“Proposed Transaction”) between 3M Company (“Interested Party” or “Receiving Party”), and Cogent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Company” or “Disclosing Party”), the parties wish to protect and preserve the confidential and/or proprietary nature of certain information and materials of the Company that may be disclosed or made available to the Interested Party or its Representatives (as defined below) in connection with certain discussions, negotiations or dealings between the parties relating to the Proposed Transaction.
In consideration of the foregoing and the rights and obligations set forth herein, both parties hereby agree as of July 31, 2008 (the “Effective Date”):
1. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND OTHER DEFINITIONS.
1.1 “Proprietary Information” means any and all information and material disclosed by Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives in connection with the Proposed Transaction or in the course of the parties’ evaluation and negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, together with all communications, data, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, records, notes, lists, financial statements or other materials or information prepared by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that contain or otherwise reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party or that reflect the review of, interest in, or evaluation of all or any portion of the Proposed Transaction or Disclosing Party’s business (collectively, “Derived Information”), whether tangible or intangible, furnished or prepared in writing or in oral, graphic, electronic or any other form or manner. In addition, Proprietary Information shall include (x) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Proposed Transaction or that Interested Party has made or may make an offer to acquire Company’s stock or assets or that any Proprietary Information has been shared between the parties and their respective Representatives in connection therewith, (y) the proposed terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction (including any financial terms and conditions) and the status thereof, and (z) the existence, context, and scope of this Agreement.
Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or other action or inaction by Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement (including any disclosure or other action or inaction by Representatives of Receiving Party that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if undertaken by Receiving Party itself); (ii) is or becomes known or avai1able to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than Disclosing Party or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives) that, to the best of the knowledge of Receiving Party, is not prohibited from disclosing such Proprietary Information to Receiving Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (iii) is or was independently developed by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without violation of any obligation under this Agreement.
1.2 “Representatives” means as to any person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, accountants and their respective Representatives).
1.3 “person” shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.
2. NON-DISCLOSURE AND LIMITED USE.
2.1 Non-Disclosure. Without the written consent of Disclosing Party and except as otherwise required by applicable law, Receiving Party shall keep, and shall cause its Representatives to keep, all Proprietary Information confidential and shall not disclose or reveal, and shall cause its Representatives not to disclose or reveal, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information to any person, other than to its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction and who are bound by restrictions regarding the disclosure and use of such Proprietary Information (either contractual, legal or fiduciary) owed to Company, Interested Party or any their respective Representatives that are comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement. Each party shall inform all of its respective Representatives and shall cause its respective Representatives to inform their Representatives who receive Proprietary Information hereunder of the confidential nature of such information and the Proposed Transaction, as well as the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction or in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.
2.2 Degree of Care. Receiving Party shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential proprietary information of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer (except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding a contractual obligation to the contrary) any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof, or determine or attempt to determine any source code, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof. Receiving Party shall not use Proprietary Information for any purpose or in any manner that would constitute a violation of any laws or regulations, including without limitation the export control laws of the United States.
2.3 Designated Representatives. Neither Interested Party nor its Representatives shall initiate or maintain contact with any officer, director, stockholder, employee or agent of Company or its subsidiaries regarding the Proposed Transaction, except with the express consent of Company. All (i) communications regarding the Proposed Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for on-site access or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to the Representatives designated by the Company.
2.4 Compelled Disclosure of Proprietary Information. If Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, my rule, regulation or policy statement of any national securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of Receiving Party’s securities are listed or quoted) or by legal process to disclose any Proprietary Information, or any other information concerning Disclosing Party, its subsidiaries or affiliates, Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement, in order to enable Disclosing Party (a) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, (b) to consult with Receiving Party with respect to Disclosing Party’s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process or (c) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which Receiving Party is advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Proprietary Information so disclosed.
2.5 Attornev-Client Privilege. To the extent that any Proprietary Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that thy have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the disclosure of such material is not intended to, and
shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege and any such Proprietary Information shall remain entitled to all protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or my other applicable privilege.
2.6 Definitive Agreement. Until a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction has been executed by the parties hereto, neither party hereto shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Proposed Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (i) may conduct the process that may or may not result in the Proposed Transaction in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party) and (ii) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties’ consideration of the Proposed Transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party). For purposes of this Agreement, the term “definitive agreement” does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement in principle.
2.7 No Representations or Warranties Regarding Proprietary Information. Subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction and without prejudice thereto each party acknowledges that neither the other party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Proprietary Information or any use thereof. Each party hereby expressly disclaims all such warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and accuracy, and any warranties arising out of course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade. Receiving Party shall not be entitled to rely on the completeness of any Proprietary Information, but shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties regarding the completeness of the Proprietary Information as may be made to it in a definitive agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of any such agreement, should the discussions between the parties progress to such a point.
3. NO SOLICITATION
3.1 No Solicitation of Employees. Interested Party agrees that neither it nor its affiliates will at any time until the one year anniversary of the Effective Date, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for employment (i) any key technical or management personnel of the Company that has first been introduced by the Company to the Interested Party in connection with the Proposed Transaction or who was otherwise substantively involved in the discussions of the Proposed Transaction or (ii) any other person who is now employed as an officer of the other party or any of its affiliates; provided, that the foregoing restrictions hall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party or its Representatives from making general public solicitations for employment for any position or from employing any employee of the Company who either responds to such a general solicitation for employment or otherwise contacts Interested Party on his or her own initiative and without solicitation by Interested Party in contravention of the above restriction. Additionally, the above restriction shall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party from making offers of employment or offering retention packages to any employees of Company or any of its affiliates in connection with the Proposed Transaction, provided that such offers have been disclosed to the Board of Directors of the Company.
4. SECURITIES ISSUES.
4.1 No Public Disclosure Required. Each party expressly confirms and agrees that, as of the date hereof, it is not required to make any public disclosure with respect to (a) the Proposed Transaction (or the terms or conditions of any other acts relating thereto), (b) any item of Proprietary Information (or the fact that Proprietary Information bas been made available to such party), or (c) any discussions or negotiations taking place between the parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, whether pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or similar requirements related to general disclosure. If, after the date of this Agreement either party determines that any such disclosure is required, no such disclosure shall be made unless and until such party consults with the other party regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure, and provides the other party a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure and comment thereon.
4.2 Restrictions on Sales of Securities. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information. However, this will not prevent Receiving Party from purchasing stock through its benefit plans in the ordinary course of business.
5. OWNERSHIP.
All Proprietary Information (including without limitation, all copies, extracts and portions thereof) is and shall remain the sole property of Disclosing Party, provided, that all Derived Information shall be the sole property of Receiving Party. Receiving Party does not acquire (by license or otherwise, whether express or implied) any intellectual property rights or other rights under this Agreement or any disclosure hereunder, except the limited right to use such Proprietary Information in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. All rights relating to the Proprietary Information that are not expressly granted hereunder to Interested Party are reserved and retained by Disclosing Party.
6. TERM.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided that Sections 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 and Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
7. REMEDIES.
Receiving Party agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Proprietary Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Proprietary Information may cause injury to Disclosing Party, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Receiving Party agrees that Disclosing Company, in addition to any other available remedies, may have the right to seek an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement ordered by the court. Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party immediately if Receiving Party has reason to believe that any person who has had access to the Proprietary Information (including Receiving Party or any of its Representatives) has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement or otherwise disclose any Proprietary Information in violation of the terms hereof. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any ether remedy.
8. RETURN OF MATERIALS.
If either party hereto shall determine that it does not wish to proceed with the Proposed Transaction, such party shall promptly advise the other party of that decision. In that case, or if the
Proposed Transaction otherwise is not consummated for any reason, Receiving Party shall, upon Disclosing Party’s written request, promptly deliver to Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information, and, at Disclosing Party’s sole election, return or destroy (provided that my such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of Receiving Party) all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or on intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in Receiving Party’s or any of its Representatives’ possession; provided, that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Proprietary Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered. However, Receiving Party may retain in the office of its legal counsel, one copy of Proprietary Information for record purposes only. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of any Proprietary Information, or documents or material containing or reflecting any Proprietary Information, the parties will continue to be bound by their obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for the term of this Agreement (or such other term as may be applicable to the specific obligation), except as otherwise specifically provided herein.
9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information in connection with the Proposed Transaction and related matters and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions.

9.3 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized signatories of both parties. The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of or a default under the same or any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power, privilege or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other further exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder.
9.4 Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

The parties hereto specifically waive any right to a jury trial with respect to any matter arising under this Agreement.
9.6 Expenses.

March 17, 2010
FLIR Systems, Inc.
27700 SW Parkway Ave.
Wilsonville. OR 97070
Attention: Mr. Craig Stoehr
Director - Corporate Development and Investor Relations
Confidentiality Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In connection with your consideration of a possible transaction (a “Transaction”) involving ICx Technologies, Inc. or certain of its affiliates, subsidiaries, assets and/or business divisions (collectively, the “Company”), you have requested information. In consideration of, and as a condition to, your being furnished with such information and any other Evaluation Material (as defined below), the Company hereby requests your agreement as set forth herein. As used in this letter agreement (this “Agreement”), the term “Evaluation Material” means all information regarding the Company, its businesses, technology, products, prospects and plans, a Transaction or the fact that the Company may pursue a Transaction with you or other parties, the existence and terms of this Letter Agreement and other information furnished to you in connection with the Transaction by the Company or any of its Representatives (as defined below), irrespective of form or medium of communication, whether prepared by the Company, its Representatives or otherwise and whether furnished before, on or after the date of this Agreement, together with any and all analyses, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other materials prepared by you or your Representatives that contain, are based on or otherwise incorporate, in whole or part, such information. The term “Representatives” includes, without limitation, FLIR Systems, Inc.’s affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, representatives, financial institutions providing or underwriting solely debt financing or “controlling persons” (within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)); provided, that, should you provide Evaluation Material to any such financial institution seeking to arrange debt financing, you shall promptly provide written notice to the Company as to the identity of any such financial institution. The Company is being advised by Stone Key Partners LLC and the Stone Key Securities division of Hudson Partners Securities LLC (together, “Stone Key”).
Use of Evaluation Materials
You and your Representatives (i) will use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company involving you or your affiliates and (ii) will keep the Evaluation Material strictly confidential and (except as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process, and only after compliance with the paragraph titled “Compelled Disclosure” below) will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, disclose any information in the Evaluation Material to any person, except that the Evaluation Material (or portions thereof) may be disclosed to those of your Representatives who need to know such information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company (it being understood that prior to such disclosure your Representatives will be informed of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Material, will be provided with a copy of this Agreement and will agree to be bound by the terms hereof). You will make all reasonable, necessary and appropriate efforts to safeguard Evaluation Material from disclosure to anyone other than as permitted hereby. You agree to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your Representatives (including, without limitation, any actions or inactions by your Representatives that would constitute a breach if such Representatives were original signatories hereto).
The term “Evaluation Material” does not include any information which (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives) or (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a person not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or its Representatives or prohibited from transmitting the information to you by law, contractual obligation, fiduciary duly or otherwise. As used in this Agreement, the term “person” shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, joint venture, partnership, association or individual. You agree that the Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates, as applicable, and that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives, subsidiaries or affiliates has granted you any license, copyright, or similar right with respect to any of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you by or on behalf of the Company.
Non-Disclosure
Unless otherwise required by applicable law in the reasonable written opinion of your legal counsel, but only after compliance with the paragraph titled “Compelled Disclosure” below, neither you nor your Representatives will, without the Company’s prior written consent, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including, without limitation, the status thereof, the existence and terms of this Agreement and the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available to you. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby expressly confirm and agree that no public disclosure with respect to any discussions or negotiations concerning a possible Transaction is now required by reason of securities laws or similar requirements related to general disclosure and in the event you determine that such disclosure is required in the future, no such disclosures shall be made unless and until you have consulted, to the extent permitted by applicable law or cognizant authority, with the Company regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure and otherwise complied with this paragraph.
Without limitation of the foregoing, you further agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, enter in any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or any discussions which might lead to an agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any person regarding participation in a possible Transaction as a principal, coinvestor, an equity investor or any person other than a financial institution providing or underwriting debt financing. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Representatives” as applied to you shall not include any such potential principal, co-investor, equity investor or person other than a financial institution providing or underwriting debt financing.
Compelled Disclosure
In the event that you are requested or required to disclose all or any part of the information contained in the Evaluation Material pursuant to the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a federal, state or local governmental or regulatory body or pursuant to a civil investigative demand or similar judicial process or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law or cognizant authority, you will (i) notify the Company in writing immediately of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request or requirement, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request or requirement, (iii) if disclosure of any such information is required, disclose only that portion of the information which, upon written advice of your legal counsel, you are legally required to disclose and (iv) exercise your best efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. In any event, you will cooperate with the Company to obtain such a protective order or other assurance. Any expense you incur in connection with the Company’s desire to narrow or limit the scope of the request or requirement shall be the responsibility of the Company.
Non-Solicitation of Employees
Until the earlier of (i) the consummation by you of a Transaction, (ii) eighteen months after termination of discussions relating to a possible Transaction between you and the Company, and (iii) two years from the date of this Agreement, you will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire, entice away or offer to enter into any contract with, or hire any employee of the Company: provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from engagement in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to the Company’s employees or hiring employees who respond to such a solicitation with no other action or by you or your Representatives in violation of this provision: and provided, further, that, following execution by you and the Company of a definitive agreement providing for a Transaction between you and the Company, this paragraph shall not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from offering employees employment in anticipation of and conditioned upon the consummation of such Transaction.
Standstill
You represent and warrant to the Company that, as of the date hereof, you do not beneficially own any securities of the Company or any securities or contract rights (other than broadly based index funds) the terms or value of which are dependent on securities of the Company. For a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, you will not, directly or indirectly, and you will cause any person or entity controlled by you not to, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any securities or contract rights (other than broadly based index funds) the terms or value of which are dependent on securities of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, partnership, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its affiliates, (iii) make, or in any way participate in any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934 Act) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (v) negotiate, have any discussions or enter into any arrangements, understandings or agreements (whether written or oral) with, or advise, finance, assist or encourage, any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing, or, make any investment in any other person that engages, or offers or proposes to engage, in any of the foregoing (it being understood that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall not be permitted to act as a joint bidder or co-bidder with any other person with respect to the Company), (vi) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vii) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (viii) advise, assist or encourage any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing. Unless and until you have received the prior written invitation or approval of the Company to do so, you also agree during such period not to (x) request the Company (or Company Representatives), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence), (y) take any action which might require the Company or any of its affiliates to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement or the possibility of a merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction, including, without limitation, a Transaction or (z) communicate with the Company’s shareholders regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.
Prohibition on Trading
In addition, you hereby acknowledge that you are aware, and that you will advise your Representatives who receive any Evaluation Material, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer (and options, warrants and rights relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) is likely to purchase or sell such securities. You hereby agree that neither you nor your Representatives will use or communicate the Evaluation Material in violation of these laws.
Return or Destruction of Documents
If you determine that you do not wish to proceed with a Transaction or your evaluation thereof, you will promptly advise the Company and Stone Key in writing of that decision. In that case, or in the event that (i) a Transaction is not consummated by you or (ii) at any time the Company so requests, you will promptly (a) deliver to the Company all of the Evaluation Material, including all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives or
(b) destroy all Evaluation Material in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives (such destruction to be certified by you in writing to the Company). Notwithstanding the delivery or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you agree that you and your Representatives shall continue to be bound by your obligations under this Agreement.
No Unauthorized Contact
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company, all (i) communications regarding any possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information or Evaluation Material, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to Stone Key. You further agree not to contact any officers, directors or employees of the Company in connection with a possible Transaction without the prior written consent of the Company.
No Obligation, Representation or Warranty
This Agreement does not constitute or create any obligation of the Company or its Representatives to provide any Evaluation Material or other information to you, but defines the duties and obligations of you and your Representatives with respect to the Evaluation Material to the extent it may be disclosed or made available. Under no circumstances will the Company or any of its Representatives be obligated to disclose or make available any information, including, without limitation, any Evaluation Material, which the Company in its sole and absolute discretion determines not to disclose. You understand and acknowledge that none of the Company, Stone Key nor any of their respective Representatives is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you by or on behalf of the Company. None of the Company. Stone Key nor any of their respective Representatives shall have any liability to you or any other person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) resulting from your use of the Evaluation Material, other than as may be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.
You agree that the Company will not be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Transaction by virtue of
(x) this Agreement or (y) any written or oral expression or communication with respect to any Transaction by any of the Company’s Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. You further acknowledge and agree that (i) the Company shall be free to conduct the process for a Transaction as the Company in its sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other person and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to you or any other person); (ii) any of the procedures relating to a Transaction may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person; (iii) the Company shall have the right to reject or accept any potential proposal, offer or participant therein, for any or no reason whatsoever, in its sole discretion; and (iv) neither you nor any of your Representatives currently have any claim whatsoever against the Company, Stone Key or any of their respective Representatives arising out of or relating to a Transaction based on this Agreement or otherwise.
Acting as Principal
You represent and warrant that you are acting as a principal in any possible Transaction and are not represented by any broker or similar party.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This agreement entered into as of December 5, 2013 sets out the terms under which Tennenbaum Capital, in its capacity of representative to the Corporation (as defined below), has agreed to provide information to Novacap Technologies III, L.P. (“Recipient”) about Dialogic Inc. and its affiliates (the “Corporation”) for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction with the Corporation on a mutually agreeable basis (the “Purpose”).
1. Confidential Information: “Confidential Information” means all information which is non-public, confidential or proprietary in nature, whether transferred in writing, orally, visually, electronically or by other means, disclosed by the Corporation or its representatives to the Recipient on or after the date hereof and for the Purpose. Confidential Information includes any reports, analyses or notes that are based on, reflect or contain Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure, in violation of this agreement, by the Recipient or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, members of its advisory committee, lawyers, accountants, auditors or representatives who have been informed of the Confidential Information by the Recipient (collectively, “Representatives”), (ii) was available to or known to the Recipient or its Representatives prior to disclosure by the Corporation or its representatives, (iii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives from a source other than the Corporation or its representatives; provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be prohibited from disclosing such information to the Recipient or its Representatives by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, or (iv) has otherwise been independently acquired or developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without violating any obligations under this agreement.
2. Non-disclosure of Confidential Information: During the period commencing on the date of this agreement and ending on the date of termination in section 9, the Recipient will take all commercially reasonable measures to ensure the continued confidentiality of the Confidential Information and shall not disclose it to anyone except (i) to the Recipient’s Representatives under the limited terms and conditions set forth in section 3, or (ii) as permitted under section 4. Recipient further agrees not to disclose the contemplated transaction, the existence of discussions between the parties regarding the contemplated transaction or the nature or substance of those discussions to any person or entity other than the Corporation or its representatives. The Recipient shall be liable for any breaches by the Recipient’s Representatives of the provisions of this agreement dealing with restrictions on disclosure and use of the Confidential Information.
3. Use of Confidential Information: The Recipient shall use Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and for no other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation understands that Recipient’s business consists of acquiring or investing in businesses in various industries. Accordingly, nothing contained herein shall prevent or be interpreted as preventing Recipient from acquiring or investing in any business or entity that carries or that has carried activities competing with or related to those of any of the Corporation or its affiliates and any such acquisition or investment shall not, in itself, constitute a breach of the provisions of this agreement insofar as the Confidential Information is treated in accordance with the terms provided herein. The Recipient shall permit its Representatives access to the Confidential Information only to the extent necessary to allow them to assist the Recipient in the Purpose. The Recipient further agrees that prior to granting such Representatives access to the Confidential Information, the Recipient shall inform such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and of the terms of this agreement and require such Representatives to agree to abide by all the terms included herein.
4. Required Disclosure: If the Recipient or any of its Representatives is requested to disclose any Confidential Information in connection with any legal or administrative proceeding or investigation, or is required by law, regulation, stock exchange or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, such person or entity will (i) promptly notify the Corporation of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request or requirement (unless prohibited by law, regulation or order of a court or administrative tribunal) so that the Corporation may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or waive compliance with the provisions of this agreement, and (ii) if, in the absence of a protective order, such disclosure is required in the opinion of such person’s or entity’s counsel, such person or entity may make such disclosure without liability under this agreement, provided that such person or entity only furnishes that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required, such person or entity gives the Corporation notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as practicable (unless prohibited by law, regulation or order of a court or administrative tribunal) and, upon Corporation’s request and at Corporation’s expense, such person or entity shall cooperate in any efforts by the Corporation to ensure that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such disclosed information.
5. Completeness of Confidential Information: The Recipient understands and agrees that none of the Corporation or its representatives makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and the Recipient agrees that the Corporation and its representatives shall have no liability to the Recipient or any of its Representatives resulting from or relating to any use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those particular representations and warranties which may be made by the Corporation in a definitive agreement, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such definitive agreement, shall have any legal effect.
6. Return of Confidential Information: As soon as practicable after receipt of a written notice from the Corporation to the Recipient, the Recipient shall (i) at its election, either destroy or return to the Corporation all Confidential Information furnished by the Corporation which is in tangible or electronic form, including any copies which the Recipient or its Representatives have made, and (ii) certify to the Corporation, in writing, that the Recipient has done the foregoing. Any Confidential Information that is not returned or destroyed, including, without limitation, any oral Confidential Information, will remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may retain (i) one copy of the Confidential Information solely for evidentiary purposes in the event of any dispute or proceeding based on or arising from this agreement and (ii) copies of any computer records and files containing any Confidential Information that have been created pursuant to the Recipient’s automatic electronic archiving and back-up procedures until such computer records and files have been deleted in the ordinary course. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation to return or to destroy the Confidential Information does not apply to any notes or information which has been incorporated into the books and records of any board of directors, advisory committee or similar governing body of the Recipient.
7. Potential Transaction: The parties acknowledge and agree that unless and until a written definitive agreement concerning a transaction arising out of the Purpose (a “Transaction”) has been duly executed, neither party nor any of its respective Representatives will have any obligation with respect to any Transaction, with respect to the procedures employed in connection therewith, or with respect to any representations, warranties or covenants made by either party, whether by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to a Transaction (except as specifically provided in this agreement).
8. No Further Rights in Confidential Information: Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any right, title or interest in, or any license or right to use, the Confidential Information, by implication or otherwise other than for the Purpose. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Corporation reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by Recipient or its Representatives with regard to the purchase of any interest, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.
9. Termination: The covenants contained in this agreement shall terminate and expire on the date that is the first anniversary of the date first set out above on this agreement.
10. Remedies: The Recipient understands and agrees that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives and that, in addition to all other remedies, the Corporation shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach.
11. No Waiver: The parties agree that no failure or delay by the other party, its agents, or representatives in exercising any right, power or privilege under this agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege under this agreement.
12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction: This agreement will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Province of Québec and the laws of Canada applicable to agreements made in or to be performed within such province. Each of the parties hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts in the Province of Québec.
13. Severability: If any provision of this agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such determination shall not impair or affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof, and each provision is hereby declared to be separate, severable and distinct.
14. Interpretation: The use of sections and the insertion of headings are for reference purposes only and are not to affect the interpretation of this agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, any reference herein to a particular section refers to the specified section to this agreement. In this agreement, words importing the singular number will include the plural and vice versa, words importing gender will include all genders and words importing persons will include individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, trust, unincorporated organizations, governmental bodies and other legal or business entities.
15. Assignment: Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. This agreement shall enure to the benefit of and shall be binding on and enforceable by the parties and their respective successors, personal representatives and permitted assigns.
16. English Language Contract: Each party agrees that the English language will be the language of this agreement. Il est de la volonté expresse des parties que le présent contrat soit rédigé en anglais.
17. Counterparts: This agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by facsimile or scanned computer image file (such as PDF), each of which shall be deemed to be an original, notwithstanding that all of the parties are not signatory to the same counterpart, facsimile or scanned computer image.

As a condition to such information being furnished to each party, its affiliates, its subsidiaries and other individuals and entities controlled, directly or indirectly, by such party (“Affiliates”), and the respective directors, employees, consultants, accountants, attorneys and advisors of such party and its Affiliates with which such party has entered into confidentiality agreements with material terms that are substantially similar to those in this Agreement (collectively with such Affiliates, “Associates”), each party agrees such information shall be provided to Associates for the limited purpose of evaluating, negotiating or consummating the Transaction, to treat the other party’s Confidential Information in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions, as described in this Agreement. The foregoing definition of Associates who may be furnished confidential information hereby specifically excludes third parties who provide stockholder representation services. A party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder is referred to herein as “the disclosing party” and a party receiving the Confidential Information of a disclosing party hereunder is referred to herein as “the receiving party.”
1. Definition of Confidential Information; Use and Disclosure.
“Confidential Information” means any information, technical data or know-how, including, but not limited to, that which relates to research, product or service plans, business practices, agreement terms, products, services, employees, suppliers, customers, technology or other strategic partners, stockholders, markets, software, know-how, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances, notes, analyses or studies and all tangible and intangible embodiments thereof of any kind whatsoever, whether conveyed in writing or orally by the disclosing party or its Associates to the receiving party or its Associates in connection with the evaluation of a Transaction. The term “Confidential Information” shall be deemed to include those portions of any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by the receiving party or its Associates which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any information furnished to the receiving party or its Associates pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information, technical data or know-how which: (i) is in the possession of the receiving party or its Associates at the time of disclosure, as shown by files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (ii) prior to or after the time of disclosure becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving party or its Associates; (iii) is obtained by the receiving party or its Associates from a source other than the disclosing party or its Associates, which source would not be reasonably expected by the
receiving party or its Associates to have any obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party with respect to such information; (iv) is approved, in writing, for release by the disclosing party; or (v) the receiving party or its Associates can document was independently developed by the receiving party or its Associates without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.
Each of the parties hereto agree not to use the Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party or its Associates except in connection with preparing a proposal for and any discussions of a Transaction or as otherwise permitted hereunder. Neither party will disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties except those of its Associates who are required to have the information in order to evaluate and discuss a Transaction. The receiving party shall inform its Associates of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall instruct them to treat the information confidentially. The receiving party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Associates and agrees, at its sole expense, to take all commercially reasonable measures to restrain its Associates from disclosure or use of the Confidential Information in breach of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will take commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of, and to avoid having Confidential Information of the other party enter the public domain, become publicly available, or be held by persons not authorized hereunder to have such Confidential Information, which measures shall include at least the same degree of care that the receiving party utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. Each party agrees to notify the other party in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of such Confidential Information of the other party that may come to its attention.
2. Nonpublicity. The existence and the terms of this Agreement, any Transaction, the fact that any Confidential Information has been provided to the other party, and the existence, nature and status of any discussions between the parties shall be treated as Confidential Information hereunder, shall be maintained in strict confidence by the parties hereto and by their respective Associates and, subject to Section 3 of this Agreement, shall not be disclosed to any third party.
3. Required Disclosure. In the event that a receiving party or its Associates is or becomes legally compelled under applicable law, regulation or securities exchange listing agreement, or by a competent governmental, administrative or regulatory authority or in a proceeding before a court, arbitrator or administrative agency, whether or not as a result of a Transaction to which the Company has consented, to disclose any portion of the Confidential Information of a disclosing party, that discussions or negotiations between the parties hereto are taking place or have taken place, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to a Transaction, including the status thereof, the receiving party will, and will direct its Associates to, provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice (unless prohibited by law) of such legal compulsion, and shall delay disclosure, if and to the extent permitted or practicable, until the disclaiming party has had an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or to waive compliance by the receiving party and/or its Associates with the relevant provisions of this Agreement. In the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained in such a proceeding, or the disclosing party fails to waive compliance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the receiving party agrees that it will, and will direct its Associates to, disclose only that Confidential Information of the disclosing party which its counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed and will exercise commercially reasonable efforts, and will direct its Associates to exercise their commercially reasonable efforts, at the request and expense of the disclosing party, to cooperate with the disclosing party in its efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information which is so disclosed.
4. No License Granted. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right, nor shall this Agreement grant either party any rights in or to the other party’s Confidential Information, except the limited right to review such Confidential Information solely for the purposes of determining whether to enter into, and the undertaking of or the advising with respect to, a Transaction.

The parties further agree that each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Associates with regard to a Transaction and to terminate discussions or negotiations at any time.
7. Similar Products. Each disclosing party acknowledges that the receiving party or its Associates may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties, that is similar to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the receiving party or its Associates from developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, servicing or supporting or having developed, manufactured, marketed, sold, serviced or supported for it products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, provided that the receiving party and its Associates do not use any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in connection with such activities. Neither party nor its respective Associates shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its respective employees or consultants as a result of their having had access to Confidential Information of the other party or its Associates.
8. Residuals. The receiving party’s employees may use any Residuals for any purpose, provided that this paragraph does not grant or imply any license or other right to use any patent, trademark, copyright, mask work right or other intellectual property right. “Residuals” means information that is retained, as general knowledge and experience, in the
unaided memory of the receiving party’s employees who have had access to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information within the scope of the receiving party’s obligations under this Agreement, but who no longer have access to such Confidential Information. However, Residuals does not include any detailed financial or personnel data. The ability to use Residuals shall be narrowly construed, is intended only to alleviate the possibility of inadvertent breach of this Agreement as a result of routine, unaided memory retention, and does not allow the receiving party to use or disclose information known to the receiving party to be Confidential Information that is subject to this Agreement. The memory of an employee of the receiving party is unaided if such employee has not intentionally memorized the Confidential Information or retained notes or other aids to such memory,
9. Commercial Relationship Use. Notwithstanding any obligations or restrictions to the contrary contained herein, if during due diligence review, HPE learns of flaws or problems with Company’s products, software, services or intellectual property rights, the Associates of HPE evaluating the potential Transaction may share such information with the Associates of HPE who are responsible for purchasing such products, software or services or licensing such intellectual property on behalf of HPE (“Purchasing Associates”). For avoidance of doubt, Purchasing Associates of the receiving party that receive such information agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. In the event any Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to this Section 9, HPE shall notify the Company of any information shared with Associates of HPE within fifteen (15) business days after such disclosure.
10. Termination of Discussions. Following written notice by one party to another of the termination of discussions between the parties, upon written request of the disclosing party, the receiving party shall take reasonable steps to instruct all persons involved in the Transaction to destroy all Confidential Information furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the disclosing party pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party and its Associates may retain any Confidential Information to the extent required pursuant to the regulatory compliance or record retention policies of such receiving party or Associate.
11. Term. The foregoing commitments of either party in this Agreement regarding the confidentiality and non-use of Confidential Information shall survive any termination of discussions between the parties and shall continue for a period of eighteen
(18) months following the date of this Agreement.
12. Attorney-Client Privilege. To the extent that any Confidential Information of the disclosing party may include materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine and other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine,
