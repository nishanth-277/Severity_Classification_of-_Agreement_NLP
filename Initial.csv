"""text"": ""Exhibit (d)(3)\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is being entered into as of March 19, 2018 between ARMO Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cSeller\u201d), and Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation (\u201cBuyer\u201d and with Seller referred to collectively as the \u201cParties\u201d and individually as a \u201cParty\u201d).\nIn order to facilitate the consideration and negotiation of a possible negotiated transaction involving Buyer\u2019s acquisition of all of the equity interests in Seller (a \u201cTransaction\u201d), each Party has either requested or may request access to certain non-public information regarding the other Party and the other Party\u2019s subsidiaries. (Each Party, in its capacity as a provider of information, is referred to in this Agreement as the \u201cProvider\u201d; and each Party, in its capacity as a recipient of information, is referred to in this Agreement as the \u201cRecipient\u201d.) This Agreement sets forth the Parties\u2019 obligations regarding the use and disclosure of such information and regarding various related matters.\nThe Parties, intending to be legally bound, acknowledge and agree as follows:\n1. Limitations on Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. Neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives (as defined in Section 13 below) will, at any time, directly or indirectly:\n(a) make use of any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information (as defined in Section 12 below), except for the specific purpose of considering, evaluating and negotiating a Transaction between the Parties; or\n(b) subject to Section 4 below, disclose any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information to any other Person (as defined in Section 13 below).\nThe Recipient will be liable and responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives and for any other action or conduct on the part of any of its Representatives that is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement. The Recipient will (at its own expense) take all reasonable actions necessary to restrain its Representatives from making any unauthorized use or disclosure of any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information.\n2. Provider Contact Person. Any request by the Recipient or any of its Representatives to review any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information must be directed to the individual(s) identified opposite the name of the Provider on EXHIBIT A (the \u201cProvider Contact Person\u201d). Neither the Recipient nor any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives will contact or otherwise communicate with any other Representative of the Provider in connection with a Transaction without the prior written authorization of the Provider Contact Person.\n3. No Representations by Provider. Neither the Provider nor any of the Provider\u2019s Representatives will be under any obligation to make any particular Confidential Information of the Provider available to the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives or to supplement or update any Confidential Information of the Provider previously furnished.\nNeither the Provider nor any of its Representatives has made or is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information, and neither the Provider nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Recipient or to any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives on any basis (including, without limitation, in contract, tort or under United States federal or state securities laws or otherwise) relating to or resulting from the use of any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information or any inaccuracies or errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations and warranties that are included in any final definitive written agreement that provides for the consummation of a Transaction between the Parties (a \u201cDefinitive Agreement\u201d) will have legal effect.\n4. Permitted Disclosures.\n(a) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 1 above:\n(i) the Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Provider if and to the extent that the Provider consents in writing to the Recipient\u2019s disclosure thereof;\n(ii) subject to Section 4(b) below, the Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Provider to any Representative of the Recipient, but only to the extent such Representative (A) needs to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of helping the Recipient evaluate or negotiate a Transaction between the Parties, and (B) has been provided with a copy of this Agreement and has agreed to abide and be bound by the provisions hereof or is otherwise bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement; and\n(iii) subject to Section 4(c) below, the Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Provider to the extent required by applicable law or governmental regulation or by valid legal process or stock exchange rule.\n(b) If the Provider delivers to the Recipient a written notice stating that certain Confidential Information of the Provider may be disclosed only to specified Representatives of the Recipient (such notice, a \u201cPermitted Representatives Notice\u201d), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4(a)(ii) above, the Recipient shall not thereafter disclose or permit the disclosure of any of such Confidential Information to any other Representative of the Recipient (any such other Representative, an \u201cImpermissible Representative\u201d). For clarity, if the Recipient disclosed, or permitted the disclosure of, any such certain Confidential Information to an Impermissible Representative prior to the Recipient\u2019s receipt of the Permitted Representatives Notice, such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.\n(c) If the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives is required by law or governmental regulation or by subpoena or other valid legal process to disclose any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information to any Person, then the Recipient will promptly provide the Provider with written notice of the applicable law, regulation or process so that the Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The Recipient and its Representatives will cooperate with the Provider and the Provider\u2019s Representatives (at the Provider\u2019s sole expense) in any attempt by the Provider to obtain any such protective order or other remedy. If the Provider elects not to seek, or is unsuccessful in obtaining, any such protective order or other remedy in connection with any requirement that the Recipient disclose Confidential Information of the Provider, then the Recipient may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent legally required; provided however, that the Recipient and its Representatives will use their reasonable efforts to ensure that such Confidential Information is treated confidentially by each Person to whom it is disclosed.\n5. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the Provider\u2019s request, the Recipient and the Recipient\u2019s Representatives will promptly deliver to the Provider any of the Provider\u2019s Confidential Information (and all copies thereof) obtained or possessed by the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives; provided, however, that, in lieu of delivering such Confidential Information to the Provider, the Recipient may destroy such Confidential Information and deliver to the Provider a certificate confirming their destruction; provided further, that Recipient shall not be required to return or destroy copies of Confidential Information created pursuant to Recipient\u2019s automatic archiving and back-up procedures. Notwithstanding the delivery to the Provider, the destruction by the Recipient or the automatic archiving by Recipient of Confidential Information of the Provider pursuant to this Section 5, the Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by their confidentiality obligations and other obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Confidential Information.\n6. Limitation on Soliciting Employees. During the 12 month period commencing on the date of this Agreement, each Party agrees that neither it nor any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries who is or becomes aware of the negotiation of a possible Transaction between the Parties shall solicit for employment any employee of the other Party (or any of such other Party\u2019s direct or indirect subsidiaries) with whom it (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries) came into contact in connection with a possible Transaction; provided, however, that this Section 6 will not prevent either Party or its direct or indirect subsidiaries from making generalized searches for employees by causing to be placed any general advertisement or similar notices or engaging search firms, provided that that such searches are not targeted specifically at employees of the other Party or its direct or indirect subsidiaries.\n7. Standstill Provision. During the 12 month period commencing on the date of this Agreement (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), neither Buyer nor any of Buyer\u2019s subsidiaries or other Representatives on behalf of Buyer will, in any manner, directly or indirectly:\n(a) make, effect, initiate, cause or participate in (i) any acquisition of beneficial ownership of any securities of Seller or any securities of any subsidiary of Seller, (ii) any acquisition of any assets of Seller or any assets of any subsidiary of Seller, (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or extraordinary transaction involving Seller or any subsidiary of Seller or involving any securities or assets of Seller or any securities 4r assets of any subsidiary of Seller, or (iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents with respect to any securities of Seller or any subsidiary of Seller;\n(b) form, join or participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder) with respect to the beneficial ownership of any securities of Seller or any subsidiary of Seller;\n(c) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of Seller or any subsidiary of Seller;\n(d) take any action that might require Seller to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause (a) of this Section 7;\n(e) agree or offer to take, or encourage or propose (publicly or otherwise) the taking of, any action referred to in clause (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this Section 7;\n(f) assist, induce or encourage any other Person to take any action of the type referred to in clause (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this Section 7;\n(g) enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangement or agreement with any other Person relating to any of the foregoing; or\n(h) request or propose that Seller or any of Seller\u2019s Representatives amend, waive or consider the amendment or waiver of any provision set forth in this Section 7;\nprovided that Buyer shall not be prohibited from making or discussing any offers in a confidential, non-public manner that does not violate sub-clause (d) above regarding the Transaction directly to or with the management or the Board of Directors of Seller, or their designated Representatives (provided that the contents, subject and existence of any such communications shall constitute Confidential Information hereunder).\nThe standstill provisions of this Section 7 shall not apply to the Parties\u2019 entry into or consummation of the transactions contemplated by a Definitive Agreement. The standstill provisions of this Section 7 shall not apply in the event that, without any violation of the standstill provision, (1) any third party unrelated to Buyer has made any public announcement of its intent to commence a tender offer or exchange offer for more than 50% of the capital stock of Seller, (ii) Seller publicly announces that it has entered into a definitive agreement for a transaction or series of transactions (whether structured as a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, sale of assets or other similar transaction) that, if consummated, would result in a sale of more than 50% of the capital stock of Seller or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Seller, or (iii) any third party unrelated to Buyer commences, or makes a public announcement of its intention to commence, a proxy contest or proxy solicitation with respect to the election of, or enters into an agreement, commitment or understanding with respect to the replacement or addition of, members of the Board of Directors of the Seller such that a majority of the Board of Directors of Seller would be designated by such third party. The standstill provisions of this Section 7 shall automatically become applicable again if the third party announces its intent not to proceed with the proposed transaction described in Section 7(a) above; provided, however, that the Standstill Period shall not be extended beyond its original term. The expiration of the Standstill Period will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this letter agreement.\n8. No Obligation to Pursue Transaction. Unless the Parties enter into a Definitive Agreement, no agreement providing for a transaction involving either of the Parties will be deemed to exist between the Parties, and neither Party will be under any obligation to negotiate or enter into any such agreement or transaction with the other Party. Each Party recognizes that, except as expressly provided in any legally binding written agreement between the Parties that is executed on or after the date of this Agreement: (i) the other Party and its Representatives will be free to negotiate with, and to enter into any agreement or transaction with, any other interested party; and (ii) such Party will not have any rights or claims against the other Party or any of the other Party\u2019s Representatives arising out of or relating to any transaction or proposed transaction involving the other Party.\n9. No Waiver. No failure or delay by either Party or any of its Representatives in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege under this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended except by means of a written instrument that is validly executed on behalf of both of the Parties and that refers specifically to the particular provision or provisions being waived or amended.\n10. Remedies. Each Party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such Party or by any of such Party\u2019s Representatives and that the other Party would suffer irreparable harm as a result of any such breach. Accordingly, each Party will also be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the other Party or any of the other Party\u2019s Representatives (without the need for posting a bond or providing other security). The equitable remedies referred to above will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but rather will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Parties.\n11. Successors and Assigns; Applicable Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Party and its Representatives and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws). Each Party: (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware; and (c) irrevocably and unconditionally waives the right to plead or claim, and irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to plead or claim, that any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is brought in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n12.

Neither the Recipient nor the Recipient\u2019s Representatives shall file any patent application containing any claim to any subject matter derived from the Confidential Information of the Provider.\n(e) To the extent that any Confidential Information includes materials or other information that may be subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege or doctrine concerning any Confidential Information or any pending, threatened or prospective action, suit, proceeding, investigation, arbitration or dispute, (i) Provider, or the applicable direct or indirect subsidiary of Provider, is not waiving and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished its attorney-client privileges, work-product protections, or other applicable privileges or doctrines as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened litigation) and (ii) it is acknowledged and agreed that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such Confidential Information or action, suit, proceeding, investigation, arbitration or dispute and that it is the Parties\u2019 mutual desire, intention and understanding that the sharing of such materials and other information is not intended to, and shall not, affect the confidentiality of any of such materials or other information or waive or diminish the continued protection of any of such materials or other information under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege or doctrine.

The Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set forth herein are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Alliqua Entities acquired pursuant to the Contribution and Merger Agreement. In addition, the Restricted Party acknowledges that the consideration paid pursuant to the terms of the Contribution and Merger Agreement is paid in part as consideration for customer and client contacts, marketplace reputation and goodwill developed by the Restricted Party for the Company and the covenants set forth herein are necessary for the Alliqua Entities to receive the full benefit of the Contribution and Merger Agreement.\n(c) The Restricted Party hereby acknowledges the broad territorial scope of the covenants contained in this Agreement, but acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions are reasonable and enforceable in view of, among other things, (i) the narrow range of activities prohibited, (ii) the Company\u2019s products and services are marketed on a wide geographic scope, (iii) the Confidential Information of the Company to which the Restricted Party had, has or will have access, (iv) the fact that a business that competes with Alliqua Entities could greatly benefit if it were to obtain the Confidential Information of the Company, (v) the Alliqua Entities acquisition of the Company Intellectual Property and goodwill of the Company pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Contribution and Merger Agreement, (vi) the fact that the Restricted Party would have an unfair competitive advantage if the Restricted Party were allowed to engage in the competitive activities prohibited by this Agreement in light of the Confidential Information and/or goodwill that the Restricted Party has acquired, and (vii) the provisions of this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the Alliqua Entities\u2019 interests in and right to use and operate the Company\u2019s business from and after Closing.\n4. Non-Disclosure. The Restricted Party agrees not to dispute, contest, or deny any ownership rights of the Alliqua Entities of the Confidential Information or the Company Intellectual Property. The Restricted Party agrees to preserve and protect the confidentiality of all Confidential Information. The Restricted Party shall not directly or indirectly, disclose to any unauthorized person or use for the Restricted Party\u2019s own account any Confidential Information. The Restricted Party shall hold all Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and take all commercially reasonable precautions to prevent its inadvertent disclosure to any unauthorized person. The Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, other than on behalf of the Alliqua Entities, utilize, disclose or make available to any other person or entity, any of the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the covenants in this Section 4 shall not apply to Confidential Information that the Restricted Party is required to disclose by applicable Law, after providing written notice to the Alliqua Entities before producing the information, which notice shall be given as soon as practicable, so that the Alliqua Entities, at their sole expense, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\n5. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation. In exchange for the consideration contemplated under the Contribution and Merger Agreement and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the Contribution and Merger Agreement:\n(a) During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, own, manage, engage in, operate, control, work for, consult with, render services for, do business with, maintain any interest in (proprietary, financial or otherwise) or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engage in the Restricted Business, other than on behalf of the Alliqua Entities; provided, that the restrictions contained in this Section 5(a) shall not restrict the acquisition by the Restricted Party, directly or indirectly, of less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a Restricted Business.\n(b) During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce, recruit or encourage anyone who is a consultant or employee of the Company or the Alliqua Entities to terminate his or her employment or consulting relationship with the Company or the Alliqua Entities, or without the consent of the Alliqua Entities, hire, retain or engage any such person for the Restricted Party or for another Person or entity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5(b) shall prevent the Restricted Party or any of its Affiliates from hiring, soliciting, inducing, recruiting or encouraging (i) any employee or consultant whose employment or consultancy has been terminated by the Company or the Alliqua Entities; or (ii) twelve (12) months after the date of termination of employment, any employee or consultant whose employment has been terminated by the employee or the consultant.\n(c) During the Restricted Period, the Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit business from, interfere with, attempt to solicit business from, interfere with, or do business with any actual or prospective customer or client with whom the Company or the Alliqua Entities does or has done business (including direct purchasers of the Company\u2019s TheraSkin\u00ae product), in any case for the purpose of discussing or securing business or contracts related to the Restricted Business, or (ii) attempt to influence, encourage, persuade or induce any such actual or prospective customer or client whom the Company or the Alliqua Entities does or has done business to reduce the extent of its business dealings with the Alliqua Entities (including direct purchasers of the Company\u2019s TheraSkin\u00ae product).\n(d) The Restricted Party shall not, and shall cause any Affiliates not to, disparage or initiate negative publicity about the Company, the Alliqua Entities, or any of their respective employees, agents, business, policies, products, or services.\n(e) If the Restricted Party violates any of the restrictions contained in this Article 5, the Restricted Period shall be suspended and shall not run in favor of the Restricted Party from the time of commencement of any violation until the time when the Restricted Party ceases the violation.\n6. Remedies. The Restricted Party acknowledges that the restrictions contained herein, in view of the nature of the Company\u2019s business and the businesses of the Alliqua Entities, are reasonable and necessary to protect their legitimate business interests, business goodwill and reputation, and that any violation of these restrictions would result in irreparable injury and continuing damage to them, and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Therefore, the Restricted Party agrees that the Alliqua Entities shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief restraining the Restricted Party from the commission of any breach or threatened breach of any covenants herein, without the necessity of establishing irreparable harm or the posting of a bond, and to recover from the Restricted Party damages incurred, as well as the attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses related to any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and enforcement of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting the Alliqua Entities from pursuing any other remedies available to them for any breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, the recovery of money damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Restricted Party, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of the restrictive covenants contained herein, or preclude injunctive relief.\n7. Assignment; Binding Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. The Restricted Party may not assign this Agreement to a third party.

Purpose. This Agreement is made in order for each party to disclose to the other, during the term of this Agreement, such scientific, technical, business and financial information as the disclosing party may elect to disclose so that the receiving party may use the same solely for the purpose of evaluating the Confidential Information internally in connection with evaluating a possible transaction between the parties relating to one, more or all of Spark\u2019s gene therapy product candidates and/or assets (the \u201cPurpose\u201d) under terms that will protect the confidential and proprietary nature of such information.\n2. Confidential Information. As used herein, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d will mean any and all scientific, technical, business and financial information, including third party information, that is furnished or disclosed, in whatever form or medium (regardless of whether tangible, intangible, visual, or oral), to the receiving party, before or after the Effective Date. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes but is not limited to: (a) patent and patent applications; (b) manufacturing, including process and know-how; (c) clinical trial design or results; (d) vendors; (e) trade secrets; and (f) other proprietary information, ideas, gene sequences, cell lines, samples, chemical compounds, assays, biological materials, techniques, sketches, drawings, works of authorship, models, inventions, know-how, processes, apparatuses, equipment, and formulae related to the current, future, and proposed products and services of each of the parties, and including without limitation, their respective information concerning research, experimental work, development, design details and specifications, engineering, financial information, procurement requirements, purchasing, manufacturing, customer lists, investors, employees, business and contractual relationships, business forecasts, analyst reports, sales and merchandising, marketing plans and any additional non-public information the disclosing party provides.\n3.

The receiving party agrees to be responsible for any breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement by any of its employees, consultants or representatives. Each receiving party agrees that in the event permission is granted by the disclosing party to copy Confidential Information, each such copy will contain and state the same confidential or proprietary notices or legends, if any, that appear on the original.\n4. Exceptions. The obligations and restrictions imposed by this Agreement will not apply to any Confidential Information that the receiving party can establish by competent evidence acceptable under applicable law and as deemed appropriate by the competent court: (a) is already known to the receiving party prior to the disclosing party\u2019s disclosure; (b) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (c) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party; or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to any Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such information is embraced by more general information in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving party, and (ii) any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving party, but only if the combination itself and its principle of operation are in the public domain or in the possession of the receiving party. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, other than in the case of an External Demand (as defined below), the receiving party may disclose either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Purpose or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to the Purpose, including the status thereof or that Confidential Information has been made available to the receiving party (such information, \u201cTransaction Information\u201d) if but only if (i) such disclosure is required under applicable securities or antitrust laws or under applicable stock exchange rules as determined based on advice of legal counsel and (ii) such disclosure requirement does not arise from a breach of this Agreement. In the event the receiving party receives a request or is required by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or pursuant to a formal request from a regulatory examiner (any such requested or required disclosure, an \u201cExternal Demand\u201d) to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party or the Transaction Information, the receiving party shall (1) immediately notify the disclosing party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such External Demand, (2) consult with the disclosing party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request or disclosure, and (3) assist the disclosing party, at the disclosing party\u2019s expense, in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy to the extent available under the circumstances. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the disclosing party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (x) the receiving party may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information or Transaction Information which the receiving party is advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed and to only those persons to whom the receiving party is advised by counsel are legally required to receive such information, and the receiving party shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information or Transaction Information, and (y) the receiving party shall not be liable for such disclosure, unless such disclosure was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by the receiving party not permitted by this Agreement.\n5. Handling of Information and Materials. Confidential Information will not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the Purpose of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of the disclosing party will remain the property of the disclosing party and will contain and state any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends that appear on the original, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the disclosing party. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, or upon written request of the disclosing party, each receiving party will promptly destroy (to the extent reasonably practicable in case of electronic files) or return to the other all documents and other tangible materials representing the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information and all copies thereof. Notwithstanding the forgoing the receiving party may retain one copy of all Confidential Information in its legal department solely for archival and compliance purposes and its external advisors, if any, may keep one copy of their Confidential Information in accordance with the laws and professional standards applicable to them.\n6. No Other Rights. The parties recognize and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting any property rights, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information of the disclosing party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or to any invention or any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right that has issued or that may issue, based on such Confidential Information. Each receiving party will not make, have made, use or sell for any purpose any product or other item using, incorporating or derived from any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.\n7. Standstill. Company hereby acknowledges that, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Spark, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this Agreement (the \u201cRestricted Period\u201d) none of Company, nor any of its Affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) who are provided with Confidential Information or become aware of Company\u2019s discussions with Spark, will: (a) propose (i) any merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer, purchase of Spark\u2019s assets or businesses, or similar transactions involving Spark or (ii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation or other extraordinary transaction with respect to Spark; (b) (i) acquire beneficial ownership of any voting securities (including in derivative form) of Spark (collectively, a transaction specified in (a)(i), (a)(ii) and (b)(i) involving a majority of Spark\u2019s outstanding voting securities or consolidated assets, is referred to as a \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d), (ii) propose or seek, whether alone or in concert with others, any \u201csolicitation\u201d (as such term is used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) of proxies or consents to vote any securities (including in derivative form) of Spark, (iii) nominate any person as a director of Spark, or (iv) propose any matter to be voted upon by the stockholders of Spark; (c) directly or indirectly, form, join or in any way participate in a third party \u201cgroup\u201d (as such term is used in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) (or discuss with any third party the potential formation of a group) with respect to any voting securities (including in derivative form) of Spark or a Business Combination involving Spark; (d) request Spark (or any of its officers, directors or representatives), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) in a way which would require Spark to publicly disclose the same; or (d) take any action that could require Spark to make a public announcement regarding a potential Business Combination; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit Company from make a confidential proposal to Spark or Spark\u2019s Chairman of the Board of Directors for a transaction involving a Business Combination at any time for a transaction involving a Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph to the contrary, the foregoing restrictions set forth in this paragraph shall immediately and automatically terminate and cease to apply with respect to Company and its Affiliates without any further action in the event that (A) Spark\u2019s board of directors (or a committee thereof) approves, or Spark enters into a definitive agreement providing for, a Business Combination, (B) a third party commences, or announces an intention to commence, a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would constitute a Business Combination and (i) the board of directors (or a committee thereof) of Spark at any time recommends, or publicly discloses an intention to recommend, that Spark\u2019s shareholders tender their shares into such tender or exchange offer (as it may have been amended), or (ii) the board of directors (or a committee thereof) of Spark does not, within ten business days from the date such offer is first published, sent or given to shareholders, recommend that Spark\u2019s shareholders not tender their shares into such tender or exchange offer (as it may have been amended) or at any time thereafter changes its recommendation with respect to such tender or exchange offer (as it may have been amended) or takes any similar action that results in such board of directors no longer recommending that Spark\u2019s shareholders not tender their shares into such tender or exchange offer, (C) any person or \u201cgroup\u201d (as such term is used under the Exchange Act) commences, or announces an intention to commence, any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used under the Exchange Act) or consents with respect to the voting securities of Spark in which such person or group would, if successful, elect or acquire the ability to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors of Spark or result in a majority of the seats of the board of directors of Spark becoming vacant, or (D) with respect to any pending tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Spark, the consummation of which would constitute a Business Combination, Spark\u2019s board of directors (or any committee thereof) no longer recommends that its shareholders tender their shares into such tender or exchange offer (as it may have been amended). The parties further acknowledge that Spark may enter into additional standstill agreements similar to the provision in this paragraph with third parties in connection with such third parties evaluating a possible transaction with Spark (\u201cOther Standstill Agreement\u201d), and the parties hereby agree that, to the extent that any such Other Standstill Agreement contains provisions that are more favorable to the third party than the provisions in this paragraph, this Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended to incorporate such more favorable terms as set forth in the Other Standstill Agreement. Following the expiration of the Restricted Period, no provision of this agreement shall restrict Company or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, from taking any action described in this paragraph 7 (including using for the purpose of such action, but not otherwise disclosing any Confidential Information). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph 7 shall prevent the Company from entering into license, collaboration or other similar agreements in the ordinary course of business.\n8. Passive Investments. The provisions of paragraph 7 shall not prohibit, Company or its Affiliates from owning and/or acquiring voting shares or other ownership interests in Spark provided that Company together with its Affiliates owns, in the aggregate, not more 5% of such voting securities. The provisions of paragraph 7 shall not prohibit passive investments by a pension or employee benefit plan or trust for Company\u2019s or its Affiliates employees so long as such investments are directed by independent trustees, administrators or employees to whom no Confidential Information has been disclosed.\n9. Term and Termination. This Agreement will terminate one (1) year after the Effective Date, or may be terminated by either party at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. The receiving party\u2019s obligations under this Agreement will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years after the termination or expiration hereof and will be binding upon the receiving party\u2019s heirs, successors and assigns after such termination or expiration; provided that the rights and obligations in Section 7 shall expire as set forth therein.\n10. Notice. Any notice to be given hereunder by either party to the other will be in writing addressed to the address set forth in the opening paragraph above (unless either provides written notice of a different address) and will be deemed given: (a) upon delivery if sent by overnight courier; or (b) three (3) days after deposit in the mail if sent by pre-paid, certified mail, return receipt requested mail.\n11. General. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. The headings to sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and will not be deemed a part hereof or affect the construction or interpretation of any provision hereof. No provision of this Agreement will be deemed waived, amended or modified by either party, unless such waiver, amendment or modification is made in writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws principles. Any dispute under this Agreement may be brought in the state courts and the Federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and the parties hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Each party acknowledges and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach (or threatened breach) of this Agreement by the receiving party or its Affiliates or representatives and that the disclosing party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach (or threatened breach), without proof of damages, and each party further agrees to waive, and use its best efforts to cause its Affiliates and representatives to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Such remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions. Neither party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, provided that a party may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate or successor without the consent of the other party in connection with a merger, reorganization, consolidation, change of control, sale of substantially all assets or similar transaction of the assigning party. Neither party will export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing any such data to any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval. This Agreement may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. Signatures delivered by facsimile, PDF or electronic mail shall be as effective as original signatures.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, duly authorized representatives of the parties have executed this Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the Effective Date.\nSPARK THERAPEUTICS, INC.

General. In connection with the consideration of a possible transaction involving RHI and JDA (a \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d), the Party referred to as the \u201cProvider\u201d is prepared to make available to the Party referred to as the \u201cRecipient\u201d certain \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d (as defined in Section 2 below) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth.\n2. Definitions.\n(a) The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means information concerning the Provider which is furnished on or after November 8, 2011 to the Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below) on the Recipient's behalf in connection with the Recipient\u2019s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives to the extent containing or which are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by the Provider hereunder, The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within the Recipient\u2019s or its Representatives possession prior to its being furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Provider, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Provider with respect to such information, or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives.\n(b) The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d in the case of JDA shall mean the directors, officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, financial advisors, agents, consultants, advisors, accountants or auditors of JDA. The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d in the case of RHI shall mean the directors, officers, employees, counsel, and with prior written consent of JDA (not to be unreasonably withheld), investment bankers, financial advisors, potential sources of capital or financing (debt or equity), agents, consultants, advisors, accountants or auditors of RHI.

Use of Evaluation Material. The Recipient and its Representatives will use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and, subject to Section 5, will not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to the Recipient\u2019s Representatives for the purpose of helping the Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction. The Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives, other than those of Recipient\u2019s unaffiliated Representatives who have entered into a separate confidentiality agreement with the Provider. This Agreement does not grant the Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use the Provider\u2019s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, RHI agrees that it shall not disclose any of the Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of JDA to any of its affiliates that are not included in the definition of RHI.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such Party and its Representatives will not disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been exchanged between the Parties, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); provided, however, that JDA may make such disclosure if it does not identify RHI by name or by identifiable description. RHI agrees that neither RHI nor any Representative (to the extent acting on behalf or at the direction of RHI) of RHI will, without the prior consent of JDA (not to be unreasonably withheld), directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any other person regarding a Possible Transaction (including, without limitation, financing thereof). RHI represents and warrants that, except as disclosed to JDA or its outside counsel prior to the date hereof, neither RHI nor any Representative of RHI have, prior to the date hereof, taken any of the actions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. Without limiting the foregoing, RHI agrees that neither RHI nor any Representative (to the extent acting on behalf and at the direction of RHI) of RHI will, without the prior written consent of JDA, enter into any exclusive arrangement with respect to the provision of debt financing in connection with a Possible Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, any agreement, arrangement or other understanding, whether written or oral, with any potential debt financing source which does, or could be reasonably expected to, legally or contractually limit, restrict or otherwise impair in any manner, directly or indirectly, such financing source from acting as a potential debt financing source to any other party with respect to a Potential Transaction shall be deemed an exclusive arrangement.\n5. Legally Required Disclosure. If the Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, the Recipient or such Representative shall provide the Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Provider, the Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled or required by law to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4, the Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which the Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled or required by law to disclose; provided that the Recipient and/or its Representatives exercise its commercially reasonable efforts, at the Provider\u2019s sole expense, to preserve the confidentiality of such Evaluation Material or any of such facts, including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with the Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient and its Representatives may disclose such information, and need not provide such notice, in connection with a routine blanket audit or proceeding (including in response to oral questions or requests for information or documents) involving the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, by a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the Recipient or such Representative where neither the Provider nor the Possible Transaction is the target of such proceeding or audit. In either case, the Recipient and its Representatives shall take reasonable measures to obtain confidential treatment with respect to any such information disclosed.\n6. No Contacts.

No Solicitation. The Recipient will not, within one year from the date of this Agreement, solicit the employment or consulting services of any of the officers of the Provider with whom it has had contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction, so long as they are employed by the Provider.

In no event shall this Section 10 be construed as prohibiting the taking of any of the aforementioned actions with respect to any Person other than JDA or any of its subsidiaries notwithstanding the fact that, at the time such action is taken, JDA (or a subsidiary thereof) may be a subsidiary of such Person.\n11. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by a Party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n12. Compliance with Securities Laws. The Recipient and its Representatives agree not to use any Evaluation Material of the Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.\n13. Not a Transaction Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until both Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Each Party also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.\n14. No Representations or Warranties: No Obligation to Disclose. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of the Provider and shall have no liability to the Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to the Recipient, the Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating a Party to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.\n15. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n16. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof without the requirement of posting a bond or other security. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed. If a court of competent jurisdiction, pursuant to a final, non-appealable order, determines that the Recipient or any of its Representatives has breached this Agreement, the Recipient shall pay the reasonable costs (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Provider in enforcing this Agreement.\n17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and its successors (including any purchaser of such Party) and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement may be enforced by any Person with which the Recipient enters into a transaction. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware, New Castle County, for the purpose of any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in any such court, and further agree that service of process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its address set forth in this Agreement will be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.\n19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n20.

(including, where the context requires, its subsidiaries and affiliates, \u201cRecipient\u201d). In consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained herein, to induce the Company to provide certain information to Recipient and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement do hereby agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information. For all purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall collectively refer to all information or material disclosed or provided by the Company to Recipient, either orally or in writing, or obtained by Recipient from a third party or any other source, regardless of the manner in which it is furnished, concerning any aspect of the business or affairs of the Company or its \u201caffiliates\u201d (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)). Confidential Information also includes any notes, analyses, compilations, data, forecasts, reports, summaries, studies or other material or documents prepared by Recipient which contain, reflect or are based, in whole or in part, on the Confidential Information.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information or material that (i) is publicly available or becomes publicly available through no action or fault of Recipient, (ii) was already in Recipient\u2019s possession or known to Recipient prior to being disclosed or provided to Recipient by or on behalf of the Company, provided, that, the source of such information or material was not bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company or any other party with respect thereto, (iii) was or is obtained by Recipient from a third party, provided, that, such third party was not bound by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company or any other party with respect to such information or material, or (iv) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of or reference to the Confidential Information.\n2.

Recipient shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that the Confidential Information remains strictly confidential and is not disclosed to or seen, used or obtained by any person or entity except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Recipient agrees not to contact any shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, customers, or suppliers of the Company or its affiliates with respect to the Transaction or for the purpose of obtaining information for use in evaluating the Transaction, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent.

The Recipient shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to obtain such a protective order or other remedy. If such order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Recipient and its Representatives shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which they are advised by counsel that they are legally required to so disclose and shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at the Disclosing Party\u2019s expense) to obtain reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Evaluation Material so disclosed.\nSection 8. Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material. As promptly as practicable following the written request of the Disclosing Party (but in any event within seven (7) calendar days), the Recipient shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, destroy all Evaluation Material in tangible form (whether in written form, electronically stored or otherwise) furnished to Recipient and in Recipient\u2019s possession or in the possession of any of its Representatives, and neither the Recipient nor any of its Representatives shall retain any copies thereof, except to the extent required to comply with applicable Law or bona fide internal record retention policies or procedures for legal, compliance or regulatory purposes; provided, that nothing contained herein shall require any Person to destroy Evaluation Material in electronic form (including any computer systems, back-up and archive tapes or other electronic backup systems) to the extent that such destruction is not commercially practicable and any retained Evaluation Material is not accessed by Recipient or its Representatives\u2019 personnel except by any legal, compliance or information technology personnel in the course of their respective duties. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient shall as promptly as practicable confirm in writing such destruction to the Disclosing Party as required by this Section 8 (e-mail being sufficient).\nSection 9. No Representations and Warranties; No Liability; Definitive Agreement.\n(a) No Representations and Warranties. The Evaluation Material is being provided to the Recipient \u201cas is\u201d and without any representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied.

The Recipient understands and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives is under any duty or obligation to provide the Recipient with access to any information, and nothing herein is intended to impose any such obligation on the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives. The above Section 9(a) is qualified in its entirety by any provision to the contrary in a final and definitive agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction.\n\u30fc 6 \u30fc\n(b) No Liability. Recipient understands and agrees that the Evaluation Materials prepared by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives were prepared for their internal purposes only, and thus may not be suitable for the Recipient\u2019s purposes. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Recipient will make its own independent evaluation of the Proposed Transaction and will not be relying on the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives in connection with the Proposed Transaction and that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives is acting as the Recipient\u2019s broker or advisor in connection with the Proposed Transaction. The Recipient shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, pursue any action, suit or proceeding against the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives arising from or relating to the provision by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives to the Recipient and its Representatives of the Evaluation Material or the information contained therein. The above Section 9(b) is qualified in its entirety by any provision to the contrary in a final and definitive agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction.\n(c) Definitive Agreement. This Agreement does not constitute a binding agreement or obligation to reach a final and definitive agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction and no contract or agreement providing for any transaction shall be deemed to exist until a final and definitive agreement has been negotiated, fully executed and delivered. Unless and until such a definitive agreement with respect to the Proposed Transaction has been negotiated, fully executed and delivered, none of the Disclosing Party, its affiliates, or the Recipient (or its affiliates) shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction, or any other transaction or matter, by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically set forth herein. The Disclosing Party reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all offers and proposals made by the Recipient and to terminate discussions with the Recipient at any time.\nSection 10. Specific Performance.\n(a) Acknowledgment. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Agreement are of a special and unique nature, the breach of which may not be accurately compensated for in damages by an action at law, and that the breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by either party may cause the other party irreparable harm and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by either party.\n(b) Specific Performance. The parties hereby agree on behalf of themselves and their respective Representatives that the other party and their respective Representatives shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions (without the requirement of posting a bond, other security or any similar requirement or proving any actual damages), to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party or any of its Representatives and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties or their respective Representatives may be entitled at law or in equity.\nSection 11. [Intentionally Omitted]\nSection 12. Securities Laws. The Recipient hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and that Recipient shall advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, that the United States securities laws place certain restrictions on any person who has material, non-public information concerning an issuer, with respect to purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\nSection 13. Additional Matters.\n(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Disclosing Party acknowledges that the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s Representatives may be engaged in business in which the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s Representatives may compete with the Disclosing Party. Subject to compliance with the express restrictions herein, this Agreement shall not prevent the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s Representatives from conducting discussions or entering into transactions that are similar to the Proposed Transaction with other third parties or from engaging in business that is the same as, or similar to, the business conducted by the Disclosing Party or its affiliates.\n(b) For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to \u201caffiliates\u201d of the Disclosing Party shall mean controlled affiliates of the Disclosing Party.\n(c) The Disclosing Party acknowledges that one or more of KPS\u2019s employees, consultants and advisors may serve as board members, officers, employees or advisors of its portfolio companies (including the Recipient) (such individuals, \u201cDual Role Persons\u201d). No such portfolio company (other than Recipient) will be deemed to have received, or to have been made aware of, Evaluation Material solely due to such dual roles of such Dual Role Persons, so long as such Dual Role Persons do not provide any Evaluation Material to the other board members, officers, employees or advisors of such company (excluding other Dual Role Persons). KPS is not permitted to share Evaluation Material with its portfolio companies (other than the Recipient) without the further written approval of the Disclosing Party.\n(d) Without the Recipient\u2019s prior written consent, the Disclosing Party shall not, and shall direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any Person, any Transaction Information that would reasonably be expected to identify the Recipient or the identity of any of its affiliates. The Disclosing Party shall be responsible for any and all breaches of the terms of this clause by its Representatives (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any failure by its Representatives to comply with directions required hereunder). However, the foregoing shall not restrict any disclosures which the Disclosing Party or its Representatives determine in their discretion are required or advisable for legal or regulatory reasons, including disclosures to regulatory or self-regulatory authorities or pursuant to stock exchange rules or other disclosures which are customary for listed companies.\nSection 14. Miscellaneous.\n(a) Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications to any party or given under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered personally, by overnight delivery or courier or by registered mail to the parties at the address specified for such parties on the signature pages hereto (or at such other address as may be specified by a party in writing given at least five business days prior thereto).\n(b) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in one or more counterparts, and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed will be deemed an original, but all of which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument.\n\u30fc 8 \u30fc\n(c) Amendment of Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or waived except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.\n(d) Successors and Assigns; Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted assigns of, the parties hereto. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment or attempted assignment in contravention of this subsection shall be void ab initio and shall not relieve the assigning party of any obligation under this Agreement.\n(e) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that state, without reference to conflicts of laws provisions.\n(f) Integration. This Agreement contains and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any conflicting terms and conditions connected to a virtual dataroom or other document sharing platform, this Agreement shall control.\n(g) Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, public policy or other reason, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the protections afforded hereby are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible.\n(h) No Waiver; Remedies. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege. A single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege shall not preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.\n(i) No Third-Party Rights.

"      ""text"": ""Exhibit (d)(2)\nCONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis Confidentiality Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made by and between RetailMeNot, Inc. (\u201cRetailMeNot\u201d), and Valassis Communications, Inc. (\u201cValassis\u201d).\n1. Background. RetailMeNot and Valassis intend to engage in discussions and negotiations concerning a possible transaction involving RetailMeNot and/or its Affiliates in which Valassis and/or one or more of its Affiliates would acquire all or a substantial portion of the equity interests or business of RetailMeNot (\u201cPossible Transaction\u201d). An \u201cAffiliate\u201d of a specified person or entity includes any other person or entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such specified person or entity. For the purpose of evaluating, discussing, negotiating and/or implementing the Possible Transaction (the \u201cPurpose\u201d), it is anticipated that certain confidential information concerning each party (in such capacity, the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) and/or its respective Affiliates, including without limitation, confidential information and materials developed by or concerning the business, operations, plans, procedures, properties, assets, locations and financial affairs, pricing, supplier and customer information, names and expertise of employees and consultants, trade secrets and intellectual property of the Disclosing Party and/or its Affiliates, and past, present or future products or services, research, development, improvements, procedures, processes, techniques, designs, data, drawings, compilations, information, and technical information and data related to the business affairs and operations of the Disclosing Party and/or its Affiliates (the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) has been disclosed or delivered or will be disclosed or delivered, whether disclosed orally or disclosed or delivered in written, electronic or other form or media, by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party to the other party (in such capacity, the \u201cRecipient\u201d) and to certain of its Affiliates, and its and their respective general partners, managing members, directors, officers, employees, advisors and other representatives of the Recipient or such Affiliates, including attorneys, accountants, consultants, investment bankers and financing sources (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d). The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to Representatives who have a need to know such information in connection with the Purpose and whom the Recipient shall make aware of, and direct to comply with, the terms set forth herein. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach or failure to perform obligations expressly applicable to Representatives under this Agreement by its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Valassis will not share, and will not permit its Affiliates or Representatives to share, any Confidential Information with financing sources without the prior written consent of RetailMeNot, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. RetailMeNot hereby consents to Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of America Corporation and each of their respective Affiliates serving as debt financing sources to Valassis and/or its Affiliates.\n2. Confidential Information. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall be deemed to include any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives to the extent they contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any Confidential Information furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d does not include information which Recipient can demonstrate (a) was known by the Recipient or its Affiliates or Representatives in their capacity as such prior to the time of disclosure to the Recipient by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party, (b) was or becomes available to the public other than as a result of its disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (c) was, is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives in their capacity as such from a third party who is not known by the Recipient or such Representative to be under any obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party with respect thereto or otherwise prohibited from disclosing such information by any legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, or (d) was or is independently developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without use of the Confidential Information.\n3. Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Recipient, and its Representatives who have received Confidential Information pursuant hereto, shall use the Confidential Information only for the Purpose. The Confidential Information shall not be used for any other purpose without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. The Recipient and such Representatives shall hold the Confidential Information in confidence, and provide it with at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances, and shall not disclose any Confidential Information, except as permitted by paragraph 1 hereof or where such disclosure is requested or required by law, regulation (including, without limitation, any rule, regulation or policy statement of any organized securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of an entity\u2019s securities are listed or quoted), regulatory body, judicial process, or listing agreement (collectively, \u201cLaw\u201d). The Recipient agrees, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, to give the Disclosing Party notice of any such request or requirement as soon as reasonably practicable so that the Disclosing Party may, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s own expense, seek a protective order, confidential treatment request or other appropriate remedy, and the Recipient shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Disclosing Party in obtaining such order or remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order, the Recipient is nonetheless compelled to disclose Confidential Information, the Recipient may disclose without liability hereunder that portion of the Confidential Information which the Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled to disclose.\n4. Additional Non-Disclosure Obligations. Except where such disclosure is requested or required by Law (and then subject to the applicable terms of Section 3 above), without the prior written consent of the other party, each of the Disclosing Party and the Recipient will not, and each will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any person or entity (other than its Representatives) (a) that the Confidential Information has been made available to the Recipient or its Representatives, (b) that investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning a Possible Transaction, or (c) any terms or other facts with respect to the Possible Transaction, including the status or existence thereof.\n5. Ownership of Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to transfer ownership of Confidential Information or any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights therein. No license or conveyance of any such rights to the Recipient is granted or implied under this Agreement.\n6. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party may elect at any time to terminate further access by the Recipient and its Representatives to the Confidential Information. The Recipient shall, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, at its sole election, promptly, and in any event within 10 business days, either return or destroy all Confidential Information received by the Recipient and its Representatives (and all copies and reproductions thereof). Any destruction of materials shall be confirmed by the Recipient in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient and its Representatives may each retain copies of the Confidential Information for compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, bona fide data retention policies or to establish its rights under this Agreement. Any Confidential Information that cannot be or is not returned or destroyed (such as oral Confidential Information) shall remain confidential, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n7. No Representations or Warranties. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, except as may be set forth in a definitive agreement with respect to the Possible Transaction. The Recipient agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives relating to or resulting from the Recipient\u2019s or their use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom except as may be set forth in a definitive agreement with respect to the Possible Transaction. To the extent Confidential Information includes materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Recipient or any of its Representatives.\n8. No Obligation to Consummate a Possible Transaction. This Agreement binds the parties only with respect to the matters expressly set forth herein. As such, unless and until a definitive written agreement regarding a Possible Transaction between the Disclosing Party and the Recipient has been executed, (a) neither the Disclosing Party nor the Recipient nor their respective Representatives or Affiliates will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to negotiate or consummate a Possible Transaction and (b) neither party will have any claim whatsoever against the other party or its Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, members, shareholders or representatives arising out of or relating to any Possible Transaction, except pursuant to this Agreement.\n9. Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto agree that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of this Agreement, and that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to a party.\n10. No Waiver. No failure or delay by the parties hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial waiver thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder.\n11. Termination. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect during the term hereof regardless of whether the parties negotiate or consummate a Possible Transaction. This Agreement will terminate automatically upon the earlier of (a) 24 months after the date hereof, or (b) the date on which a definitive binding agreement, if any, with respect to the Possible Transaction is entered into between the Disclosing Party and the Recipient or their respective Affiliates.\n12. Choice of Law. This Agreement shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable laws, be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States applicable in Delaware, as applied to contracts made and to be performed entirely within Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflict of law requiring the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Delaware, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n13. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Disclosing Party shall not assign this Agreement, or delegate its duties or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Recipient. Any purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void and unenforceable.\n14. Authority. Each party represents and warrants that it possesses all necessary powers and authority to enter into and be bound by this Agreement.\n15. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person, place or circumstance, shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable or void, the remainder of this Agreement and such provision as applied to other persons, places or circumstances shall remain in full force and effect.\n16. Costs. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, each party shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Possible Transaction, including the negotiation, preparation and execution of this agreement and its evaluation and review of any Confidential Information.\n17. Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered as follows, with notice deemed given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery, when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier, upon written verification of receipt; (c) by e-mail or facsimile transmission, upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission; or (d) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification of receipt. Notice shall be sent to the addresses set forth above or to such other address as either party may provide in writing.\n18. Miscellaneous. This Agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior agreements, written or oral, (ii) may not be amended, except in writing executed by duly authorized officers or agents of each of the parties and (iii) may be executed in counterparts, including by facsimile or electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the United States federal ESIGN Act of 2000).\n19. Non-Solicitation. For a period of 12 months after the date of this Agreement, the Recipient agrees not to, directly or indirectly, induce, recruit, encourage or solicit for employment, offer employment to, employ, or engage as an independent contractor (the \u201cProhibited Activities\u201d), (i) any members of the executive management team of the Disclosing Party or (ii) any other employee of the Disclosing Party to whom the Recipient was introduced, exposed, or whom it became aware of as a result of the consideration, evaluation or negotiation of a Possible Transaction (any such person described in clauses (i) or (ii), a \u201cCovered Employee\u201d); provided that the Recipient shall not be restricted from placing in general circulation (which shall include websites or mobile applications such as Indeed, Linkedin, Monster.com, Craigslist or the like) any solicitation for employment (including advertisements placed by a recruiting firm or similar organization) not specifically directed toward any of the Covered Employees or from employing any person who responds thereto; provided, further, that the restrictions of this paragraph shall not apply to any Covered Employee who has not been employed by the Disclosing Party for a period of at least three months prior to such solicitation or hiring, as the case may be.\n20. Standstill. In consideration of, and only upon, the Confidential Information being furnished to Valassis pursuant to this Agreement, Valassis agrees that, for a period of 12 months from the date of this Agreement (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), Valassis shall not, directly or indirectly (through any of its Affiliates or its and their respective Representatives with knowledge of the Possible Transaction), unless specifically approved in advance by the Board of Directors of RetailMeNot (the \u201cBoard\u201d) in writing:\n(a) in any manner acting alone or in concert with others, acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal or offer to acquire or effect, directly or indirectly, by means of purchase, merger, business combination or in any other manner, beneficial ownership of any securities of

with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of RetailMeNot,\n(c) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) with respect to any voting securities of RetailMeNot,\n(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control, advise, change or influence the management, board of directors, governing instruments, policies or affairs of RetailMeNot,\n(e) make any public disclosure, or take any action that would reasonably be expected to

shall prevent Valassis or any person acting on its behalf from making any proposal regarding a business combination or other transaction directly to the Board or Chief Executive Officer of RetailMeNot on a confidential basis and from discussing such proposal with such persons if such proposal would not reasonably be expected to require RetailMeNot to make a public announcement and (iii) the Standstill Period shall terminate, and the restrictions set forth in this Section 20 shall terminate and be of no further force and effect, (A) if RetailMeNot enters into a definitive agreement with a party other than Valassis or its Affiliates with respect to, or publicly announces that it plans to enter into, a transaction involving 30% or more of RetailMeNot\u2019s then-outstanding equity securities or assets (or equity securities of subsidiaries of RetailMeNot holding assets) constituting 35% or more of the consolidated assets of RetailMeNot and its subsidiaries (whether by merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer, recapitalization, restructuring, sale, equity issuance or otherwise) (an \u201cAlternative Transaction\u201d), (B) if RetailMeNot publicly announces or confirms that it is in discussions with one or more parties with respect to an Alternative Transaction, or (C) in the event of any announcement or commencement by any person, entity or \u201cgroup\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of a tender or exchange offer to acquire RetailMeNot\u2019s equity securities which, if successful, would result in such person, entity or group owning, when combined with any other equity securities of RetailMeNot owned by such person, entity or group, 30% or more of RetailMeNot\u2019s then outstanding equity securities.\nIn the event that, during the Standstill Period, in connection with the evaluation, discussion, negotiation and/or implementation of a possible Alternative Transaction (i) RetailMeNot enters into a confidentiality agreement that does not include \u201cstandstill\u201d restrictions similar to those included in this Section 20, or (ii) RetailMeNot enters into a confidentiality agreement that includes \u201cstandstill\u201d restrictions for a term shorter than twelve months or otherwise less restrictive in any material respect than the restrictions set forth in this Section 20, then RetailMeNot shall promptly inform Valassis in writing and, in the case of the preceding clause (i), the Standstill Period shall terminate or, in the case of the preceding clause (ii), such shorter term and/or other materially less restrictive provision(s) shall supersede and be deemed to replace the twelve month restrictive period and/or other more restrictive provision(s) set forth in this Section 20, in each case immediately and without any further action of the parties.\n21.

The Disclosing Party acknowledges that the Recipient and/or its Affiliates are engaged in businesses similar to or the same as the Disclosing Party, and that neither the execution of this Agreement nor receipt of Confidential Information is intended to or shall restrict their ability to compete with the Disclosing Party in the ordinary course of business without using Confidential Information in that capacity.\nThe parties have executed this Agreement on the last date set forth below.\nRETAILMENOT, INC\nBy: /s/ Jonathan Kaplan\nName: Jonathan Kaplan\nTitle: General Counsel and Secretary\nDate: 1/10/2017\n301 Congress Avenue, Suite 600\nAustin, Texas 78701\nAttention: General Counsel\nkaplan@rmn.com\nVALASSIS COMMUNICATIONS, INC.\nBy: /s/ Edward Taibi\nName: Edward Taibi\nTitle: Director\nDate: 1/10/2017\nAddress:35 E. 62 Street\nNY NY 10065\n[Signature Page to Confidentiality Agreement]\n"",

As used in this Agreement, in each case where a party is disclosing Proprietary Information that party is referred to as the \""Disclosing Party\"" and the party receiving such Confidential Information is referred to as the \""Recipient\"".\n2. Recipient agrees to hold Proprietary Information in confidence and to protect it against disclosure to the public and third parties. Accordingly, Recipient shall employ protective measures fully commensurate with those used by Recipient to protect its own trade secrets and other confidential information from disclosure to the public and to third parties. Such measures shall include restricting access to Proprietary Information only to Recipient's employees or agents whose access is reasonably necessary to carry out the Purpose and who have legally enforceable obligations to Recipient that would conform to the obligations of this Agreement.\n3. Recipient agrees to use Proprietary Information only for the Purpose. Proprietary Information shall not be reproduced in any other form except as required to accomplish the Purpose\n4. Recipient agrees not to reverse-engineer or have a third party reverse-engineer the Proprietary Information without first obtaining the express, written consent of Discloser.\n5. The obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on use set forth in Paragraph 2 above do not apply to information that Recipient can demonstrate by competent physical evidence:\n(a) Was already known by Recipient prior to receipt from Discloser or becomes known by Recipient independently of Discloser through no wrongful act of Recipient;\n(b) is now, or becomes, publicly known through no violation of this Agreement;\n(c) is disclosed pursuant to law, regulation or lawful order or process, provided that Recipient promptly notifies Discloser so as to permit Discloser to oppose or limit such disclosure; or\n(d) is approved in writing by Discloser for disclosure to a third party by Recipient.\nProprietary Information disclosed by Discloser to Recipient shall not be deemed to come under the above exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is or becomes subject to the above exceptions. In addition, any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are in the public domain or in the possession of the Recipient, but only if the combination itself and its principle of operation are in the public domain or in the possession of the Recipient.\n6. Neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the disclosure of any Proprietary Information hereunder, shall be construed as granting Recipient any immunity or license to use Proprietary Information in any way {whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise), or any right to ownership, with respect to Proprietary Information or other intellectual property right(s) now or hereafter owned or controlled by Discloser.\n7. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to impose any obligation on Discloser to disclose information to the Recipient, or to enter into any other agreement of any nature. This Agreement is for protecting Proprietary Information only. No rights or obligations other than those expressly recited herein are granted or to be implied from this Agreement.\n8. Discloser makes no representations, extends no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, and assumes no responsibilities whatsoever with respect to the adequacy, accuracy, completeness, operability, fitness for a particular purpose, or utility of any information, including Proprietary Information, obtained or used by Recipient under this Agreement. The information, including Proprietary Information, is provided \""AS IS,\"" without warranty or guarantee of any kind and Discloser shall not be liable to the Recipient for any damages, loss, expense or claim of loss arising of any kind from the use of or reliance upon such information, including Proprietary Information.\n9. This Agreement, and the relationship between the Parties pursuant thereto, shall be construed, interpreted and applied in accordance with the laws of Province of Ontario without reference to any conflict of law provisions thereof.\n10. Recipient agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of all countries involved in the data transfers.\n11. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties related to confidentiality and limited use of Proprietary Information.\n12. Duplicate counterparts of this Agreement may be executed and delivered, each of which shall be considered an original. All additions or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and executed by the Parties.\n13. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period two (2) years, unless terminated earlier on thirty (30) days written notice provided by either Party. However, the obligations of confidentiality and limited use of Proprietary Information shall survive the termination of the Agreement.\n14. This Agreement is divisible and separable so that if any provision or provisions hereof shall be held to be invalid, void, voidable or unenforceable, such holding shall not impair the remaining provisions hereof. If any provision hereof is held to be too broad to be enforced, such provision shall be construed to create an obligation to the full extent allowable.\n15. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Recipient of any of the provisions of the Agreement, Discloser, in addition to any other remedies available to it under law, at equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek an injunction restraining Recipient from the performance of acts that constitute a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.\n16. This Agreement may not be assigned, delegated, sold or transferred, whether by operation of law or otherwise, by Recipient without the prior written consent of Discloser, and any attempted delegation or transfer of rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement without such written consent shall be void and of no effect.\n17.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d), (together, the \u201cParties\u201d).\nWHEREAS, The Parties desire to exchange information, including certain financial, technical, product, operations and other business information solely for the purpose of evaluating a potential acquisition of NXP by the Company or a comparable negotiated transaction between the Company and NXP (the \u201cPermitted Purpose\u201d or the \u201cTransaction\u201d).\nNOW, THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n1. Confidential Information\nFor the purposes of this Agreement \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all information concerning or provided by the disclosing Party (\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) to the receiving Party (\u201cReceiving Party\u201d) or its Representatives (whether in writing, or in oral, graphic, electronic or any other form and including information made available or furnished prior to the date hereof) that is reasonably understood by the Receiving Party from the context of disclosure or from the information itself, to be confidential, and any report, analysis, compilation, study, interpretation, forecast, model, interpretation, third-party agreements or materials, trade secrets, customer and supplier information, product information, product roadmaps, records, memoranda or other material prepared or maintained by the Receiving Party, in whatever form (whether documentary, computer storage or otherwise) to the extent containing, reflecting, derived from, based upon or referring to, in whole or in part, any such information. \u201cRepresentatives\u201d means, with respect to a Party, such Party\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, consultants, accountants, financial and legal advisors and, with and subject to the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, any actual or potential sources of debt financing (including any affiliate of any financial advisor acting in such capacity and their counsel) and other representatives which are identified to the Disclosing Party and who shall be subject to confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as a Receiving Party hereto. The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d does not include any potential equity investors or co-bidders and nothing in this Agreement shall permit the Receiving Party or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, to enter into any discussions, negotiations, arrangements or understandings with, or to share any Confidential Information with, any person with respect to participation as an equity investor or as a co-bidder in connection with any possible Transaction, or to propose to any other person to participate as an equity investor or as a co-bidder in connection with any possible Transaction or to advise, assist, encourage, act as an equity financing source for or otherwise invest in any other person in connection with any of the foregoing activities.\n2. Obligations of Confidentiality\nEach Party recognizes and acknowledges the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that could result to the Disclosing Party if Confidential Information contained therein is disclosed to any person. As a condition to and in consideration of Confidential Information being provided to the Receiving Party and its Representatives, each Receiving Party undertakes and agrees as follows:\n(a) to hold and cause its Representatives to hold Confidential Information provided hereunder now or in the future in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and not to disclose or permit it to be disclosed to any person, firm or company other than the Receiving Party\u2019s Representatives who need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose;\n(b) only to use the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose and not for any other purpose;\n(c) to ensure that each Representative to whom disclosure of Confidential Information is made by the Receiving Party is fully aware in advance of the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations under this Agreement and to take full responsibility and remain fully liable for any actions or omissions of its Representatives that are not in accordance with this Agreement; and\n(d) to keep confidential and not reveal to any person, firm or company (other than Representatives) the fact that Confidential Information has been made available in connection with the Permitted Purpose, that discussions or negotiations are taking place or have taken place between the Parties concerning a potential Transaction between the Parties, including the status of such discussions or the termination of such discussions or negotiations, or any opinions or view with respect to the Confidential Information.\nEach Party hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and it will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that Confidential Information may include material non-public information and that United States securities laws impose restrictions on trading securities when in possession of such information and on communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to trade in such securities.\nNeither Party nor its Representatives will initiate any communications with any Representatives of the other Party concerning the Confidential Information, nor shall either Party or its Representatives contact any member of management or any employee of the other Party or any customers, suppliers or other third parties that conduct business with the other Party, in each case other than (a) individuals who have been specifically designated and approved by the other Party for such communications and (b) customers, suppliers or other third parties that the Party or its Representatives communicate with in the ordinary course of their respective businesses so long as such communications are made in the ordinary course of business and do not reference any Confidential Information.\n3. Exceptions\nThe obligations of Sections 2(a)-(c) of this Agreement shall not apply to any information which is (i) now or becomes generally available to the public in the future, other than through acts or omissions of the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement, (ii) lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from sources independent of Disclosing Party; provided such source was not, to the Receiving Party\u2019s knowledge, bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party or otherwise prohibited from transmitting such information by contractual, legal, fiduciary or other obligation, or (iii) independently developed by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party\u2019s Representatives without the benefit or usage of or reference to the Confidential Information. The fact that information included in the Confidential Information is or becomes otherwise available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives under clauses (i) through (iii) above shall not relieve the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the prohibitions of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement with respect to the balance of the Confidential Information.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event that either Party or any of its Representatives is required (by law, regulation, court order or legal process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or any of the information which is subject to the provisions of Section 2(d) above, such Party will provide the other Party with prompt written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure so that such Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained within the time limit of the requested or legally required disclosure, the Party compelled to disclose Confidential Information will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information or take only such action as is requested or legally required based upon the advice of its legal counsel and will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information (or other information required to be kept confidential pursuant to this Agreement) so furnished. The Receiving Party shall cooperate with any reasonable action requested by the Disclosing Party to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information.\n4. Return of Confidential Information; Limited Access Confidential Information\n(a) If either Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Transaction, such Party will promptly inform the other Party of that decision. In that case, or at any time at the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to Disclosing Party, or, with the Disclosing Party\u2019s written permission, destroy, and certify to the Disclosing Party in writing such destruction of, all materials (in whatever form) constituting Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including any notes, copies, summaries, extracts or other tangible embodiments thereof in whole or in part thereof, and such materials shall not be retained by the Receiving Party in any form or for any reason. All Confidential Information stored electronically shall be permanently deleted. Thereafter, the Receiving Party shall not use such Confidential Information in any way for any purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing (subject to Section 4(b)), (i) the obligations set forth in the second and third sentences of this Section 4(a) shall not apply to Confidential Information that the Receiving Party stores on backup disks or in backup storage facilities automatically produced in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or by any applicable law, regulation, court order or legal process and (ii) Representatives of a Receiving Party that are accounting firms, investment banks or similar organizations may, subject to the terms of this Agreement, retain copies of the Confidential Information in accordance with policies and procedures implemented by such persons in order to comply with applicable law, regulation or professional standards or reasonable business practices; provided that such Representatives do not provide the Receiving Party with access to any such retained Confidential Information, in each case it being understood that such Confidential Information must be kept confidential in accordance with this Agreement.\n(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain highly-sensitive Confidential Information may in the reasonable discretion of the Disclosing Party be designated \u201cAttorneys Eyes\u2019 Only\u201d (collectively, \u201cLimited Access Confidential Information\u201d). The Receiving Party agrees that access to Limited Access Confidential Information shall be granted only to attorney Representatives who have been pre-approved in writing (which may be by email) by the Disclosing Party (\u201cDesignated Representatives\u201d). Without limiting the confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 2, the Receiving Party shall ensure that Limited Access Confidential Information (including any notes, extracts, summaries, copies or tangible embodiments thereof) is not disclosed to any Representative other than Designated Representatives; it being understood that the Designated Representatives can provide the Receiving Party with written or oral legal advice or analyses based on the review of such Limited Access Confidential Information. Without limiting Section 2(c), the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Designated Representatives. With respect to Limited Access Confidential Information (including any notes, copies or tangible embodiments thereof), the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations under Section 2 shall apply in perpetuity (unless one or more of the exceptions set forth in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 3 applies). Upon termination of this Agreement or the request of the Disclosing Party, all notes, extracts, summaries, copies or tangible embodiments of Limited Access Confidential Information shall be permanently deleted and not retained by the Receiving Party, without exception, other than attorney work product and analyses based on the review of Limited Access Confidential Information by Designated Representatives that the Receiving Party stores on backup disks or in backup storage facilities automatically produced in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or by any applicable law, regulation, court order or legal process.\n5.

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any right or license to the Confidential Information or any intellectual property rights except for the limited right to use such Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose as expressly set forth herein.\n(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate the Parties to proceed with any business relationship and each Party may terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement.

Accordingly, all Confidential Information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege or doctrine shall remain entitled to protection thereunder and shall be entitled to protection under the joint defense doctrine, and it agrees to take all measures necessary to preserve, to the fullest extent possible, the applicability of all such privileges and doctrines.\n6. NON-Solicitation\nFor a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending one (1) year thereafter (the \u201cSpecified Period\u201d), each Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment any \u201cQualifying Person,\u201d provided, however, that this section will not prevent either Party from: (a) engaging in discussions with a Qualifying Person where s/he has contacted such Party in response to (i) any general advertisement, job posting or similar notice; or (ii) an unsolicited resume or request for information from a Qualifying Person; or (b) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit persons for employment on behalf of such Party, or soliciting the employment of any specified officer or employee of a Party who is identified by any such recruiting firm or organization, in each case as long as such recruiting firm or organization does not directly target any officers or employees of a Party \u201cQualifying Person\u201d shall mean any person who is an officer or employee of the other Party, who was introduced in person, by phone or email to the Party or its affiliates during the Specified Period in connection with evaluating a potential Transaction. \u201cQualifying Person\u201d does not include any person whose employment with a Party was or is terminated by such Party, or who has received written notice that his/her employment with such Party will be terminated.\n7.

Without limiting the foregoing, the following provisions shall survive termination of this Agreement: Sections 1-5 and 7-10 and Section 12.\n8. Remedies\nWithout limiting other remedies that may be available to the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party agrees that damages may not be an adequate remedy for any breach (whether actual or threatened) of the provisions of this Agreement and that accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief.\n9.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, acquisitions for investment purposes only of exchange-traded funds by a Party, that own or later acquire any economic interest in, any right to direct the voting or disposition of, or any other right with respect to any securities of the other Party or any of its subsidiaries, shall not constitute a breach of this Section 11.\n12.

Each party understands and agrees that it will be disclosing to the other party and/or its Representatives under this Agreement (i) information solely for the purpose of enabling the receiving party and its Representatives to evaluate a Transaction, and reasonably believes that such disclosure will not affect, in any way, the parties\u2019 relative competitive position with respect to each other or to any third parties (including any of the parties\u2019 affiliates), and (ii) only that information which is reasonably necessary to enable each party and its Representatives to evaluate a Transaction (and that information which is not reasonably necessary for such purpose will not be disclosed to a party or its Representatives). For purposes of determining when information is reasonably necessary for such purpose, the parties may request that legal counsel to each party agree, in advance, to review certain information requests so as to comply with such standard. In addition, each party understands and agrees that review of competitively sensitive information, such as information concerning product development or marketing plans, product prices or pricing plans, cost data, customers or similar information, which has been determined to be reasonably necessary to evaluate a Transaction will be limited only to those senior executives of the receiving party and its Representatives who are involved in evaluating or negotiating a Transaction or approving the value of a Transaction. If Evaluation Material includes software in object code form, the receiving party shall not, and shall not permit any other party to, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble such object code, or take any other steps to derive a source code equivalent thereof.\n(3) Non-Disclosure and Use of Evaluation Material. Each party agrees that it shall (and it shall cause its Representatives to) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Transaction and for no other purpose, and that the receiving party shall (and shall cause its Representatives to) keep the Evaluation Material confidential and not disclose any Evaluation Material to any third party; provided, however, that the receiving party may disclose any Evaluation Material (x) if the disclosing party gives its prior express written consent to such disclosure, or (y) to its Representatives who are actively or directly participating in its evaluation of a Transaction or who otherwise need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating a Transaction (and the receiving party shall take appropriate measures to ensure that its Representatives comply with the terms of this Agreement).\n(4) Required Disclosure. In the event that a party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law, regulation (including, without limitation, any rule or regulation of any national securities exchange or stock market on which any of the receiving party\u2019s securities are listed or quoted) or legal process to disclose any of the Evaluation Material, the party requested or required to make the disclosure shall, unless legally prohibited from doing so, provide the other party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the other party to (i) seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, (ii) consult with the party requested or required to make the disclosure and its Representatives with respect to taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process (and such party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in this respect and, if such cooperation is material, at the other party\u2019s sole expense), or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the disclosing party, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, upon the advice of outside counsel, legally compelled to disclose any Evaluation Material, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or any of its Representatives may disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which is legally required to be disclosed based on the advice of outside counsel, provided that the party requested or required to make the disclosure uses reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with the disclosing party (and, if such cooperation is material, at the disclosing party\u2019s sole expense) to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material.\n(5) Privileged Information. To the extent that any Evaluation Material may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have common legal interests with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided by a party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.\n(6) Termination of Discussions. All Evaluation Material shall remain the property of the disclosing party and the receiving party agrees not to assert any claim of title or ownership in the disclosing party\u2019s Evaluation Material or any portion thereof. If either party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Transaction, such party shall promptly inform the other party of that decision by giving a written notice of termination. At any time upon the request of either disclosing party for any reason, each receiving party and its Representatives shall promptly deliver to the disclosing party or destroy all Evaluation Material (and all copies, reproductions thereof) furnished to the receiving party or its Representatives by or on behalf of the disclosing party pursuant hereto (whether in hard-copy form or on intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files), provided, however, that, the receiving party or its Representatives shall not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Evaluation Material held electronically in archive or backup systems in accordance with general systems archiving and backup policies. Upon the request of the disclosing party, a duly authorized representative of the receiving party shall certify to the disclosing party that the receiving party and its Representatives have complied with this paragraph (6). Notwithstanding the return or destruction of all Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n(7) No Representation of Accuracy. Each party understands and acknowledges that neither party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material made available by the disclosing party or on its behalf to the receiving party or its Representatives. Each party agrees that neither party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the other party or any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of or reliance upon any Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding the Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n(8) Definitive Agreements. Each party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, and until such time, neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to provide or not provide Evaluation Material to the other party or its Representatives under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction between the parties, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.\n(9) Standstill.

In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Mellet and Sweetskinz shall be sometimes collectively be referred to as \u201cParties\"". It is understood further that changes to this Agreement must be in writing and acknowledged by the Parties.\nThe Agreement contains material restrictions on Mellet\u2019s right to (i) compete with Sweetskinz, or (ii) disclose or use information learned or developed by Mellet through his association with or as an employee of Sweetskinz from the beginning of time through April 4, 2016 (\u201cTerm\u201d).\n1. CONSIDERATION\nMellet shall receive 5,123,878 shares of Sweetskinz common stock (\u201cShares\u201d) as full consideration for this Agreement.\n2. NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION\n(a) In consideration of Sweetskinz\u2019s agreement to provide Mellet with the Shares, Mellet agrees:\n(1) to refrain, directly or indirectly, during the Term from accepting business from, doing business with, inducing or soliciting any Sweetksinz customers to whom Mellet rendered any services during the course of Mellet\u2019s employment with Sweeetskinz, to do business with Mellet, or with any other person or entity, in competition with the type of services performed by Mellet for Sweetskinz except on behalf of and as an authorized representative of Sweetskinz.\n(2) to refrain, directly or indirectly, during the Term from accepting business from, doing business with or inducing or soliciting, any Sweetskinz vendor who is instrumental in any aspect of the design, development, production or sales of any Sweetskinz product.\n(3) to refrain, directly or indirectly, during the Term from having any interest in or association with any business which competes with Sweetskinz pneumatic colorized tire products or any other future Products produced by Sweetskinz. Such entities shall include any related entity in which Mellet or his immediate family is a shareholder, director, officer, employee, partner, proprietor, joint venturer, consultant or otherwise, anywhere worldwide.\n(4) any idea, concept, technique, invention, creation, copyrightable or patentable work (\""Product\"") relating to pneumatic colorized tires or other products sold or developed by Sweetskinz, that Mellet is instrumental in creating, developing or producing, or helping to create, develop or produce, during the time that Mellet is employed by Sweetskinz shall be considered owned by Sweetskinz, whether conceived by Mellet individually or jointly, on or off Sweetskinz's premises. Mellet hereby irrevocably assigns such Product to Sweetskinz and authorizes Sweetskinz to execute on Mellet\u2019s behalf such documents as it may deem necessary to confirm and protect its interests therein. However, Mellet may develop products which do not in any material way compete with any Product of Sweeetskinz so long as such development is of no cost to Sweetskinz, is done after \u201cworking hours\u201d (defined as 45-hour work week) and does not interfere with Mellet\u2019s responsibilities as the Chief Technology Officer of Sweetskinz.\nMellet acknowledges that this Section 2 is reasonable, among other things, because Sweetskinz anticipates selling its products on all continents of the world and developing relationships with manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers on such continents\n3. CONFIDENTIALITY:\nEach Party agrees at all times during the Term to hold in the strictest confidence, and not use, except for the benefit of the Parties or to disclose, transfer or reveal, directly or indirectly to any person or entity any confidential information.\n4. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:\nIf Sweetskinz so elects, Sweetskinz shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies available, including but not limited to actual, compensatory and punitive damages, or to specifically enforce the performance by Mellet and to enjoin the violation by Mellet of any provision hereof. Moreover, the parties hereto acknowledge that the damages suffered by Sweetskinz as a result of any violations of Section 2 by Mellet may be difficult to ascertain and Sweetskinz may not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that in the event of a breach by Mellet of Paragraph 2, Sweetskinz shall be entitled to specific enforcement by injunctive relief of Mellet\u2019s obligations to Sweetskinz, without bond and such remedies shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other remedies available to Sweetskinz, by judicial or arbitral proceedings or otherwise.\nThe remedies referred to above shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other remedies available to Sweetskinz, by judicial or arbitral proceedings or otherwise, including to enforce the performance or observation of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.\n5. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES:\nIt is agreed that if any legal action or other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of this Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any provision of this Agreement the successful Party or Parties, as the case may be, shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other costs incurred in that proceeding in addition to any other relief or judgment to which it may be entitled.\n6. GENERAL:\nThe obligations under the Agreement are binding upon the heirs, assigns and legal representatives. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Pennsylvania. If any of this Agreement is more restrictive than permitted by law in any jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought, this Agreement will be limited only to the extent necessary to bring this Agreement within the law of such jurisdiction and other provisions of the Agreement will remain in force.\nThe parties signing below have read and understood this Agreement and agree to its terms and conditions.\nApril 6, 2006\nSWEETSKINZ, INC.\nBy: /s/ Andrew Boyland\nAndrew Boyland\nChief Executive Officer\n/s/ Yann Mellet\nMr. Yann Mellet\n"",

If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver, such first party or any of its Representatives are nonetheless legally compelled by any requirement described in the first sentence of this Section 4 to disclose the Evaluation Material to such third party, such party or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such third party only that portion of the Evaluation Material, or of the facts relating to the discussions taking place, which its counsel advises in writing is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such party exercises reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the discussions taking place, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the other party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded thereto by any third party to which disclosure is made.\n5. Privileged Information. To the extent that any Evaluation Material may include material or information that is subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their mutual desire, intention and understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege.

The Seller also agrees during such period not to publicly request you (or your Representatives), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this section (including this sentence). The Seller represents and warrants that, as of the date of this Agreement, neither you nor any of your affiliates owns, of record or beneficially, any voting securities of the Seller, or any securities convertible into or exercisable for any voting securities of the Seller (other than such ownership by your affiliates of up to an aggregate of 1% of such securities).\n8.

Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you and your Representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations of confidentiality and nonuse and other obligations hereunder for a period of two years from the date first set forth above.\n9. Non-Solicitation. In consideration of the Evaluation Material being furnished to you, you agree that for a period of two years from the date hereof, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or employ any of the employees of the Seller while such employees remain employed by the Seller or its affiliates, provided, that this Agreement shall not prohibit (i) any general advertisement or general solicitation that is not specifically targeted at such persons; or (ii) the hiring of any such persons who initiate discussions with you regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you.\n10. No Representation of Accuracy. You understand and acknowledge that the Seller and its Representatives: (i) make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (ii) shall have no liability to you or your Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of or reliance upon the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties which are made in a definitive agreement regarding the Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n11. Waiver. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n12. Contacts. You agree that none of you or your Representatives who are aware of the Evaluation Material and/or a Possible Transaction will initiate or cause to be initiated any communication with any director, officer or employee of the Seller concerning the Evaluation Material or a Possible Transaction, provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any communication with the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seller or any person identified by the Seller or its Representatives to you or your Representatives as having knowledge of a Possible Transaction.\n13.

It is further agreed by you that an order of specific performance or for injunctive relief against you in the event of a breach or default under the terms of this Agreement would be equitable and would not work a hardship on you. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or default by you hereunder, the Seller, without any bond or other security being required and in addition to whatever other remedies are or might be available at law or in equity, shall have the right either to compel specific performance by, or to obtain injunctive relief against you, with respect to any obligation or duty herein or breach thereof. You agree to reimburse the Seller for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees and expenses) of enforcing the Seller\u2019s rights under this Agreement. This Section shall not operate to limit any other rights or remedies of the Seller.\n14. Severability. In case any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and such provision will be deemed to be restated to reflect the original intention of the parties as nearly as possible in accordance with applicable law.\n15. No Definitive Agreement.

As a condition to our furnishing any such information to you and your Representatives (as defined below), you agree to treat such information in strict confidence in accordance with the provisions of this Non-Disclosure Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), and to take or refrain from taking the other actions as hereinafter expressly set forth.\nAs used in this Agreement, (i) the term \u201cRepresentative\u201d means, as to any person, such person\u2019s affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, general partners, managers, members, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, legal counsel and accountants), and with the written consent (including via email, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Company or as referenced on the attached Schedule A of this Agreement any consultants and potential financing sources; (ii) the term \u201caffiliate\u201d has the meaning given to that term in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d); and (iii) the term \u201cperson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to mean all natural and legal persons, including, without limitation, any company, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other entity.\n1. Evaluation Material.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means all information concerning the Company (whether furnished on or after the date hereof, whether prepared by the Company, its Representatives or otherwise, whether or not marked as being confidential, and irrespective of the form of communication, including oral as well as written and electronic communications) that is furnished to you or to your Representatives by or on behalf of the Company. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d also includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations and other documents prepared by you or your Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information that the Company or the Company\u2019s Representatives furnish to you or your Representatives. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include information that (a) has become generally known to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (b) was within your possession prior to it being furnished to you by or on behalf of the Company; provided, that the source of such information was not known by you (or reasonably should be known by you) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any other party with respect to such information, (c) has become available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or any of the Company\u2019s Representatives if such source is not known by you (and should not reasonably be known by you) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or any other contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any other party with respect to such information, or (d) was independently developed by you without reference to any confidential information disclosed by the Company.\n2. Evaluation Material and Confidentiality.\nYou and your Representatives shall use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of considering, evaluating and negotiating a Transaction, shall not use any of the Evaluation Material for any other purpose, shall keep the Evaluation Material strictly confidential, and, except as provided in this Section 2 and in Section 4, shall not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever without the prior written consent of the Company; provided, however, that the Evaluation Material may be disclosed to your Representatives who need to know the information so disclosed for the purpose of evaluating or advising you with respect to considering, evaluating and negotiating a Transaction, and who are directed by you to keep such Evaluation Material confidential and who are provided with a copy of this Agreement. You shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of your Representatives, and you agree, at your sole expense, to take all commercially reasonable measures to assure that your Representatives do not make any prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use (including in legal proceedings to the extent set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement) of the Evaluation Material. Without limiting the foregoing, neither you nor any of your affiliates or Representatives shall use any information obtained from the Evaluation Material to divert or attempt to divert any business or customer of the Company, or otherwise use any such information competitively against the Company.\n3. Transaction Information, Discussions and Confidentiality.\nExcept as set forth in Sections 2 and 4 of this Agreement, you agree that without the prior written consent of Vocus, neither you nor any of your Representatives shall disclose to any person the existence of this Agreement, the fact that the Evaluation Material exists or has been made available to you or any of your Representatives, the fact that you have any interest in pursuing a Transaction involving the Company, the fact that discussions or negotiations concerning a Transaction are or may be taking place, or have taken place between you and the Company (and/or any of the Company\u2019s Representatives), or any of the terms, conditions or other matters discussed between you and the Company (and/or any of the Company\u2019s Representatives) with respect thereto (the foregoing such information described in this sentence being hereafter referred to collectively as \u201cTransaction Information\u201d). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and for purposes of clarification, except with the prior written consent of Vocus, you agree that neither you nor any of your Representatives acting on your behalf shall enter into any discussions or any agreement, understanding, plan or arrangement with any person regarding any equity or co-investment participation by that person or others with you in a Transaction and you shall not enter into any exclusivity agreement or arrangement with respect to a Transaction with any bank or other debt financing source.\n4. Legally Compelled Disclosure.\nIf you or any of your Representatives are required, requested or compelled in any judicial, governmental, administrative or other legal proceeding, or pursuant to subpoena, civil investigative demand or other compulsory process to disclose any Evaluation Material or any Transaction Information, you and such Representative shall first provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such requirement, request or compulsory demand, to the extent you or such Representatives may legally do so, so that the Company may seek, at the Company\u2019s sole expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and shall consult with the Company with respect to the Company or you or such Representative taking steps to seek to resist or narrow the scope of such required or requested disclosure. It in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Company, you or any of your Representatives determine, after consultation with and upon the advice of legal counsel, that you or any such Representative are legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material or Transaction Information to any tribunal or other public or governmental authority, or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, you and any such Representative may disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material or Transaction Information which you or any such Representative determine, after consultation with and upon the advice of legal counsel, is legally required to be disclosed; provided, that you or such Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material or Transaction Information so disclosed, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Company to obtain, at the Company\u2019s sole expense, an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Evaluation Material or Transaction Information by such tribunal or other public or governmental authority.\n5. Termination of Discussions at Any Time Return of Evaluation Material.\nAt any time upon the request of the Company for any reason, you shall (and will direct your Representatives to) promptly, and in any event no later than 10 days after receipt of the request, deliver to the Company, or at your option, destroy, all Evaluation Material (including all copies, extracts and other reproductions thereof, whether in paper, electronic or other form or media) furnished to you or your Representatives by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that you and your Representatives shall be entitled to retain one complete copy, in electronic archival storage form, of all Evaluation Material in accordance with document retention laws or regulations applicable to you and to such other persons, as the case may be, but only to the extent that appropriate personnel whose primary function within your organization and within the organizations of such other persons, as the case may be, is information technology or compliance in nature will have unrestricted access to such retained information; and provided, further, however, that your legal counsel will be entitled to retain one complete copy of Evaluation Material in paper format as may be necessary to document your consideration of a Transaction for the purpose of establishing compliance with any applicable Non-Disclosure Agreement Page 4\nlaws or regulations and for defending and maintaining any litigation (or any arbitral or administrative case or proceeding) relating to this Agreement or the Evaluation Material; provided, that all such information shall continue to be kept confidential and shall be stored only in counsel\u2019s record archives to which access is not made generally available. The destruction of the Evaluation Material, including that prepared by you or your Representatives, shall be certified in writing to the Company by an authorized representative supervising such destruction. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you and your Representatives shall continue to be bound by your and their confidentiality obligations hereunder.\n6. Privileged Information.\nThe furnishing to you or your Representatives of any Evaluation Material shall not be deemed to waive or in any manner diminish any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other privilege or protection applicable to any such Evaluation Material. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in connection with your consideration of the potential Transaction only and not for any other purpose, they (a) are or may become joint defendants in legal proceedings to which such Evaluation Material relates, and (b) intend that all such privileges and protections shall remain intact should either party become subject to any legal proceedings to which such Evaluation Material is relevant. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees not to claim or contend that the other party has waived any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other protection or privilege by providing information pursuant to this Agreement or any subsequent agreement (definitive or otherwise) regarding a Transaction into which the parties hereafter may enter.\n7. No Representation or Warranty as to Accuracy and Completeness of Evaluation Material.\nThe Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine what information it will provide or withhold (and, if provided, the form thereof), as well as the times and locations at which it elects to make such information available. Neither the Company nor any of its Representatives has made, hereby makes or will make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the Evaluation Material, except as may be provided in a written definitive agreement between the parties.

You also acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of any Evaluation Material and that you shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations or warranties of the Company as may be made in a definitive agreement, if any, relating to a Transaction, when, as and if, entered into by the parties hereto and thereto and subject to such qualifications, limitations and restrictions as may be expressly specified therein.\n8. Standstill.\nYou agree that for a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the date hereof (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), neither you nor any of your affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall:\n(a) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, whether by means of purchase or otherwise, any (i) securities (or any interest therein or right thereto) having statutory, organic or contractual voting power, whether or not contingent or upon exercise, conversion or exchange (\u201cVoting Securities\u201d), of the Company or (ii) assets or businesses of the Company or of any division or operating unit of the Company;\n(b) enter into any contract, arrangement, understanding, plan, agreement or commitment (whether oral or written) with respect to any Derivative Securities (as defined below);\n(c) make or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d or \u201cconsents\u201d (as such terms are used in the rules and published interpretations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d)) to vote (or to withhold authority in respect of or abstain from voting), or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of (or the withholding of authority of or abstention from voting), any Voting Securities of the Company;\n(d) unless expressly invited to do so by the Board of Directors of Vocus (or any duly constituted committee thereof comprised wholly of independent directors of Vocus), make any public announcement with respect to, or submit to the Company or any of its affiliates, Representatives or any other person, any proposal, expression of interest, term sheet, memorandum of understanding, letter of intent, inquiry or offer (with or without conditions) providing for, in a single transaction or in any series of related transactions, any merger, consolidation, acquisition, business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, reorganization, divestiture, spin-off, split-off, cash or property distribution or any other extraordinary transaction involving the Company or any of the Company\u2019s securities, assets or businesses;\n(e) form, join or in any way engage or participate in a \u201cgroup,\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) in connection with any Voting Securities of the Company;\n(f) act alone, or in concert with any other person(s), to seek to control or influence the management, board of directors, policies or affairs of the Company (including, without limitation, by seeking to place any individual on the Company\u2019s board of directors, seeking to have called any meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders or seeking to advise, encourage or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company for the election of individuals to the Company\u2019s board of directors or to approve stockholder proposals);\n(g) take any action that might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause \u201c(a)\u201d or \u201c(d)\u201d of this sentence;\n(h) request or propose that the Company or any of the Company\u2019s Representatives amend or waive, or consider the amendment or waiver of, any provision set forth in this Section 8, either publicly or in any manner that would reasonably likely to lead to or require public disclosure of such request or proposal;\n(i) have any discussions or enter into any arrangements, understandings, plans, commitments or agreements (whether oral or written) with, act as a financing source for or otherwise invest in any significant manner with respect to, or advise, assist or encourage, any person in connection with any of the foregoing; or\n(j) at no time offer or communicate directly to the Company\u2019s shareholders in the form of a tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise in relation to the Transaction, unless expressly contemplated by a definitive agreement entered into between you (or one or more of your controlled affiliates) and the Company;\nprovided, however, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 8 shall terminate immediately upon (A) the public announcement by Vocus that it has entered into a definitive agreement with a third party for a transaction involving the acquisition of more than 50% of the outstanding equity securities of Vocus or all or substantially all of the assets (on a consolidated basis) of the Company or (B) any person or group publicly announces or commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire Voting Securities of Vocus, that, if successful, would result in such person or group beneficially owning more than 50% of the then outstanding Voting Securities of Vocus, and Vocus files a Schedule 14D-9 with respect to such tender or exchange offer that recommends that Vocus\u2019 stockholders accept such offer. The expiration of the Standstill Period will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement.\nFor purposes of this Section 8, \u201cDerivative Securities\u201d means any securities that are the subject of any derivative or other transaction entered into by any person, which gives such person the economic equivalent of ownership of an amount of Company securities due to the fact that the value of the derivative is determined by reference or in relation to the price or value of such securities, irrespective of whether (i) such derivative conveys or confers to any person, or otherwise has ascribed to it, any voting rights or voting power or (ii) the derivative is capable of being or required to be settled by the payment of cash or through the delivery of such securities.\n9. Effect of Agreement.\nNo agreement providing for any Transaction currently exists and none shall be deemed to exist between the parties hereto unless and until a definitive written agreement for any such Transaction is hereafter negotiated, executed and delivered with the intention of being legally binding upon the parties hereto and any other necessary parties thereto. The parties hereto agree that unless and until a definitive agreement between them with respect to a Transaction has been executed and delivered by them and any such other parties, with the intention of being legally binding as aforesaid, neither party nor any of their respective affiliates shall be under any obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction, including any obligation to commence or continue discussions or negotiations with respect to a Transaction, by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such a Transaction by the parties hereto or any of their Representatives. Without limiting the foregoing sentence (and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement), each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the other party hereto may disclose information about itself (if disclosed by you or your Representatives, to the extent not containing any Transaction Information or Evaluation Material, and if disclosed by the Company or its Representatives, to the extent not containing any Transaction Information) to, and enter into negotiations with, other persons or entities at any time without any obligation to notify the other party hereto of such disclosure or negotiations.\n10.

The contact person for the Company is: Jason Stack (jstack@stifel.com or 212-271-3868) or otherwise as directed in writing by the Company.\n11. Non-Solicitation.\nYou agree that, except as provided in a definitive agreement relating to a Transaction, for a period of one (1) year following the date of this Agreement, you shall not, and you shall not authorize, instruct, encourage or facilitate the ability of any of your Representatives and any person acting on behalf of to, in any manner, directly or indirectly, solicit for hire any of the officers or employees of the Company with whom you had contact or first became aware of during the process contemplated herein; provided, however, that the foregoing does not preclude you or your Representatives from: (a) soliciting employees through, or hiring employees who respond to, general job advertisements or similar notices that are not targeted specifically at the employees of the Company; or (b) soliciting or hiring employees whose employment has been terminated by the Company.\n12.

Remedies.\nThe Company and you each hereby acknowledge and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for breach of this Agreement by you or any of your Representatives or for breach of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Representatives and that therefore, both the Company and you shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctions and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach without necessity of posting any bond or other security, and without proof of any actual damages. Such remedies shall nonetheless not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, and shall be in addition to all other remedies available to you and to the Company at law or equity. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n14.

Other Terms.\n(a) Waivers and Amendments. No failure or delay by any party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement may only be amended by the execution and delivery of a written agreement to which you and the Company are signatories.\n(b) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal procedural and substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to the conflict of law principles of that state.\n(c) Consent to Jurisdiction.

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that they have both participated in the negotiations and preparation of this Agreement.

Purpose. The parties wish to engage in discussions regarding exploration of a business opportunity of mutual interest (\u201cAuthorized Purpose\u201d) and in connection with this Authorized Purpose, each party may disclose to the other certain confidential technical and business information which Owner desires Recipient to treat as confidential. The party disclosing Confidential Information is referred to herein as the \u201cOwner\u201d and the party receiving Confidential Information is referred to herein as the \u201cRecipient\u201d.\n2. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information (including without limitation documents, computer data, or oral communications) disclosed by either party to the other party, either directly or indirectly, that is identified as confidential or other similar designation at the time of disclosure or is known or should reasonably be known by the Recipient to be confidential in nature. The existence and subject matter of the parties\u2019 discussions shall be treated as Confidential Information. Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to Owner by third parties. Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by Owner; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by Owner to Recipient through no action or inaction of Recipient; (iii) is already in the possession of Recipient at the time of disclosure by Owner as shown by Recipient\u2019s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (iv) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without a breach of such third party\u2019s obligations of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Owner\u2019s Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in Recipient\u2019s possession.\n3. Legally Compelled Disclosure. If Recipient is required to disclose Owner\u2019s Confidential Information pursuant to a valid order by a court or other governmental body or as otherwise required by law, prior to any such compelled disclosure, Recipient will (i) notify Owner of the legal process, and allow Owner to assert the privileged and confidential nature of the Confidential Information against the third party seeking disclosure and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Owner in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure and/or use of the Confidential Information. If such protection against disclosure is not obtained, Recipient will be entitled to disclose the Confidential Information, but only as and to the extent necessary to legally comply with such compelled disclosure.\n4. Non-use and Non-disclosure. Each party agrees to use any Confidential Information of the other party solely for the Authorized Purpose and not for any third party\u2019s benefit. Each party agrees to limit disclosures of Confidential Information of the other party to those employees and agents of Recipient who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions regarding the Authorized Purpose. Each party agrees that it will not disclose any of the Confidential Information to any third party without the express written consent of Owner. Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any of the Confidential Information of the other party or any of the prototypes, software or other tangible objects which embody the Confidential Information of the other party and which are provided to the party hereunder. Certain Confidential Information may be considered material non-public information under Regulation FD promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Recipient acknowledges that the United States securities laws prohibit it or any person who has received material nonpublic information about the Owner from purchasing or selling securities of the Owner or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance on such information, and agrees not to purchase, sell or otherwise engage in transactions in Owner\u2019s stock based on such material nonpublic information until such time as the information becomes disseminated to the public either through a press release issued by Owner or through a filing made by Owner pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; provided, however, that Recipient may make any disclosure or use of such information to which Owner gives its prior written consent.\n5. Maintenance of Confidentiality. Each party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party. Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential information and shall ensure that its employees and agents who have access to Confidential Information of the other party are subject to confidentiality obligations similar in scope and nature to the provisions hereof, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees or agents. Each party shall reproduce the other party\u2019s proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.\n6. No Obligation. Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.\n7. No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d. EACH PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, OR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n8. Return of Materials.

(\u201cCOMPANY\u201d) and Comsys IT Partners, Inc. (\u201cCOMSYS\u201d), collectively the \u201cParties,\u201d certain information may be requested by both COMPANY and COMSYS relating to the other party or the Transaction and the Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement. All such information (whether written or oral) furnished (whether before, on or after the date hereof) by either company, or its directors, officers, employees, representatives (including, without limitation, financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, consultants and accountants) or agents (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) to the other party and all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents prepared by the Parties or their Representatives in connection with their review of, or their interest in, the Transaction which contain, reflect, are generated from or are based upon, in whole or in part, any such information is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cInformation.\u201d The term Information will not, however, include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving Party or its Representatives that is prohibited by this Agreement; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis from a source which, to the best of its knowledge, is not known to be prohibited from disclosing such information to the receiving Party by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to either Party; (iii) was in possession of the receiving Party prior to the disclosure of the information pursuant to this Agreement, provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving Party, after due inquiry, to be subject to an obligation not to disclose such information; or (iv) is independently developed without reference to or use of the Information.\nAccordingly, the Parties hereby agree that:\n1. The Parties and their Representatives (i) will keep the Information strictly confidential and will not (except as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process, and only after compliance with paragraph 2 below), without the prior written consent of the other party, disclose any Information in any manner whatsoever, and (ii) will not use any Information other than in connection with the Transaction; provided, however, that the Parties may reveal the Information to their Representatives (a) who need to know the Information for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction, (b) who are informed by the Parties of the confidential nature of the Information and are provided with a copy of this Agreement, (c) who agree not to disclose any of the Information to any other party and (d) who agree to act in accordance with the terms of this letter agreement to the same extent as if they were parties hereto. The Parties will cause their Representatives to observe the terms of this letter agreement, and they will be responsible for any breach of this agreement by any of their Representatives.\n2. In the event that the Parties or any of their Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law, regulation, rules of any national stock exchange, or legal process to disclose any of the Information, the Parties must notify each other promptly so that they may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the sole discretion of the party that initially furnished such Information, waive compliance with the terms of this letter agreement. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Parties waive compliance with the terms of this letter agreement, the Parties will furnish only that portion of the Information which they are advised by counsel is legally required and will exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Information.\n3. If COMPANY or COMSYS determines not to proceed with the Transaction, they will promptly inform the other Party of that decision and, in that case, and at any time upon request of COMPANY or COMSYS or any of their Representatives, the other party will either (i) promptly destroy all copies of the written Information in its or its Representatives\u2019 possession and confirm such destruction to the initiating company in writing or (ii) promptly deliver to the initiator of such action all copies of the written Information in its or its Representatives\u2019 possession. Any oral Information will continue to be subject to the terms of this letter agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing to the contrary, either Party may retain in the files of its legal counsel such documents and records as are required to be maintained in order to satisfy any law, rule, or regulation to which the Party is subject or for the purpose of determining its continuing obligations under this Agreement, including any rule of any national stock exchange. Furthermore, if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered.\n4. Neither Party hereto shall in any way or in any form disclose, publicize or advertise in any manner the discussions that give rise to this Agreement or the discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement, including the fact that any such discussions have taken or are taking place, or any proposal relating thereto, including the terms and conditions thereof, without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n Notwithstanding any term or implication herein to the contrary, either Party may disclose Information and any of the information described in the preceding paragraph to the extent such Party determines in good faith upon advice of counsel that such disclosure is required in connection with such Party\u2019s disclosure responsibilities under the securities laws (including regulations, rules and interpretations promulgated or issued by a regulatory body), so long as such Party gives the other party such prior notice of such disclosure, and such opportunity to review, comment on, and lawfully limit the proposed disclosure, as is reasonably available under the circumstances.\n5. The Parties hereby acknowledge that, unless and until a definitive agreement between COMPANY and COMSYS with respect to any Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither the COMPANY nor COMSYS will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Transaction and hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with any Transaction. In addition, neither Party will be under any obligation to negotiate a definitive agreement, by virtue of this or any written or oral expression, discussion or negotiation with respect to such Transaction by any or either of the Representatives of the Parties except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.\n6. The Parties hereby agree that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, the breaching party agrees that the non-breaching party may be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance. Such remedy may not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for the breach of this Agreement but may be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the non-breaching party. In the event that the non-breaching party successfully enforces the obligations of the breaching party hereunder, the breaching party shall reimburse the non-breaching party for all reasonable costs and expenses, including legal counsel, incurred by the non-breaching party in this regard.\n7. Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Information and receiving Party agrees that disclosing Party and its employees and agents shall have no liability to receiving Party resulting from any use of the Information.\n8. COMPANY agrees that, for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of this Agreement, unless COMPANY shall have been specifically invited in writing by COMSYS, neither COMPANY nor its Representatives as advisor to COMPANY as principal will in any manner, directly or indirectly: (a) effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in or in any way assist any other person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, (i) any acquisition of any securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) or assets of COMSYS or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving COMSYS or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to COMSYS or any of its subsidiaries, or (iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the other Party; (b) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in the Securities Act of 1934) with respect to the securities of COMSYS; (c) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence management or the board of directors or policies of COMSYS; (d) take any action which might force COMSYS to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above; or (e) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that if COMSYS makes a public announcement that it has entered into a definitive agreement that contemplates a business combination transaction between COMSYS and a third party that would result in a change of control of COMSYS, or in the event any third party has made a tender offer for a majority of the then outstanding securities of COMSYS entitled to be voted generally in the election of directors, then COMPANY may make a proposal to the board of directors of COMSYS with respect to a business combination transaction involving COMPANY and COMSYS.\n9. The Parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that any provision or portion of this letter agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n The Parties further acknowledge that such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be substituted with a provision as similar in intent and economic effect to such provision as may be possible and yet be valid, legal and enforceable.\n10. The Parties hereby acknowledge that neither the failure nor delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege existing in connection with this Agreement shall operate or be construed to be a waiver of such right, power or privilege. No single or partial exercise thereof will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder or otherwise legally available. No waiver hereunder shall be considered valid or enforceable, except by a written agreement signed by the Parties and no such waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent instance or circumstance of the same or similar nature.\n11. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the Parties and supersedes any and all other agreements, if any, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains all of the covenants and agreements between the Parties with respect thereto. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Parties and supersedes all prior collateral communications, if any, regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall govern all communications between the Parties that are made during the period from the effective date of this Agreement to the date on which either party receives from the other written notice that subsequent communications shall not be so governed. No modification or amendment of this Agreement and no waiver of the terms and conditions hereof, in whole or in part, shall be binding, except by a written agreement signed by the Parties.\n12. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and will be binding upon the Parties and their respective Representatives, successors and permitted assigns.\n13. The validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement, its construction and the rights, remedies and obligations arising by, under, through or on account of it, shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof. The Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the sole and exclusive venue and jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and hereby agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding related thereto except in such courts.\n14.

(\u201cCaptaris\u201d), Captaris will make available to Vector certain confidential and proprietary information concerning its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities. As a condition to such information being made available to Vector and Vector\u2019s potential financing sources and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), Vector agrees to treat any information concerning Captaris (whether prepared by Captaris, its advisors or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication) which is furnished pursuant to this letter agreement to Vector or to its Representatives now or in the future by or on behalf of Captaris (such information herein collectively referred to as the \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d) in accordance with the provisions of this letter agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions hereinafter set forth. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this letter agreement shall be broadly interpreted to including the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\nThe term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d also shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by Vector or its Representatives to the extent they contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to Vector or its Representatives pursuant hereto. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Vector or its Representatives in contravention of this agreement, (ii) was within Vector\u2019s possession prior to its being furnished to Vector by or on behalf of Captaris pursuant hereto, provided that the source of such information was not known by Vector to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to Captaris or any other party with respect to such information; (iii) becomes available to Vector on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Captaris or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by Vector to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to Captaris or any other party with respect to such information; or (iv) is independently developed by Vector without the use of any Evaluation Material and without any other violation of this agreement.\nVector hereby agrees that it and its Representatives shall use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the parties, that the\nEvaluation Material will be kept confidential and that Vector and its Representatives will not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) Vector may make any disclosure of such information to which Captaris gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of such information may be disclosed by Vector to its Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating and implementing a possible transaction between the parties, who shall keep such information confidential and who are provided with a copy of this letter agreement. In any event, Vector shall be responsible for any breach of this letter agreement by any of its Representatives, and Vector agrees, at its sole expense, to take reasonable measures (including but not limited to court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from disclosure or use of the Evaluation Material in contravention of this agreement.\nIn addition, except as required by law or any rule of any self-regulatory organization, each of Captaris and Vector agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, it and its Representatives will not disclose to any other person the fact that the Evaluation Material has been exchanged, that discussions or negotiations are or may be taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof) unless such first party has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure is required in order to avoid a violation of law or any rule of any self-regulatory organization.\nIn the event that (i) Vector or any of its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process or law or any rule of any self-regulatory organization) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material furnished by Captaris or (ii) Vector or any of its Representative or Captaris or any of its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process or law or any rule of any self-regulatory organization) to disclose any of the information described in the preceding paragraph (the \u201cOther Confidential Information\u201d)), then Vector or Captaris, as applicable (the \u201cDisclosure Party\u201d) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, provide Captaris or Vector, as applicable (the \u201cOther Party\u201d) with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Other Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this letter agreement. If, in the absence of any protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Other Party, the Disclosure Party or any of its Representatives determines in good faith, after consultation with the Disclosure Party\u2019s outside counsel or such Representative\u2019s counsel, as applicable, that it is legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material (or any of the Other Confidential Information), the Disclosure Party or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material or Other Confidential Information that it determines in good faith, after consultation with such counsel, it is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Disclosure Party exercise commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the Other Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Other Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Evaluation Material and the Other Confidential Information.\nIf either party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a transaction, it will promptly inform the other party of that decision. In that case, or any time upon the request of a party for any reason, Vector will promptly, at Vector\u2019s option (i) return to Captaris and/or (ii) destroy all Evaluation Material (and all tangible copies thereof) furnished to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of the other party pursuant hereto, and in either case no copies thereof shall be retained except that, any of the foregoing notwithstanding, that portion of the Evaluation Material that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies, or other documents prepared by Vector\u2019s Representatives, such Representatives\u2019 agents, attorneys or employees, and oral or electronic Evaluation Material will be held by such Representatives and kept subject to the terms of this agreement or destroyed to the extent practicable and permitted by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) financial advisors to the parties may retain copies of the Evaluation Material and Other Confidential Information (including Evaluation Material and Other Confidential Information) stored on electronic, magnetic or similar media) in accordance with policies and procedures implemented in order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements and to demonstrate such financial advisor\u2019s compliance with its obligations, and (ii) Representatives that are accounting firms may retain copies of the Evaluation Material in accordance with policies and procedures implemented by such persons in order to comply with applicable law, regulation, professional standards or reasonable business practice, and furthermore our Representatives that are accounting firms may disclose Evaluation Material to the extent required by law, rule, regulation or applicable professional standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or state boards of accountancy or obligations thereunder.\nVector understands and acknowledges that, except pursuant to a final definitive agreement regarding any transactions contemplated hereby, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, (i) neither Captaris nor any of\u2019 its Representatives make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, (ii) neither Captaris nor its Representatives shall have any liability to Vector or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, and (iii) only those representations or warranties which are made in any such final definitive agreement will have any legal effect.\nCaptaris agrees that, for a period ending eight weeks after the date of this letter agreement, it will afford Vector and its Representatives, reasonable access to the information described in Exhibit A and the books, contracts, commitments and records of Captaris and its subsidiaries relevant thereto, unless and until Vector and Captaris have reached a non-binding consensus regarding basic deal terms, at which time access will broaden to include all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of Captaris and its Subsidiaries as Vector may reasonably request and that is in the possession or control of Captaris.\nIn consideration of the Evaluation Material being furnished by Captaris hereunder, Vector hereby agrees that, for a period of twelve months from the date hereof, it will not, and will not encourage or assist its affiliates to, solicit for employment (a) any officers or other senior key employees of Captaris or any of its business units so long as they are employed by the Captaris or its business units, without obtaining the prior written consent of Captaris, and (b) any of the other employees of Captaris or any of its business units with whom Vector has had contact or who Vector first became aware of during the period of its investigation of Captaris, so long as they are employed by the Captaris or its business units, without obtaining the prior written consent of Captaris. Nothing in the foregoing clause (b) shall preclude Vector from hiring any person who (i) initiates discussions with Vector regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by Vector, (ii) has ceased to be employed by Captaris prior to commencement of direct or indirect employment discussions between Vector and such person, or (iii) responds to any general solicitation placed by Vector or any recruitment agency on Vector\u2019s behalf.\nVector agrees that, for a period (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d) ending on the earliest of (i) six months from the date of this agreement and (ii) the occurrence of a \u201cSignificant Event\u201d (as defined below), unless it shall have been specifically invited in writing by Captaris, neither Vector nor any of its affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)) will in any manner, directly or indirectly, (a) effect or publicly seek, offer or propose to effect, or cause or participate in or in any way assist any other person to effect or publicly seek, offer or propose to effect or participate in, (i) any acquisition of 5% or more of the securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) or consolidated assets (including securities of subsidiaries) of Captaris; (ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving Captaris or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to Captaris or any of its subsidiaries; or (iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of Captaris; (b) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under the 1934 Act) the purpose of which is to effect a transaction described in (a) above; (c) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to publicly seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of Captaris; or (d) take any action which would reasonably be expected to force Captaris to make a public announcement regarding any of\u2019 the types of matters set forth in (a) above; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, actions otherwise prohibited by clause (a)(iv) above shall be permitted hereunder on the date thirty days prior to the last day on which shareholders may properly nominate directors for election at, and properly bring (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not by means of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act) other business to be transacted at, Captaris\u2019s 2008 annual meeting of shareholders if such date occurs earlier than the expiration of the Standstill Period as a result of (x) the date of such meeting being advanced to be more than 30 days prior to the anniversary of Captaris\u2019s 2007 annual meeting of shareholders and/or (y) an amendment to Captaris\u2019s Amended and Restated Bylaws. For purposes of this agreement, (i) \u201dSignificant Event\u201d shall mean (A) the entry by Captaris into an agreement providing for, or the board of directors of Captaris otherwise recommending to the stockholders of Captaris, any merger, sale, stock issuance or other business combination transaction pursuant to which the outstanding shares of Captaris common stock would be converted into cash or securities of another person or 13D Group, or 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of Captaris common stock would be owned by persons other than the then current holders of shares of Captaris common stock, or which would result in all or a substantial portion of Captaris\u2019s assets being sold to any person or 13D Group, or the outstanding shares of Captaris common stock immediately prior to any such transaction would constitute less than 80% of the outstanding shares of Captaris common stock immediately after such transaction, or (B) an unsolicited bona fide tender offer or exchange offer is made by any person or 13D Group to acquire securities of Captaris which would (when added to shares already owned by such person or 13D Group) represent 20% or more of the then outstanding shares of Captaris common stock; (ii) \u201dVoting Securities\u201d shall mean shares of any class of Captaris capital stock which are then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; provided, that for purposes of this definition any securities which at such time are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Captaris common stock shall be deemed to have been so converted, exchanged or exercised; and (iii) \u201d13D Group\u201d shall mean, with respect to Captaris Voting Securities, any group of persons formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of Captaris Voting Securities, which would require under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the filing of a statement on Schedule 13D with the SEC as a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, if such group beneficially owned Captaris Voting Securities representing more than 5% of the total combined voting power of all Captaris Voting Securities then outstanding.\nThe parties understand and agree that no contract or agreement providing for any transaction between them shall be deemed to exist unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, and each party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with any transaction involving the other party unless and until both parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement. Each party also agrees that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a transaction between the parties has been executed and delivered, neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this letter agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the other party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals with regard to a transaction between the parties, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. Vector further understands that (i) Captaris and its Representatives shall be free to conduct any process for any transaction involving Captaris, if and as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to Vector or any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such process or transaction may be changed at any time without notice to Vector or any other person, and (iii) Vector shall not have any claims whatsoever against Captaris, its Representatives or any of their respective directors, officers, stockholders, owners, affiliates or agents arising out of or relating to any transaction involving Captaris (other than those as against the parties to a definitive agreement with Vector in accordance with the terms thereof) nor, unless a definitive agreement is entered into with Vector, against any third party with whom a transaction is entered into.\nIt is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\nIt is further understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this letter agreement by either party or any of its Representatives and that the parties shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this letter agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. In the event of litigation relating to this letter agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable order that a party has breached this letter agreement, then such party shall be liable and pay to the non-breaching party the reasonable legal fees incurred by such non-breaching party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom. This letter agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their respective directors, officers, stockholders, owners, affiliates, and agents, and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\nThis letter agreement will terminate on the second anniversary of the date of this agreement.\nPlease confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning one copy of this letter to the undersigned, whereupon this letter agreement shall become a binding agreement between Vector and Captaris.\nVery truly yours,\nCaptaris, Inc.\nBy: /s/ David P.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kennedy may own, directly, or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any Person traded on any national securities exchange if Kennedy is not a controlling Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not, directly or indirectly, own five percent (5%) or more of any class of securities of such Person.\n(b) During the Restricted Period, Kennedy shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of the Company or encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire any such employee who has left such employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such employees; provided, that nothing in this Section 1 shall prevent Kennedy or any of his Affiliates from hiring (i) any employee whose employment has been terminated by the Company before the Merger, (ii) any employee whose employment has been terminated by the Company after the Merger one-hundred eighty (180) days from the date of termination of employment; or (iii) Jesse Miramontes (a current employee of the Company) and any Kennedy family member (including, without limitation, Nancy Kennedy (wife) or John C.

The covenants contained in this Section and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.\n(f) If Kennedy violates any of the provisions of this Section 1, the computation of the time period provided in this Section 1 shall be tolled from the first date of the breach until (i) the date judicial relief is obtained by the Company, (ii) the Company states in writing that it will seek no judicial relief for said violation, or (iii) Kennedy provides satisfactory evidence to the Company that such breach has been terminated.\n2.

Necessity of Covenants; Injunctive Relief. Kennedy acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm to the Company, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Kennedy of any such obligations, the Company shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction.\n5.

"      ""text"": ""CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\n June 12, 2003\nGenzme Corporation\nOne Kendal Square Cambridge, MA 02139\n In connection with your consideration of a possible business combination transaction (a \""Transaction\"") with SangStat Medical Corporation, we expect to make available to one another certain nonpublic information concerning our respective business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, including, without limitation, technical information and information regarding intellectual property rights. As a condition to such information being furnished to each party and its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, \""Representatives\""), each party agrees to treat any nonpublic information concerning to other party (whether prepared by the disclosing party, its advisors or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication) which is furnished hereunder to a party or to its Representatives now or in the future by or on behalf of the disclosing party (herein collectively referred to as the \""Evaluation Material\"") in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n (1) Evaluation Material. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" also shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents (whether in paper, electronic or any other form) prepared by each or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to such party or its Representatives pursuant hereto which is not available to the general public and would otherwise constitute Evaluation Material hereunder. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party or its Representatives, (ii) was within the receiving party's possession prior to its being furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the disclosing party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving party to the bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information, (iv) is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without a duty of confidentiality, (v) is independently developed by the receiving party or any of its Representatives without use of Evaluation Material and can be proved by competent evidence, (vi) is disclosed under operation of applicable law or regulation, or (vii) is disclosed by the receiving party or its Representatives with the discloser's prior written approval.\n (2) Purpose of Disclosure of Evaluation Material. It is understood and agreed to by each party that any exchange of information under this Agreement shall be solely for the purposes of evaluating a possible Transaction between the parties and, if the parties determine to proceed with a Transaction, the negotiation, execution and performance of a definitive agreement with respect thereto and not to affect, in any way, each party's relative competitive position to each party or to other entities. It is further agreed, that the information to be disclosed to each other shall only be that information which is reasonably necessary to a Transaction and that information which is not reasonably necessary for such purposes shall not be disclosed or exchanged. For purposes of determining when information is reasonably necessary for such purpose, legal counsel to each party shall agree, in advance, to review information requests so as to comply with such standard.\n (3) Use of Evaluation Material. Each party hereby agrees that it and its Representatives shall use the other's Evaluation Material solely for the purposes of evaluating a possible Transaction between the parties and, if the parties determine to proceed with a Transaction, the negotiation, execution and performance of a definitive agreement with respect thereto, and that the disclosing party's Evaluation\nMaterial will be kept confidential and each party and its Representatives will not disclose or use for purposes other than the purposes stated above any of the other's Evaluation Material in any other manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) the receiving party may make any disclosure of such information to which the disclosing party gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of such information may be disclosed to the receiving party's Representatives which need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction between the parties, who are informed of the confidential nature of such information and are subject to confidentiality and non-use obligations at least as restrictive as defined herein. Each party is aware of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who have received material, nonpublic information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.\n (4) Non-Disclosure. Subject to the above, each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person the fact that any Evaluation Material has been made available hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including that status thereof) provided, that a party may make such disclosure if such party determines,with the advice of counsel, that such disclosure is required by applicable law or regulation or under any listing agreement with respect to such party's securities. In such event, the disclosing party shall use its best efforts to give prompt advance written notice to the other party to the extent practicable under the circumstances.\n (5) Required Disclosure. In the event that a party or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the other party's Evaluation Material, the party requested or required to make the disclosure shall provide the other party with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by such other party, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose the other party's Evaluation Material to any tribunal, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the other party's Evaluation Material which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the party requested or required to make the disclosure exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the other party's Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, by reasonably cooperating with the other party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the other party's Evaluation Material by such tribunal.\n (6) Termination of Discussions. If either party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Transaction with the other party, the party so deciding will inform the other party of that decision. In that case, or at any time upon the written request of either disclosing party for any reason, each receiving party will promptly deliver to the disclosing party or destroy all Evaluation Material that was furnished to the receiving party or its Representatives by or on behalf of the disclosing party, by whichever method requested by the disclosing party, pursuant hereto. In the event of such a decision for request, all other copies, extracts and summaries of the disclosing party's Evaluation Material prepared by the receiving party shall be destroyed and, except as provided herein, no copy thereof shall be retained. In no event shall the receiving party be obligated to disclose or provide the copies, extracts and summaries of the disclosing party's Evaluation Material prepared by it or its Representatives to the disclosing party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party may retain one (1) copy of the disclosing party's Evaluation Material solely for purposes of monitoring its compliance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the return or distruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n (7) No representation of Accuracy. Each party understands and acknowledges that neither party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material make available by it or to it. Each party agrees that neither party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the other party or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of or reliance upon such other party's Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding the Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n (8) Standstill.

"      ""text"": ""Exhibit (d)(2)\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis AGREEMENT is effective as of January 12, 2015 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d) by and between Pitney Bowes Inc., a company having a place of business at 3001 Summer Street, Stamford, CT 06905 (together with its subsidiaries and other affiliates, \u201cPBI\u201d), and Borderfree, Inc., a company having a place of business at 292 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10017 (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates \u201cBorderfree\u201d).\nThe parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. PBI and Borderfree each have an interest in exploring a possible negotiated business transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) relating to the potential acquisition of Borderfree (the \u201cBusiness\u201d). To explore the Transaction, it may be necessary for each party to disclose certain Confidential Information to the other party. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any information disclosed or provided to one party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) on or after the Effective Date by or on behalf of the other party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), which the Disclosing Party has not released publicly and which the Disclosing Party considers confidential and/or in which the Disclosing Party has a proprietary interest. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, information, know-how, specifications, materials, models, plans, discoveries, trade secrets (as such term is defined in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act in effect on the Effective Date), records, data, business, marketing, manufacturing and financial records, operations and strategies, invention plans, distribution channels, and technical and product information, customer data, product services, information of the Disclosing Party\u2019s subsidiaries and entities under its control and other communications concerning the Transaction and/or the Disclosing Party\u2019s business and operations, together with all portions of analyses, compilations, notes, studies and other documents prepared by or for the benefit of the Receiving Party which contain or otherwise reflect any of the foregoing.

All information not meeting the requirements of this Section shall be considered non-confidential.\n2. For a period of three (3) years from the date of initial disclosure, Confidential Information received by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party hereunder shall be: (a) held in confidence by the Receiving Party and not disclosed to any third party; and (b) used by the Receiving Party only for the purpose of evaluating and completing the Transaction. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information on a need to know basis to its and its affiliates\u2019 officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, investment banks, the agents and lenders under the Receiving Party\u2019s existing credit facilities, attorneys and accountants) (\u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who have a need to know such information for purposes of evaluation and completion of the Transaction; provided that such Representatives shall be bound by terms of confidentiality and non-use consistent with those set forth in this Agreement. Each party will direct its Representatives not to disclose to any other person either: (a) the fact that the Confidential Information exists or has been made available to the Receiving Party, (b) that the parties are considering the Transaction, or (c) that discussions or negotiations are taking place or have taken place between the parties concerning the Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts relating to the Transaction with the Receiving Party or such discussions or negotiations, including the status thereof or the subject matter of this Agreement (the matters described in the foregoing clauses (a)-(c) being referred to herein as \u201cTransaction Information\u201d). Each party agrees to be responsible for any breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement by any of its Representatives (it being understood that such responsibility shall be in addition to and not by way of limitation of any right or remedy a party may have against the other party\u2019s Representatives with respect to such breach).\n3. The term Confidential Information does not include any information which: (a) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement or other obligation of confidentiality, or (b) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party\non a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives) who is not known by the Receiving Party to be prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, or (c) is already in the Receiving Party\u2019s or its Representatives\u2019 possession (other than information furnished by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party), or (d) is independently developed by a party or any of its Representatives without violating any of such party\u2019s obligations hereunder or without reference to the Confidential Information.\n4. Unless otherwise agreed to by PBI in writing, and without limiting any communications permitted by the last sentence of Section 12, (a) all communications regarding the Transaction, (b) requests for additional information, (c) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (d) discussions or questions regarding procedures, timing and terms of the Transaction, will be submitted or directed exclusively to one or more members of the Pitney Bowes Corporate Development Department (the \u201cPBI Contacts\u201d).

Unless otherwise agreed to by Borderfree in writing, and without limiting any communications permitted by the last sentence of Section 12, (a) all communications regarding the Transaction, (b) requests for additional information, (c) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (d) discussions or questions regarding procedures, timing and terms of the Transaction, will be submitted or directed exclusively to any of the contacts at Borderfree included in Exhibit A to this Agreement (the \u201cBorderfree Contacts\u201d).\n5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement other than, and subject to, Section 12 of this Agreement, in the event the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives receives a request pursuant to or is required by law, rule, regulation, deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process or pursuant to a formal request from a regulatory examiner (any such requested or required disclosure, an \u201cExternal Demand\u201d) to disclose all or any part of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information or Transaction Information, the Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, agree to (to the extent practicable and legally permissible) (a) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such External Demand, (b) consult with the Disclosing Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request or disclosure, and (c) assist the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s expense, in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy to the extent available under the circumstances.

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall PBI be permitted to make any disclosure of Confidential Information in response to any External Demand that arises from an action taken by PBI in violation of Section 12 of this Agreement.\n6. Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party at all times. If the Receiving Party determines not to proceed with the Transaction, the Receiving Party will promptly inform the Disclosing Party of that decision and, in that case, upon the request of the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, the Receiving Party will: (a) destroy all copies of the written Confidential Information in the Receiving Party\u2019s possession (other than any of your own Analyses), and (b) promptly destroy all the Disclosing Party\u2019s Analyses; provided however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require the destruction of investment memoranda prepared by the Receiving Party in the ordinary course of business and retained in accordance with the Receiving Party\u2019s general retention policies or computer backup tapes or copies of Confidential Information or Analyses created pursuant to automated archiving or backup procedures; and provided further that the Receiving Party\u2019s records department may retain one copy of such Confidential Information, subject to the terms of this Agreement, solely for compliance with legal or regulatory obligations or pursuant to its internal document retention policies. The Receiving Party will certify such destruction to the Disclosing Party, in writing signed by one of the Receiving Party\u2019s authorized Representatives. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its and their obligations under this Agreement.\n7. Nothing herein shall obligate either party to disclose to or receive from the other party any particular information. Neither party has an obligation under this Agreement to purchase any service or item from the other party.

Unless and until a Definitive Agreement (as defined below) concerning the Transaction has been executed, neither party nor its affiliates nor its or its affiliates\u2019 Representatives shall have any legal obligation to the other party of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction, whether by virtue of this Agreement (except as expressly provided herein), any other written or oral expression with respect to the Transaction, or otherwise.\n8.

Nothing agreed to herein shall prevent either party from such activities; provided, however, that any Confidential Information received under this Agreement may be used only for the purpose of this Transaction and in no event shall be provided to any of such companies.\n9. Disclosure of any information under this Agreement shall not be construed as, directly or by implication, (a) granting any license under any United States or foreign patent, patent application or copyright, or any other intellectual property rights, (b) creating any agency or partnership relationship between the parties, or (c) granting the right to use either party\u2019s name, trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos or designs for any purpose, without the other party\u2019s prior written permission.\n10.

The Company agrees to notify Meru promptly of its determination not to proceed with its consideration of the possible Transaction (the date upon which such notification is provided to Meru is referenced herein as the \u201cNotification Date\u201d). The receiving party, upon the disclosing party\u2019s request, will promptly return all Confidential Information received from the disclosing party, together with all copies, or at the option of the receiving party, certify in writing that all such Confidential Information and copies thereof have been destroyed.

Neither party nor its respective Associates shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its respective employees or consultants as a result of their having had access to Confidential Information of the other party or its Associates, provided that such employees or consultants can and do perform their duties without recourse to Confidential Information of the other party and that such party shall not have selected such person to review Confidential Information because that person has an eidetic or other unusually strong memory. The receiving party may use any Residuals (as defined below) for any purpose, provided that this paragraph does not grant or imply any license or other right to use any patent, trademark, copyright, mask work right or other intellectual property right. \u201cResiduals\u201d means information in non-tangible form that is incidentally retained, as general knowledge and experience (and not through intentional memorization in any way), in the unaided memory of the receiving party\u2019s Associates that are natural persons who have had access to the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information within the scope of the receiving party\u2019s obligations under this agreement, but who no longer have access to such Confidential Information. The memory of an Associate of the receiving party thereof is unaided if such individual has not intentionally memorized the Confidential Information or retained notes or other aids to such memory.\n9.

The parties also agree that during such period any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence) will not be amended or waived without the prior written consent of both parties.

Non-Solicitation Period. The Company agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of this Agreement, it will not solicit and will not permit any of its Affiliates (in each case who is or becomes aware of the possible Transaction or is otherwise provided with Confidential Information) to solicit for employment any Specified Employee (as defined below); provided, however, that this Section 10 will not prevent the Company from (a) causing to be placed any general advertisement or similar notice that is not targeted specifically at employees of Meru or its subsidiaries, (b) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit persons for employment on their behalf and soliciting the employment of any Specified Employee who is identified by such recruiting firm or organization, so long as such recruiting firm or organization is not instructed to target or solicit any Specified Employee of Meru or its subsidiaries, or (c) engaging in employment discussions or hiring a Specified Employee if such Specified Employee initiates contact with the Company by clear and convincing evidence.

Only those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect. Neither party nor any of such party\u2019s Associates shall have any liability to the other party or its Associates relating to or arising from the use of or reliance upon any information or any errors or omissions therein. For purposes of this Section 11, \u201cinformation\u201d is deemed to include all information furnished by or on behalf of a party or its Associates to the other party or its Associates, regardless of whether such information constitutes \u201cConfidential Information\u201d as defined in Section 1. The parties expressly agree that neither the terms or conditions of this Agreement, nor any discussions held by the parties to address the feasibility of a potential business relationship or business opportunity shall be construed as to prevent either party from pursuing similar discussions with third parties in similar markets or obligate either party to take, continue or forgo any action relating to the above-mentioned discussions.\n12.

All modifications of, waivers of and amendments to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties hereto. No failure or delay by either party or any of its Associates in exercising any right, power or privilege under this agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege under this agreement.\n14. Captions. The underlined captions appearing in this agreement have been included only for convenience and shall not affect or be taken into account in the interpretation of this agreement.\n15. Severability.

All Evaluation Material that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n11.

Remedies.

"      ""text"": ""Exhibit (e)(3)\nMUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nZIPREALTY, INC.\nTHIS AGREEMENT is made as of April 25, 2014 by and between ZipRealty, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cZipRealty\u201d), and Realogy Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (\u201cCompany\u201d).\n1. Permitted Purpose. ZipRealty and Company wish to explore a potential business opportunity under which each party (the \u201cdisclosing party\u201d) may disclose its Confidential Information to the other party (the \u201creceiving party\u201d) solely for the purpose of that potential business opportunity (the \u201cPermitted Purpose\u201d).\n2. Definition of Confidential Information. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how of the disclosing party or its customers, vendors, business partners or investors that is provided to the recipient party by or on behalf of the disclosing party, either directly or indirectly, whether in writing, orally or by observation, including, but not limited to, research, products, services, product plans, clients, client lists, lead lists, markets, marketing, expansion plans, databases, software, developments, inventions, processes, technology, maskworks, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, finances, financial results or other business information, in each case which the disclosing party considers to be confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information does not include information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how that: (i) is in the possession of, or becomes available to, the receiving party on a non-confidential basis, as shown by the receiving party\u2019s files and records, and such information was received from a source not known by the receiving party to be bound by any obligation not to disclose the information, (ii) prior or after the time of disclosure becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving party, or (iii) is approved for release by the disclosing party in writing.\n3. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. ZipRealty and Company agree not to use the Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party for its own use or for any purpose except the Permitted Purpose. Neither party will disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties except those directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who need to have the information in order to carry out the Permitted Purpose. Each party has had or will have each of its Representatives who has access to Confidential Information of the other party agree to maintain the confidentiality thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In any event, each party will be liable for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. Each party agrees that it will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or nonpermitted use of Confidential Information of the other party in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other than those persons authorized hereunder to have any such information, which measures will include the highest degree of care that either party utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. Each party agrees to notify the other party in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of such Confidential Information that may come to its attention.\n4. Disclosure Required by Law. In the event that the receiving party or any of its Representatives is requested or required by legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party, the receiving party will, if legally permissible, give prompt written notice to the disclosing party so that the disclosing party may seek, at its expense, a protective order or other appropriate relief. In the event that such protective order is not obtained, the receiving party or its Representatives will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that, in the advice of its counsel, it is legally required to disclose.\n5. Return of Materials. Any materials or documents that have been furnished by or on behalf of the disclosing party to the receiving party or its Representatives will, promptly upon the disclosing party\u2019s request, at the receiving party\u2019s option, either (i) be returned to the disclosing party, and all copies of such documentation will be destroyed, or (ii) be destroyed (along with all copies of such documentation), such destruction to be certified in writing to the disclosing party.\n6. Information Provided As Is. Each disclosing party acknowledges that it has attempted in good faith to provide accurate information to the receiving party. Notwithstanding that attempt, the disclosing party makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, to the receiving party regarding, and the receiving party may not rely on, the completeness or accuracy of any information provided to the receiving party.\n7. No License Granted. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party or any of its Representatives under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right, nor does this Agreement grant either party or any of its Representatives any rights in or to the other party\u2019s information, except the limited right to use such information solely for the Permitted Purpose.\n8. No Trading on Inside Information. Company is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are provided any Confidential Information of ZipRealty, of the restrictions imposed by federal securities laws on the purchase or sale of ZipRealty\u2019s securities by any person who has received material non-public information from ZipRealty or its Representatives and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person may purchase or sell ZipRealty\u2019s securities while in possession of such information. Company agrees to require its Representatives to comply with these restrictions.\n9. Public Company Standstill. Unless previously approved by the Board of Directors of the disclosing party, each receiving party will not, and will instruct and use its best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:\n(a) inquire about, announce or make any offer or proposal (including, without limitation, any offer or proposal to the stockholders of the disclosing party) concerning an Acquisition Transaction (as defined below);\n(b) knowingly encourage, solicit or discuss with, or provide any Confidential Information of the disclosing party to, any person or entity with respect to any inquiry or announcement regarding or the making of any offer or proposal concerning any Acquisition Transaction;\n(c) otherwise knowingly facilitate or participate in any effort or attempt to make or implement any Acquisition Transaction;\n(d) participate in any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d to vote (as such terms are used in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission), or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any securities of the disclosing party;\n(e) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or other policies of the disclosing party; or\n(f) request the disclosing party or any of its Representatives to amend or waive any provisions of this paragraph 9.\nAs used in this paragraph 9, \u201cAcquisition Transaction\u201d means any acquisition or exchange of all or any material portion of the assets of, or 15% or more of the equity interest in, the disclosing party or any of its subsidiaries (by purchase on the Nasdaq National Market or New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, direct purchase from the other party, tender or exchange offer or otherwise) or any business combination, merger or similar transaction (including an exchange of stock or assets) with or involving the disclosing party or any it its subsidiaries.\n10. No Recruitment of Other Party\u2019s Employees.\n(a) No Company Representative with knowledge of the potential business opportunity being explored will, directly or indirectly, recruit or solicit for hire any of the employees of ZipRealty set forth on Exhibit A, or aid anyone else in recruiting or soliciting for hire any of such employees, or induce or otherwise encourage any of such employees to leave their employment with ZipRealty, provided that general, non-targeted advertisements or solicitations through independent employment recruiters will not be deemed to breach the foregoing provisions of this sentence.\n(b) No ZipRealty Representative with knowledge of the potential business opportunity being explored will, directly or indirectly, recruit or solicit for hire any of the employees of Company set forth on Exhibit B, or aid anyone else in recruiting or soliciting for hire any of such employees, or induce or otherwise encourage any of such employees to leave their employment with Company, provided that general, non-targeted advertisements or solicitations through independent employment recruiters will not be deemed to breach the foregoing provisions of this sentence.\n11. No Conflicting Obligations. Each disclosing party hereby represents and warrants that it may rightfully disclose the Confidential Information to the receiving party, and enter into the potential business opportunity being explored, in each case without violating any contractual, legal, fiduciary or other obligation to any person. The representing party shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party against any damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred in connection with any misrepresentation by the representing party in the foregoing sentence.\n12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties concerning the matters set forth herein. Further this Agreement shall supersede the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between the parties effective March 28, 2014 (the \u201cMarch NDA\u201d), provided however that the March NDA shall apply to the parties\u2019 communications subject to the terms of the March NDA from March 28, 2014 until the effective date of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Agreement, neither party will be committed in any way concerning the potential business opportunity being explored unless and until a definitive written agreement with respect thereto is duly authorized and executed by the appropriate officers of both parties.\n13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict-of-laws principles. The federal and state courts within the State of California will have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of this Agreement. Each party irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and expressly waives any objection to such jurisdiction based on inconvenient forum or otherwise.\n14. Remedies. Each party agrees that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the other party and the other party\u2019s business and expressly agrees that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate the other party for any breach by either party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, each party agrees and acknowledges that any such violation or threatened violation may cause irreparable injury to the other party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or otherwise, the other party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.\n15. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be binding upon and for the benefit of the undersigned parties, their successors and assigns. Failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any term hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by both ZipRealty and Company.\n16. Term. The foregoing commitments in this Agreement will survive any termination of discussions between the parties, and will continue for a period of two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, except to the extent explicitly terminated in writing by both ZipRealty and Company.\nZIPREALTY, INC.

During the course of such Discussions and any subsequent negotiations (the \""Negotiations\""), either party may have need of information from the other party that is regarded as confidential or may constitute a trade secret or other proprietary corporate information. Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information.\n(a) \""Confidential Information\"" as used in this Agreement is defined as written or oral information or materials, in whatever form, that (i) is disclosed by one party (the \""Disclosing Party\"") to the other party (the \""Receiving Party\"") in connection with the Discussions and/or the Negotiations; and (ii) relates to the business and/or affairs of the Disclosing Party, and includes, but is not limited to, the business and marketing plans and strategies, customers, suppliers, distributors, agents, research and product development plans, products, product cycles, technology, operations, assets, intellectual property, know-how, software, source code, copyright works, trade-marks, concepts, ideas, data, designs, \""look and feel\"" design elements, specifications, inventions, algorithms, formulae, processes, techniques, systems and improvements, partnerships, joint ventures, financial statements, financial projections, models, studies, and works in progress of the Disclosing Party.\n(b) \""Confidential Information\"" as used in this Agreement shall not include:\n(i) information that is publicly known at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party or thereafter becomes publicly known (other than as a result of a breach of the obligations of the Receiving Party contained in this Agreement to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information);\n(ii) information that is actually known to the Receiving Party prior to the time of receipt of such Confidential Information by the Disclosing Party;\n(iii) information that is furnished to the Receiving Party by a third party who, to the best of the Receiving Party's knowledge after due inquiry, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or by an obligation of confidence to, the Disclosing Party;\n(iv) information that is independently acquired or developed by the Receiving Party without use of, or reference to, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and without otherwise contravening the terms and provisions of this Agreement; and\n(v) information in regards to which the Disclosing Party authorizes in writing to the Receiving Party their release from the confidentiality and/or limited use obligations contained in this Agreement.\n2. Non-Disclosure. The Receiving Party shall, during the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years after the termination of this Agreement, use reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information and to limit its disclosure to only:\n(a) those of its directors, officers, employees, agents or professional advisors as have a need to know that Confidential Information in order that the objectives of the Discussions and Negotiations can be achieved; and\n(b) to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries so long as the affiliate or subsidiary understands and agrees that the Confidential Information is being provided subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the term \""reasonable care\"" shall mean the same degree of care exercised by the Receiving Party with respect to its own information of the same nature as Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for the compliance by any of the parties listed in subsections 2(a) and (b) above with the provisions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall issue written instructions to those parties listed in subsections 2(a) and (b) above requiring them to comply with the Receiving Party's obligations referred to in this Section 2 and to use the Confidential Information only to assist in achieving the objectives of the Discussions and Negotiations. Any failure on the part of any of those parties listed in subsections 2(a) and (b) above to comply with the written instructions will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 2 by the Receiving Party.\n3. Legally Required Disclosure. If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall:\n(a) provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; and\n(b) delay such disclosure as long as reasonably possible (without incurring liability for failure to make such a disclosure) to permit the Disclosing Party to seek a protection order and to allow for consultation with the Disclosing Party with respect to any reasonable alternatives to the required disclosure and with respect to the content of that disclosure.\nIn the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that Confidential Information which the Receiving Party's counsel advises by written opinion is legally required to be disclosed and, to the extent possible under the circumstances, shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information that is disclosed.\n4. Use of Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not be copied or used by the Receiving Party for any purpose other than the Discussions and Negotiations. With regard to Confidential Information that is covered by copyrights belonging to the Disclosing Party, it is agreed that the Disclosing Party reserves all rights therein. However, the parties further agree that a limited number of copies of written information covered by such copyrights may be made by the Receiving Party so that the Receiving Party can adequately use such Confidential Information within the terms and conditions of this Agreement, provided that all proprietary legends and notices on the originals are also reproduced on such copies and that each copy is controlled by the Receiving Party as an original in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n5.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring upon the Receiving Party, expressly, impliedly, or otherwise, any licenses or other rights under any patents, trademarks or any other intellectual and/or proprietary rights which the Disclosing Party now owns or may acquire after this Agreement takes effect.\n6. Return of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall, at its own expense, promptly return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information, including all written information, whether originals or copies of documents, records, summaries, analyses, and notes, and all materials in its possession that contain Confidential Information, regardless of who authored or generated such written information or materials, to the Disclosing Party immediately upon their request. If any of the Confidential Information is destroyed prior to the request, an adequate response to a return request of that Confidential Information by the Disclosing Party will be a written certificate, executed by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party, certifying that the relevant Confidential Information was destroyed. Additionally, the Receiving Party shall at the same time remove all digital representations, in any form, that contain any Confidential Information, from all electronic storage media in its possession or under its control.\n7. Information Regarding Existence of Discussions and Negotiations. During the term of this Agreement, except as required by law, no party shall issue any statement, confirm or otherwise disclose to the general public, to the news media or to any third party, except with the prior written consent of the other party both as to the content and timing of the disclosure (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed):\n(a) that the Discussions and/or Negotiations are taking or have taken place;\n(b) that the parties have exchanged information with a view toward the consummation of any agreement; or\n(c) the existence of this Agreement.\n8. No Warranty or Representation. The Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the Receiving Party or any other person as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information and shall be under no obligation to update, supplement or amend the Confidential Information as a result of subsequent events or developments or for any other reason. The Disclosing Party shall have no liability, direct or indirect, to the Receiving Party or any other person as a result of the use of, or reliance on, any Confidential Information delivered to the Receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement.\n9. No Commitment to Enter Into Any Other Agreement(s). The parties agree that the execution of this Agreement does not in any way constitute a binding commitment on the part of either party to complete the Discussions or Negotiations or enter into any joint business initiative(s) or any other resulting transaction(s) with the other party.\n10. Right to Enjoin Disclosure. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement is necessary to protect their trade, commercial and financial interests, and that a Receiving Party's unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information or other breach of this Agreement will result in immediate and irreparable harm that cannot be fully or adequately compensated by monetary damages. The parties accordingly agree that in addition to claiming damages, the Disclosing Party may seek a temporary restraining order and injunction to protect its Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will not raise the defence of an adequate remedy at law. This provision does not alter any other remedies available to the parties.\n11. Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other party. Notwithstanding termination, the obligations of limited use and nondisclosure under this Agreement shall remain in effect until expiration of the period referred to in Section 2.\n12. Amendment; Entire Agreement. This Agreement may only be amended by written agreement of both parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding confidentiality and use of Confidential Information disclosed in connection with the Discussions or the Negotiations. This Agreement supersedes all previous oral and written agreements, if any, between the parties regarding the confidentiality of information disclosed in connection with the Discussions or the Negotiations.\n13. No Assignment. Neither party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party, unless the assignment is made to an affiliate of the assigning party or is part of the merger, sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the assigning party used to carry out the business to which this Agreement pertains and all of the obligations under this Agreement are assumed by the assignee or transferee.\n14.

In connection with Schneider serving on the Company's board, Schneider and other Company employees, directors, and agents may divulge nonpublic information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries to the Stilwell Group and such information may be shared among the Stilwell Group's employees and agents who have a need to know such information. The Stilwell Group expressly agrees to maintain all nonpublic information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries in confidence. The Stilwell Group expressly acknowledges that federal and state securities laws may prohibit a person from purchasing or selling securities of a company, or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities, while the first-mentioned person is in possession of material nonpublic information about such company. The Stilwell Group agrees to comply with the Company's insider trading and disclosure policies, as in effect from time to time, to the same extent as if it were a director of the Company. To the extent the nonpublic information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries received by the Stilwell Group is material, this Agreement is intended to satisfy the confidentiality agreement exclusion of Regulation FD of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \""SEC\"") set forth in Section 243.100(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation FD.\n2. Each of the Stilwell Group and Schneider represents and warrants to the Company that this Agreement has been duly and validly authorized (in the case of the entity members of the Stilwell Group), executed and delivered by them, and is a valid and binding agreement enforceable against them in accordance with its terms.\n3. Schneider hereby further represents and warrants to the Company that: (a) he satisfies all of the qualifications to be a director of the Company as set forth in Article III, Section 4 of the Company's bylaws and any additional applicable qualifications under the laws of the State of Washington or under the regulations of any bank regulatory authority, and that he is not in any way precluded from serving as a director by order or other action of any court, regulatory or other governmental authority; and (b) no event has occurred with respect to Schneider that would require disclosure in a document filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under Item 401(f) of SEC Regulation S-K.\n4. The Stilwell Group acknowledges that with regard to its obligations to maintain the confidentiality of nonpublic information of the Company and its subsidiaries, monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and that, in addition to all other remedies, the Company may be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for such breach, and in conjunction therewith the Company shall not be required to post any bond.\n5. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions of the parties in connection therewith not referred to herein.\n6. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to choice of law principles that may otherwise compel the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

The terms and provisions of this agreement shall be deemed severable, and in the event any term or provision hereof or portion thereof is deemed or held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be conformed to prevailing law rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties, and, in any event, the remaining terms and provisions of this agreement shall nevertheless continue and be deemed to be in full force and effect and binding upon the parties.\n8.

As a condition to such information being furnished to each party and its controlled subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), each party agrees to treat any nonpublic information concerning the other party (whether prepared by the disclosing party, its Representatives or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication) that is furnished hereunder to a party or to its Representatives now or in the future during the term of this letter agreement by or on behalf of the disclosing party (herein collectively referred to as the \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d) in accordance with the provisions of this letter agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions hereinafter set forth.\n1. Evaluation Material. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d shall be deemed to include all information, records, notes, analyses, compilations, studies, reports, projections, forecasts, interpretations or other documents prepared by each party or its Representatives that contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to such party or its Representatives pursuant hereto, which is not available to the general public. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party or its Representatives, (ii) was within the receiving party\u2019s possession prior to its being furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the disclosing party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with (or subject to any other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to) the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with (or subject to any other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to) the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of Evaluation Material provided such independent development can reasonably be proven by contemporaneous written records. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by the disclosing party to include any legend or other marking of the Evaluation Material as confidential or proprietary shall not be dispositive as to whether such information is Evaluation Material, provided that such information should reasonably be deemed by its nature to be confidential.\n2. Purpose of Disclosure of Evaluation Material. It is understood and agreed to by each party that any exchange of information under this Agreement shall be solely for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction and shall not affect, in any way, each party\u2019s relative competitive position to the other party or to other entities. It is further agreed that the information to be disclosed to each other shall only be that information which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the Transaction and that information which is not reasonably necessary for such purposes shall not be disclosed or exchanged. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any information that is inadvertently disclosed and not reasonably necessary for such purposes shall be immediately returned to the disclosing party, and shall otherwise be treated as Evaluation Material.\n3. Use of Evaluation Material. Each party hereby agrees that it and its Representatives shall use the other\u2019s Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction.

A \u201cneed to know\u201d means that the Representative(s) requires access to the Confidential Information in order to accomplish or effect the Transaction. The receiving party shall be responsible for any breaches of the terms of this Agreement by its Representatives and the receiving party agrees, at its sole expense, to take all reasonable measures (including, but not limited to, court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Evaluation Material.

Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement not otherwise defined have the meaning given such term in the Merger Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cBusiness\u201d means the business of banking (including, without limitation, the acceptance of deposits and the making of loans) as conducted by state chartered banks, nationally chartered banks or office of thrift supervision chartered institutions conducting business in the state of California (a) to be undertaken in the formation of a new banking organization or (b) engaged in by an existing banking organization with $1 billon or less of assets.\n2. Purpose. Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the market for the Business is very competitive within the Restrictive Territory (as defined herein), and one way that Diablo maintained its business and its competitive position in the marketplace prior to the Closing was by investing time and money in developing proprietary products, unique approaches to the business, banking systems and strong client, vendor, and employee relationships. Shareholder further acknowledges and agrees that proprietary and other information related to such products, approaches and relationships are highly confidential, and maintaining that confidentiality is critical to Diablo\u2019s success. Shareholder further acknowledges and agrees that Diablo has invested substantial time and resources into developing relationships, customer lists and business models and strategies and that disruption of such relationships or misuse of such lists, models, and strategies would damage Heritage and HBC.\n3. Shareholder Covenants.\n(a) Non-Competition. Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees that from the Effective Date until the third (3 )rd anniversary of the Effective Date (\u201cRestricted Period\u201d), Shareholder will not without the prior written consent of Heritage, engage or participate or have any interest, directly or indirectly, in any Business anywhere in the counties of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo located in the State of California (\u201cRestricted Territory\u201d) (all such entities shall be referred to each as \u201cCompetitor\u201d or collectively as \u201cCompetitors,\u201d), with respect to the following acts: (i) own any equity interest in any Competitor; (ii) operate, join, control, advise, become a founder or otherwise participate in any Competitor; (iii) lend credit or money for the purpose of assisting another to establish or operate any Competitor; (iv) request or advise any customer, strategic partner or vendor of Diablo that becomes a present or future customer, strategic partner or vendor of Heritage, HBC or their subsidiaries now and hereinafter existing (collectively, the \u201cAffiliated Companies\u201d) to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business with Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies anywhere in the Restricted Territory; (v) induce or influence (or attempt to induce or influence) any person or entity who is engaged (as an employee, agent, independent contractor or otherwise) by Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies to terminate his, her or its employment or engagement for the purpose of obtaining employment with a Competitor; (vi) solicit any employee of Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies to leave employment and become affiliated with any Competitor; (vii) solicit any actual or \u201cprospective customer\u201d (as hereinafter defined), which was served by Diablo in connection with any business of Diablo, or (viii) solicit, influence or attempt to influence any customer which is or was served by Diablo to discontinue its business or service available from Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies; provided, that, Shareholder may own and hold as an investment of up to 1% of any corporation within the Restricted Territory that is listed on a national stock exchange and that is engaged in a business that is competitive with Heritage, HBC or an Affiliated Company, but Shareholder may not otherwise participate (whether in management or otherwise) in such corporation. A \u201cprospective customer\u201d shall mean a company, person or other entity with which Shareholder knows, or reasonably should know, that Diablo has had actual contact with or has begun formulating a targeted strategy for contact at any time during the term of this Agreement in connection with the operation of the Business. \u201cEngaged in business\u201d shall include, without limitation, establishment of goodwill or business reputation, maintenance of business assets and properties, and dealings with customers, strategic partners, prospective customers, suppliers, or vendors.\n(b) Confidentiality. Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the Shareholder has occupied a position of trust and confidence with Diablo prior to the date hereof and has had access to and has become familiar with the following, any and all of which constitutes confidential information of Diablo (collectively \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) (a) any and all proprietary intellectual property or trade secrets concerning the business and affairs of Diablo, product specifications, data, know-how, formulae, compositions, processes, designs, graphs, drawings, samples, inventions and ideas, past, current and planned research and development, customer lists, current and anticipated customer requirements, price lists, market studies, business plans, computer software and programs (including object code and source code), database technologies, systems, structures, architectures, processes, improvements, devices, know-how, discoveries, concepts, methods, information of Diablo and any other information, however documented, of Diablo that is a trade secret within the meaning of any applicable law; (b) any and all proprietary non-public information concerning the business and affairs of Diablo (which includes any historical financial statements, financial projections, and budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending budgets and plans, the names and backgrounds of key personnel, contractors, agents, suppliers, personnel training, techniques and materials, manufacturing methods, designs and techniques, purchasing methods and techniques, however documented; and (c) any and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries and other material prepared by or for Diablo containing or based, in whole or part, upon any information included in the foregoing.\nShareholder acknowledges and agrees that the protection of the Confidential Information is necessary to protect and preserve the value of Diablo\u2019s business and proprietary properties being acquired by Heritage and HBC. Therefore, Shareholder hereby agrees not to, at any time, disclose to any unauthorized Persons or use for his or its own account or for the benefit of any third party any Confidential Information, whether or not such information is embodied in writing or other physical form or is retained in the memory of Shareholder, without Heritage\u2019s written consent, unless and to the extent that the Confidential Information is or becomes generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a result of Shareholder\u2019s fault or the fault of any other Person bound by a duty of confidentiality to Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies. Shareholder agrees to deliver to Heritage at the Effective Date, and at any other time Heritage may request, all documents, memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports and other documentation, models, components, devices or computer software, whether embodied in a disk or in other form (and all copies of all of the foregoing), that contain Confidential Information and any other Confidential Information that Shareholder may then possess or have under Shareholder\u2019s control.\n(c) Breach. Shareholder, Heritage and HBC each recognize and acknowledge that the Confidential Information and other knowledge Shareholder has about Diablo and has and will obtain from Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies is special and unique, and any violation of the covenants contained in this Agreement is likely to cause irreparable damage to Heritage, HBC or the Affiliated Companies. Therefore, the parties agree that, upon any breach of any covenant contained in this Section 3 by Shareholder, Heritage and HBC shall be entitled to an appropriate injunction for a violation of such covenant, threatened or actual, of such covenant, in addition to all other relief available under applicable law. If a court or arbitrator has determined that Shareholder has committed a breach by Shareholder of any covenant set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement, the Restricted Period will be extended by the period of the duration of such breach.\n(d) Acknowledgment. Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions set forth in this Section 3 are reasonable in scope and essential to the preservation of Diablo\u2019s business and proprietary properties and that enforcement of these restrictions will not cause Shareholder any hardship, and because of Shareholder\u2019s background and experience, will not in any manner preclude Shareholder from becoming gainfully employed in such a manner and to such an extent as will provide a standard of living for Shareholder and the members of Shareholder\u2019s family of at least the sort and fashion to which they have become accustomed. Each of Heritage, HBC and Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 3 have been negotiated in good faith by each of them. Each of Heritage, HBC and Shareholder further acknowledges that (i) the goodwill associated with the existing vendors, customers, assets and employees of Diablo prior to the transactions contemplated herein is an integral component of the value of Diablo to Heritage and HBC and is reflected in the consideration to be received by Diablo shareholders, including the Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the covenants and agreements contained in this Section 3 are necessary to preserve the value of Diablo\u2019s business and proprietary properties for Heritage and HBC following the transaction. Each of Heritage, HBC and Shareholder acknowledges that the limitations of time, geography and scope of activity agreed to in Section 3 are reasonable because, among other things: (A) Heritage, HBC and Diablo are engaged in a highly competitive industry and have their operations in the Restricted Territory, (B) Shareholder had unique access to, and will continue to have access to, Confidential Information, including trade secrets, and know-how of Diablo and its business and proprietary properties, (C) Shareholder is receiving significant consideration in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, and (D) this Agreement provides no more protection than is necessary to protect Heritage\u2019s and HBC\u2019s interest in the goodwill of Diablo and its business and proprietary properties, Confidential Information and Diablo, Heritage and HBC trade secrets.\n(e) No Disparagement. Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, disparage Heritage and HBC, the business formerly conducted by Diablo, the business conducted by Heritage and HBC or any shareholder, director, officer, employee or agent of Heritage or HBC;\n(f) Future Employer. Shareholder will, during the Restrictive Period, within ten days after accepting any employment, consulting engagement, engagement as an independent contractor, partnership or other association that might reasonably involve the Business, advise Heritage of the identity of the new employer, client, partner or other Person with whom Shareholder has become associated. Following receipt of such notice, if Heritage in its reasonable judgment determines that Shareholder\u2019s proposed association involves a Person engaged in the Business, Heritage may serve notice upon each such Person that such Shareholder is bound by this Agreement and furnish each such Person with a copy of this Agreement or relevant portions thereof.\n(g) Separate Agreement. The covenants of Shareholder contained in this Section 3 shall each be construed independently of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Shareholder against Heritage or HBC whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Heritage or HBC of such covenants.\n(h) Survival of Covenants. The covenants contained in this Section 3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement by either party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.\n4. Conflict. Shareholder represents and warrants to Heritage and HBC that Shareholder has not executed any written agreement with any other person or entity that would prohibit Shareholder from entering into this Agreement. Further, Shareholder represents and warrants to Heritage and HBC that the execution of this Agreement by Shareholder will not conflict with any obligations or duties which Shareholder may have to prior employers or pursuant to any other agreement.\n5. Non-Disclosure of Agreement. Shareholder shall not disclose the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any other document executed in connection herewith except to Shareholder\u2019s lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and spouse or by law to any Person; provided that Shareholder may disclose the non-competition and confidentiality covenants contained in Section 3 of this Agreement to a prospective employer or business partner with the prior written consent of Heritage.\n6. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement will be binding upon Heritage and HBC and Shareholder and will inure to the benefit of Heritage and HBC and its affiliates, successors and assigns.\n7. Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right except in writing; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party, or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to require the other party, to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.\n8. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws applied by courts of California to contracts entered into within that state by parties residing within that state and having no connection to any other state.\n9. Jurisdiction; Service of Process. Any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought in the courts of the State of California, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and each of the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. The parties agree that either or both of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive any objections to venue or to convenience of forum. Process in any proceeding referred to in the first sentence of this section may be served on any party as required under California law.\n10. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision and term of this Agreement will be interpreted in a manner to be effective and valid, but if any provision or term of this Agreement is held to be prohibited or invalid, then such provision or term will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating or affecting in any manner whatsoever the remainder of such provision or term or the remaining provisions or terms of this Agreement. If any of the covenants set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, such covenants will be considered divisible with respect to scope, time and geographic area, and in such lesser scope, time and geographic area, will be effective, binding and enforceable against Shareholder to the fullest extent under California law.\n11. Execution of Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile transmission shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes.

(\""MDI\""), whose address is 201 Ann Street, 5th Floor, Hartford, Connecticut 06103 and Scientific Games Corporation (\""Scientific Games\"") whose address is 750 Lexington Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, New York 10022.\nW I T N E S S E T H:\n WHEREAS, in connection with the analyses of a possible negotiated transaction between MDI and Scientific Games (collectively, the \""Companies\""), each of the Companies has requested or will request certain oral and written information concerning the other Company from the officers, directors, employees and/or agents of the respective Companies (collectively, the \""Evaluation Material\"").\n NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, each of which is made a contractual part hereof, MDI and Scientific Games agree in consideration of furnishing the other party with the Evaluation Material (it being understood that the parties are also agreeing to cause such of their respective affiliates, representatives and agents, including but not limited to, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which are provided with the Evaluation Material to comply with the provisions hereof):\n (1) The Evaluation Material will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Companies and not in any way directly or indirectly detrimental to the Companies (competitively or otherwise), and unless and until the parties have completed a transaction pursuant to a formal contractually binding agreement (\""Definitive Agreement\""), such information will be kept confidential, except that each party may disclose the Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and professional representatives (the persons to whom such disclosure is permissible being collectively called \""Representatives\"") in each case who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction between the Companies; provided, however, that prior to disclosing the Evaluation Material or any portion thereof to any of such Representatives, the disclosing party will secure the undertaking of its Representative to be bound by the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent that the disclosing party is bound by this Agreement. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement or such undertaking by it or its Representatives. In the event that either party or any of its Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material, such party shall provide the other party with prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the other party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the disclosing party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material which it is advised by written opinion of its counsel is legally required and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material.\n (2) The term \""Evaluation Material\"" does not include any information which (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known by the public (other than in the case of Evaluation Material for Scientific Games as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by MDI or its Representatives and in the case of Evaluation Material for MDI as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by Scientific Games or its Representatives), (ii) was or becomes available to Scientific Games or MDI on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the other party or its advisors, provided that such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with or for the benefit of the party with respect to whom the information pertains, or (iii) was in the possession of the disclosing party prior to the date of this Agreement and was obtained by such party without the breach, directly or indirectly, by such party or any other person of any obligation or duty owed to the party with respect to whom the information pertains.\n (3) If a transaction between the Companies is not consummated or if either party at any time so requests, each party will promptly return to the other party all copies of the Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of its Representatives, and each party will destroy all copies of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by it or for its use containing or reflecting any Evaluation Material.\n (4) Without the prior written consent of the other party, each party will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose to any person either the status of the investigations, discussions or negotiations taking place concerning a possible transaction between the parties, or that either party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other party or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible transaction except as disclosed in that certain letter of intent between the parties dated February 25, 2002. The term \""person\"" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership or individual.

It is further understood that all (i) communications regarding the possible negotiated transaction contemplated hereby, (ii) requests for additional information, (ii) requests for facility tours or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed, in the case of Scientific Games, to Mr. Martin E. Schloss or Mr. C. Gray Bethea, Jr., and in the case of MDI, to Steve M. Saferin or Kenneth M. Przysiecki.\n (6) Each party understands and acknowledges that the other party is making no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and neither the disclosing party, nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, affiliates or agents will have any liability to the other party or any other person resulting from such other party's use of the Evaluation Material. Only those representations or warranties that are made to MDI or Scientific Games, as the case may be, in a Definitive Agreement when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Definitive Agreement, will have any legal effect.\n (7) Each party also understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered, and each party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with or involving the other party or any of its businesses based on the purported existence of any such contract or agreement unless and until and only to the extent that the parties shall have entered into a Definitive Agreement with respect to which a breach is alleged. Each party also agrees that unless and until a Definitive Agreement between the parties with respect to a negotiated transaction has been executed and delivered, neither of the parties nor their stockholders has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.

Neither this paragraph nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of the party which is sought to be bound, which consent shall specifically make such waiver or amendment.\n (8) Each party agrees that the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available to the other part at law or in equity.\n (9) It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information.

Nothing in this Section 4, or any other provision of this Agreement, shall be construed to prohibit Employee from reporting conduct to, providing truthful information to, or participating in any investigation or proceeding brought or conducted by any federal or state government agency or self-regulatory organization.\nEmployee specifically acknowledges that the Confidential Information, whether reduced to writing or maintained electronically or in the mind or memory of Employee and, whether compiled by a Banking Organization and/or the Employee, derives independent economic value from not being readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, that reasonable efforts have been put forth by each Banking Organization to maintain the secrecy of such information, that such information is the sole property of such Banking Organization and that any retention and/or use of such information during or after Employee\u2019s employment with either Financial Institution (except in the course of performing the Employee\u2019s duties of employment with a Financial Institution and except as otherwise set forth above) constitutes a misappropriation of a Banking Organization\u2019s Confidential Information.\nEmployee agrees that all Confidential Information and all records, documents and materials relating to all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of a Banking Organization, and upon Employee\u2019s termination of employment, all such Confidential Information, whether in paper or electronic form, shall be returned to a Financial Institution in good condition, without Employee retaining a copy thereof, including, but not limited to, retaining an electronic copy on any electronic device regardless of whether such device is owned by Employee. At a Financial Institution\u2019s request, Employee shall provide written verification, under the penalties for perjury, of his/her compliance with this covenant.\n5. Non-Solicitation of Customers and Potential Customers. Employee acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of Employee\u2019s position with a Banking Organization, Employee has or will have advantageous familiarity and personal contacts with Customers and Potential Customers and will have advantageous familiarity with the business operations and affairs of a Banking Organization. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been or will be placed in a position that, were Employee to leave a Financial Institution to compete with the business of a Banking Organization, such entity from which the Employee departed would, upon violation of this Agreement, suffer irreparable harm and financial loss, as well as lost goodwill and Confidential Information. Therefore, in consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution (\u201cRestriction Period\u201d), for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee\u2019s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee\u2019s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:\na. Solicit, divert, or take away (or attempt to Solicit, divert or take away) any Banking and Financial Services to or from any Customer or Potential Customer; or\nb. advise, persuade or induce (or attempt to advise, persuade or induce) any Customer or Potential Customer to terminate, reduce, limit, or change the Customer\u2019s services or business relationship, or the Potential Customer\u2019s contemplated services or business relationship, with a Financial Institution; or\nc. directly provide Banking and Financial Services to, or directly accept Banking and Financial Services from, any Customer or Potential Customer.\nThis Agreement is not intended to prevent Employee from accepting employment with an organization that competes with the Banking Organizations by offering Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers. The Parties acknowledge that Employee may be associated with such an Organization and that such association may place Employee in a senior or supervisory role to those in the organization that have contact with Customers or Potential Customers. Employee shall not be in violation of this Agreement merely by engaging in such a role, which may include:\na. supervising those who provide Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers;\nb. engaging in credit review, underwriting, loan approval, or financial analysis of a Customer or Potential Customer\u2019s business as a part of a supervisory or management role, so long as such activity does not require the disclosure of Confidential Information, direct contact with the Customer or Potential Customer, or the disclosure of Employee\u2019s role to the Customer or Potential Customer;\nc. performing or supervising those that perform data processing, accounting, rate review, document review or similar \u201cback room\u201d services related to a Customer or Potential Customer so long as the services do not require the disclosure of Confidential Information or contact with the Customer or Potential Customer.\n6. Non-Solicitation of Employees and Others. In consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee\u2019s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee\u2019s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:\nc. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Employee to terminate his or her employment with a Banking Organization, or offer or provide employment (whether such employment is with Employee or any other Person) either on a full-time or part-time, consulting or Independent Contractor basis; or\nd. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Independent Contractors or Agents to terminate their contract or relationship with a Banking Organization or discontinue providing services to a Banking Organization and/or Customers; or\ne. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any suppliers, vendors or others who were supplying services or goods to a Banking Organization during the one year period prior to Employee\u2019s termination, to terminate, reduce, limit or change their business or relationship with a Banking Organization.\n7. Tolling of Covenants. Employee acknowledges that a Banking Organization is entitled to the full post-termination restrictions on the activities set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as applicable. Therefore, in the event any of the provisions of these Sections are breached by Employee, the commencement of the applicable post-termination restriction will not begin until Employee is in full compliance with Section 5 and/or 6.\n8. Severability/Blue Pencil. Each of the provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenants in Sections 5 and 6, are distinct and severable, notwithstanding that the covenants may be set forth in one section for convenience. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, for any reason, neither the validity of the remaining part of such provision nor the validity of any other provision of this Agreement shall in any way be affected. Should any particular restrictive covenant, provision or clause of this Agreement be held unreasonable or unenforceable for any reason, including without limitation, the time period, geographic area and/or scope of activity covered by such covenant, provision or clause, the parties acknowledge and agree that such covenant, provision or clause shall be given effect and enforce to whatever extent would be\nreasonable and enforceable under applicable law. The parties expressly authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to modify or revise such provision to limit the covenants to cover the maximum period of time, range of activities or other restrictions as would be enforceable under Indiana law.\n9. Available Relief. Employee agrees that a Banking Organization, or its successor or assigns, will suffer irreparable damage and injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of any breach by Employee of any provision of Sections 4, 5 or 6, herein. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or of a threatened or attempted breach by Employee of Sections 4, 5, or 6, in addition to all other remedies to which a Banking Organization is entitled under law, in equity, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, monetary damages), a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary or permanent injunction (without the necessity of showing any actual damage) or a decree of specific performance and no bond or other security shall be required in that connection.\n10. Enforcement/Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In any action that is brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys\u2019 and paralegal fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. If a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, institute any action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, Employee hereby waives all claims or defenses that a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, have an adequate remedy at law, and Employee shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.\n11. Assignments; Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of Employee hereunder are not assignable or delegable by Employee, and any prohibited assignment or delegation will be null and void. The Banking Organization may, without the consent of the Employee, assign this Agreement to any successor or in connection with any merger, consolidation, share exchange, combination, sale of stock or assets or similar transaction. The provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of a Banking Organization.\n12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under, subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, without consideration of the choice of law principles thereof, and all questions concerning its validity, construction and administration shall be determined in accordance with Indiana law.\n13. Entire Agreement/Modification/Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and expressly supersedes any prior agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be terminated, amended or modified without the prior written consent of the Bank\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Employee. No failure or delay by a Banking Organization in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement operate or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach or noncompliance hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by a Banking Organization shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Bank\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. A waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and will not constitute a waiver for the future or act on anything other than that which is specifically waived.\n14. \u201cNo-Defense\u201d Provision. The covenants set forth in this Agreement are essential terms and conditions to a Banking Organization employing or continuing to employ Employee, and shall be construed as independent of any other obligations or agreements between Employee and a Banking Organization. The existence of any claim or cause of action Employee may have against a Banking Organization, including, but not limited to, the alleged material breach by a Banking Organization of any agreement with Employee, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by a Banking Organization of the covenants and obligations in this Agreement and shall not relieve Employee of his or her obligations under this Agreement.\n15. Jurisdiction and Venue. The parties agree that all suits, actions, proceedings, litigation, disputes, or claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be filed and tried in the Superior or Circuit Court, as appropriate, of Vigo County, Indiana, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Terre Haute Division. In this regard, the parties hereby: (a) agree that venue shall be such stated courts; (b) irrevocably consent to service of process and to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts; and (c) irrevocably waive any claim of inconvenient forum if any such suit, claim, proceeding, litigation, dispute, or claim has been filed, brought, or made in any of such courts.\n16. Construction. This Agreement is the result of negotiations between the parties, and no party shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement; accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed without any presumption or inference based upon or against the party causing this Agreement to be prepared. The language of this Agreement shall in all cases be construed as a whole, according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.\n17. Review and Consultation. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he/she has read this Agreement in its entirety prior to executing it, understands the provisions and effects of this Agreement, and has consulted with or had the opportunity to consult with an attorney or other advisers as he/she deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement.\n18. Section Headings. Section headings are inserted into this Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect any construction or interpretation of this Agreement.\n19. Reasonableness. Employee agrees and acknowledges that the covenants, restrictions and obligations set forth in this Agreement, including Sections 5 and 6, are reasonable and necessary to protect a Banking Organization. Employee agrees that the covenants, restrictions and obligations will not affect Employee\u2019s ability to make a living.\n20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed a duplicate original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties agree that signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic means are acceptable the same as original signatures for the execution of the Agreement.\n21. Miscellaneous. Any change in Employee\u2019s duties, responsibilities, title, position, compensation, or status, with a Financial Institution will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.\n22. Representations. Employee represents and warrants that he/she is not a party to an agreement with his or her prior employer(s) (other than Heritage or HopFed) or any other Person that prohibits Solicitation of business or competing with that employer or other Person. Employee affirms and represents that performance of his/her job duties and responsibilities for a Financial Institution does not, and will not, breach any agreement or covenant not to Solicit business, compete in business, or keep in confidence proprietary or confidential information acquired in confidence or in trust prior to Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution. Employee further represents that he/she has not retained any documents or information relating to Employee\u2019s prior employers (other than Heritage or HopFed) that may be considered confidential or proprietary information and that Employee has not disclosed or used, and will not disclose or use, any information relating to his or her prior employer(s) in connection with Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution.\n23. Return of Property. Upon termination of Employee\u2019s employment, Employee shall immediately return to the Bank (if subsequent to the Effective Time) or Heritage (if prior to the Effective Time), all Banking Organizations documents and property, including, but not limited to, Confidential Information, computer discs, manuals, reports, files, memoranda, records, door and file keys, passwords and access codes, and any other physical or tangible things that Employee received, prepared, or helped prepare in connection with the Employee\u2019s employment, and Employee shall not retain any copies, duplicates, reproductions or excerpts thereof. At the Bank\u2019s or Heritage\u2019s request, Employee shall provide written verification under the penalties for perjury of his/her compliance with this covenant.\n24. Survival. Except as set forth below, the covenants in Sections 4, 5, 6 and 23 shall survive the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution regardless of the reason for termination. If the Merger is not consummated and the Merger Agreement is terminated, Sections 4, 5, 6 and 23 shall survive with respect to First Financial and the Bank, but shall not survive with respect to HopFed or Heritage.\n[Signature Page to Follow]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date indicated below.\nFIRST FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ Norman L.

"      ""text"": ""Exhibit 10.22\nNON-DISCLOSURE, NON-COMPETITION, AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition, and Non-Solicitation Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into effective as of April 1, 2004 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between Level 3 Communications, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cLevel 3\u201d or the \u201cBuyer\u201d), on the one hand, and ICG Communications, Inc. (the \u201cParent\u201d), a Delaware corporation, and ICG Telecom Group, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d), a Delaware corporation, and for and on behalf of any of their direct or indirect parents, subsidiaries, successors, or Affiliates (collectively referred to as \u201cICG\u201d or the \u201cSellers\u201d), on the other hand.\nRECITALS\nA. The Sellers are engaged in conducting a dial-up ISP business whereby the Sellers provide Internet access and other Internet-related services to Internet service providers and their customers.\nB. The Buyer and Sellers are parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) dated as of April 1, 2004, pursuant to which Level 3 is purchasing from Sellers certain of Sellers\u2019 assets (the \u201cAcquired Assets\u201d) used or held for use by Sellers in conducting the Sellers\u2019 dial-up ISP business whereby the Company provides dial-up Internet access to Internet service providers and their customers, excluding the Company\u2019s direct Internet access and primary rate interface businesses (the \u201cBusiness\u201d), as more fully described therein. Contemporaneous with this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers are closing and consummating the principal transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.\nC. Sellers acknowledge that the Buyer would not enter into or close the Purchase Agreement without Sellers\u2019 agreement to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the execution of this Agreement by Sellers is a condition precedent to the Buyer\u2019s obligation to close under the Purchase Agreement.\nAGREEMENT\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Buyer\u2019s execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, the closing thereunder and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\nARTICLE 1 NON-DISCLOSURE, NON-COMPETITION AND NON-SOLICITATION\n1.1 Non-Disclosure. Sellers shall not disclose or appropriate for their own use, or for the use of any third party, at any time, any trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information included in or related to the Acquired Assets or the Business as previously operated by Sellers, whether or not developed by Sellers including, without limitation, information pertaining to the customers, vendors, prices, profits, contract terms or operating procedures of Sellers relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets; provided, however, that Sellers may use any such trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information (a) if and to the extent used in their businesses other than the Business and (b) in connection with providing services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.\n1.2 Non-Competition. For a period of three (3) years from and after the Effective Date (the \u201cRestrictive Period\u201d), Sellers shall not engage, directly or indirectly, through any other entity or with any person (whether as an owner, shareholder, partner, member, director, officer, employee, agent, investor, or otherwise), in any business activity which is in competition with the Business conducted by Buyer during the Restrictive Period. The foregoing restrictions shall, however, apply only for a one-year period from and after the Effective Date with respect to any successor of any Seller who is not engaged in the same type of business as the Business as of the Effective Date and shall not apply at all with respect to any successor, other than Sellers and any of their Affiliates as of the Effective Date, that is engaged in the same type of business as the Business. Because Sellers\u2019 Business is nationwide, Sellers agree that they will not so compete anywhere in the United States (the \u201cTerritory\u201d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may, during the 60-day period following the Effective Date, provide services in the Business to those customers delineated on Schedule 1.02(c) of the Purchase Agreement, subject to and in accordance with Section 5.08 of the Purchase Agreement; provided such services shall be provided solely pursuant to the customer contracts listed on such Schedule 1.02(c) and the amount of such service shall not be materially greater than that provided to such customers by Sellers during the 60-day period prior to the Effective Date.\n1.3 Non-Solicitation. During the Restrictive Period, without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which Buyer may withhold in the exercise of its sole, absolute, and arbitrary discretion), Sellers (including, without limitation, any successors) shall not induce or solicit, directly or indirectly, through any other entity or with any other person, (whether as an owner, shareholder, partner, member, director, officer, employee, agent, investor, or otherwise) any employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates who is involved in the managed modem business conducted by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, without limitation, the Business, to terminate the employee\u2019s employment with the Buyer or any such Affiliate.\n1.4 Remedies. Any breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Article 1 would result in irreparable damage to the Buyer. Consequently, and without limiting other remedies which may exist for a breach of this Agreement, the Buyer will have the right to enforce such covenants by obtaining a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction restraining any violation hereof, pending or following a trial on the merits, without posting any bond and in addition to all other remedies available to the Buyer at law or in equity.\n1.5 Reasonableness of Covenants. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the covenants contained in this Agreement are reasonable in all respects, including without limitation their duration and geographic scope. Sellers expressly waive any defenses as to the reasonableness of such covenants in any action between the parties to enforce this Agreement.\n1.6 Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement:\n(a) \u201cAffiliate\u201d means, with respect to any Person, a Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with, such Person; provided that a Person will not be deemed to Control another Person if the only indicia of such Control is voting control of more than 10% but less than 20% of outstanding, publicly traded equity securities of such other Person.\n(b) \u201cControl\u201d (including the terms \u201cControlled by\u201d and \u201cunder common Control with\u201d) means, as used with respect to any Person, possession, directly or indirectly or as a trustee or executor, of power to direct or cause the direction of management or policies of such Person (whether through ownership of voting securities, as trustee or executor, by agreement or otherwise).\n(c) \u201cPerson\u201d means an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.\n(d) Other terms used but not defined herein have the respective meanings given to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.\nARTICLE 2 MISCELLANEOUS\n2.1 Validity. Sellers acknowledge that the Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation covenants set forth in Article 1 are necessary to protect the Buyer from competing efforts and to insure that the Buyer receives the benefits for which it has paid by closing under the Purchase Agreement. If either the Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition or Non-Solicitation provisions contained in this Agreement are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable under applicable law with respect to duration or scope of the agreements, then the Non-Disclosure Agreement, Non-Competition Agreement or Non-Solicitation Agreement, as applicable, will be deemed unenforceable in such part or parts of the Territory for such lesser period of time and for such limited scope as is permissible under applicable law.\n2.2 Waiver. The Buyer\u2019s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or prevent the Buyer thereafter from enforcing each and every provision of this Agreement.\n2.3 Applicable Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Colorado applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such jurisdiction. The parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Colorado and of the United States of America, in each case located in the County of Denver, for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its respective address set forth in this Agreement shall be effective service of process for any litigation brought against it in any such court. The parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any litigation arising out of this Agreement in the courts of the State of Colorado or the United States of America, in each case, located in the County of Denver, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such litigation brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n2.4 Attorney Fees. If any action at law or in equity is brought to enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, expert witness fees and all other disbursements in addition to any other relief to which it or he may be entitled.\n2.5 Modification. This Agreement may not be amended or modified by the parties except by a written agreement executed by both parties.\n2.6 Headings or Captions. Headings or captions contained in this Agreement have been inserted herein only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.\n2.7 Construction. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise: (i) references to the plural include the singular and vice versa; (ii) references to one gender include all genders; (iii) \u201cincluding\u201d is not limiting; (iv) \u201cor\u201d has the inclusive meaning represented by the phrase \u201cand/or\u201d; (v) the words \u201chereof\u201d, \u201cherein\u201d, \u201chereby\u201d, \u201chereunder\u201d and similar terms in this Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement; (vi) section and clause references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified; (vii) reference to any agreement (including this Agreement), document or instrument means such agreement, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and, if applicable, the terms hereof; and (vii) general or specific references to any Law mean such Law as amended, modified, codified or reenacted, in whole or in part, and in effect from time to time, unless the effect thereof is to reduce, limit or otherwise prejudicially affect any obligation or any right, power or remedy hereunder, in which case such amendment, modification, codification or reenactment will not, to the maximum extent permitted by Law, form part of this Agreement and is to be disregarded for purposes of the construction and interpretation hereof.\n2.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties on any number of separate counterparts, and all such counterparts so executed constitute one agreement binding on all the parties notwithstanding that all the parties are not signatories to the same counterpart.\n2.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement and the documents referred to therein constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, letters of intent, understandings, negotiations and discussions of the parties, whether oral or written.\n2.10 Failure or Delay. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or privilege hereunder operates as a waiver thereof; nor does any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No notice to or demand on any party in any case entitles such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.\n2.11 Notice.

Pyramid and the Company are sometimes referred to in this Agreement individually as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties\u201d.\n WHEREAS, Pyramid is a reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission and files reports and proxy materials under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are publicly available.\n WHEREAS, the Parties wish to exchange certain nonpublic confidential business information for purposes of engaging in preliminary discussions regarding and evaluating a possible strategic merger, acquisition or business combination between the Parties (the \u201cBusiness Purpose\u201d).\n NOW THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:\n 1. Definition of Confidential Information. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any and all information that is or has been received by either Party (the \u201cRecipient\u201d) from the other Party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), or which the Recipient has had access to, during the four (4)-month period commencing on the Effective Date (the \u201cTerm\u201d), and that is either (a) marked as \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201cproprietary,\u201d or such similar term, or (b) non-public information related to the Disclosing Party\u2019s business, which the Receiving Party should reasonably know is confidential based on the nature of such information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Confidential Information shall include the following, whether in tangible or electronic form: business plans, customer database information, employee and independent contractor lists, internal reports and investigations, research and work in progress, source and object code, technical manuals, financial statements and projections, cost summaries and pricing formulae, algorithms, confidential filings with any international, federal or state agency, and all other information concerning methods of doing business, ideas and inventions (whether or not patentable), and data that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use that is the subject of reasonable efforts by the Company to maintain its secrecy.\n 2. Excluded Information. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party is already lawfully and rightfully known by or available to the Recipient as evidenced by prior written records;\n(b) through no wrongful act, fault or negligence on the part of the Recipient is or hereafter becomes part of the public domain; (c) is lawfully received by the Recipient from a third party without restriction and without breach of this agreement or any other agreement; (d) is approved for public release or use by written authorization of the Disclosing Party; (e) the Recipient can demonstrate was independently developed by it without reference to the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information; or (f) is disclosed pursuant to the requirement or request of a governmental agency or court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such disclosure is required by a valid law, regulation or court order and sufficient notice is given by the Recipient to the Disclosing Party of any such requirement or request in order to permit the Disclosing Party to seek an appropriate protective order or exemption from such requirement or request.\n 3. Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality. The Recipient shall not (a) use the Confidential Information except for the Business Purpose, or (b) disclose or make the Confidential Information available to any person or entity (other than Related Parties, as defined below) without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Each Party shall take reasonable security precautions to protect the Confidential Information, at least as strict as the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature. Without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient of Confidential Information shall restrict the disclosure and availability of Confidential Information to Recipient\u2019s financial, tax, or legal advisors, or to its directors, officers, or employees with a demonstrable need to know such Confidential Information (each, a \u201cRelated Party\u201d, and, collectively, the \u201cRelated Parties\u201d), provided that any such Related Party either agrees to be bound by this Agreement or is already bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those in this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for the breach of this Agreement by any Related Party. Neither Party shall use any Confidential Information received by it to develop a product or service which competes with or imitates products of the Disclosing Party or engage in reverse engineering to develop similar products or services using the Confidential Information (it being acknowledged and understood that both Parties are engaged in the business of beer brewing and that competing beer products are regularly independently developed within the beer industry using the same or similar raw materials, processes and packaging). The Recipient shall prevent commingling of the Confidential Information with similar information or material of other third parties. The obligations of confidentiality and protection under this Agreement shall survive for three (3) years following the expiration of the Term.\n 4. Non-Solicitation. Other than through general employment listings and advertising or through the efforts of employment search firms, each Party shall not, during the Term of this Agreement and for one (1) year thereafter, directly or indirectly, solicit or hire any employee or independent contractor of the other Party, or induce any such person to abandon their relationship with the other Party.\n 5. No Warranty. THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS,\u201d AND THE DISCLOSING PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ACCURACY, SUFFICIENCY, SUITABILITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF SUCH CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n 6. No License or Obligations; Return of Confidential Information. This Agreement does not represent nor imply any agreement or commitment to enter into any further business relationship. This Agreement does not create any agency or partnership relationship between the Parties or authorize a Party to use the other Party\u2019s name or trademarks. As between the Parties, all Confidential Information received by a Recipient shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party. Upon written request by the Disclosing Party, the Recipient shall return to the Disclosing Party, or shall destroy in a manner satisfactory to the Disclosing Party, all tangible or electronic forms of Confidential Information, including any and all copies of the Confidential Information or notes containing the Confidential Information, and shall provide a written certification to the Disclosing Party that all tangible forms of the Confidential Information have been returned or destroyed.\n 7. Remedies for Breach. The Parties agree that money damages would be inadequate to remedy any breach of this Agreement.

"      ""text"": ""Exhibit (e)(6)\nNON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), effective as of November 15, 2012 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), is made and entered into by and between Online Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\u201cORCC\u201d), and ACI Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\nWHEREAS, ORCC and Receiving Party (the \u201cParties\u201d) wish to explore the possibility of engaging in a potential transaction (a \u201cTransaction\u201d);\nWHEREAS, in connection with a possible Transaction, Receiving Party desires to gain access to certain Confidential Information (as such terra is defined below) of ORCC; and\nWHEREAS, ORCC is willing to disclose such Confidential Information to Receiving Party upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information: Scope.\n(a) As used in this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means and includes any and all confidential and/or proprietary information and data, whether in written, tangible, intangible, digital, electronic or oral form, that is disclosed or made available by or on behalf of ORCC to Receiving Party or its Representatives, including without limitation all record-bearing media containing or disclosing such information, relating to the business or operations of ORCC, or is derived therefrom, and includes (without limitation), any and all: (i) non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information of any third party in the possession of ORCC; (ii) ORCC trade secrets, techniques, discoveries, ideas, inventions, concepts, software in various states of development, designs, drawings, images, specifications, data, diagrams, research, economic and financial analyses, strategic plans and analyses, marketing and advertising techniques, client (or customer) and vendor names, client data, new product launches, price data, sales data, personnel files and materials, and all record-bearing media containing or disclosing such information; (iii) all identifiable and/or sensitive \u201cpersonal information\u201d (as such term is defined in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended) of end users of ORCC\u2019s services, without specific designation as such (including, but not limited to, names, addresses, social security numbers, account numbers and account balances), and all record-bearing media containing or disclosing such information; and (iv) financial information, including (if provided) financial forecasts, projections or plans. All such information shall be treated as ORCC\u2019s Confidential Information under this Agreement regardless of whether or not it is marked or identified as \u201cConfidential Information.\u201d Except as provided in Section 4, neither Party shall announce, disclose or publicize in any manner this Agreement, the terms, or any discussions or negotiations covered by or relating to this Agreement (including with respect to any Transaction) without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n(b) As used in this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d specifically excludes any information that: (i) has been or becomes publicly available or is now, or in the future, in the public domain in each case without any breach of this Agreement; (ii) prior to disclosure to Receiving Party hereunder, is within the possession of Receiving Party without any obligation of confidentiality; (iii) subsequent to disclosure hereunder, is lawfully received from a third party having rights therein without restriction of such third party\u2019s or Receiving Party\u2019s right to disseminate such information, and without notice of any restriction against its further disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed by Receiving Party by way of persons or entities which have not used, referenced or had access to (directly or indirectly) Confidential Information.\n(c) ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY ORCC UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d. ORCC MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR UTILITY OF ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n2. Use. Restriction of Confidential Information. ORCC will disclose certain Confidential Information to Receiving Party solely for the mutually acknowledged purpose recited above, and Receiving Party shall use such Confidential Information only for such purpose. Except to the extent expressly permitted under this Agreement, Receiving Party shall not disclose, disseminate or cause or permit any disclosure or unauthorized use of any Confidential Information, nor shall Receiving Party make any copies, reproductions, summaries or excerpts of any Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall not use any Confidential Information, including, without limitation, any Technical Information, as a basis for developing, marketing or providing products or services that compete (whether directly or indirectly) with the products or services that ORCC sells, markets or provides to its customers. Receiving Party shall at all times protect Confidential Information, using at minimum those measures that it takes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature (provided that such measures are consistent with at least a reasonable degree of care); provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve Receiving Party of its liability for unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information. In the event Receiving Party loses or causes an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, it will notify ORCC promptly after becoming aware of such disclosure, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the retrieval and return of such Confidential Information. Any delay or failure by ORCC to enforce its rights in the event of any breach of this Agreement shall not be construed to constitute a waiver or release of its rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breach.\n3. Permitted Disclosure. Receiving Party may only disclose Confidential Information provided to it by ORCC hereunder to Receiving Party\u2019s officers, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, legal counsel, financial advisors and other duly authorized agents and consultants (its \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) each of whom Receiving Party reasonably determines need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of assisting the Receiving Party in its evaluation of a Transaction as set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that Receiving Party shall, prior to disclosing Confidential Information to one or more Representatives in each instance, inform such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and instruct them to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n4. Required Disclosure. Except as provided elsewhere in this Section 4, if a Party determines in good faith that it is required under applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information of a type referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 1(a) (such Confidential Information \u201cTechnical Information\u201d), such Party shall give the other Party prompt notice of such fact so that the other Party may obtain a protective order or any other appropriate remedy concerning any such disclosure and/or waive compliance with the nondisclosure requirements of this Agreement. The disclosing Party will reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with the other Party\u2019s efforts to obtain any such order or other remedy. If any such order or other remedy does not fully preclude disclosure, or if the other Party waives such compliance, the disclosing Party may make such disclosure, to the extent that the disclosing Party determines in good faith that such disclosure is required under applicable law or legal process, and the disclosing Party will use its best efforts to have confidential treatment accorded to the disclosed Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may publicly disclose (i) Confidential Information of the type set forth in clause (iv) of Section 1 (a) above and (ii) the fact that the Parties are or have been discussing a proposed Transaction and/or the terms of such proposed Transaction, in each case, only if and to the extent that the Receiving Party determines in good faith based on an opinion of legal counsel that it is required to do so under applicable law or subpoena or other legal process in connection with a Transaction, provided that the Receiving Party furnishes a copy of the proposed disclosure ORCC not less than five business days prior to such disclosure (unless the disclosing Party determines in good faith that it is not reasonably practicable to give such advance notice) and considers in good faith ORCC\u2019s comments on such proposed disclosure. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement is not intended to restrict Receiving Party from making any public or private proposal or offer to acquire ORCC or its securities for all cash consideration, or from making such public disclosure in connection therewith as Receiving Party may determine in good faith based on an opinion of legal counsel to be required in accordance with the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ORCC may publicly disclose the fact that the Parties are or have been discussing a proposed Transaction and/or the terms of such proposed Transaction only if and to the extent that it determines in good faith that it is required to do so under applicable law or legal process in connection with a Transaction, provided that ORCC gives the Receiving Party notice thereof three business days prior to such disclosure unless ORCC determines in good faith that it is not reasonably practicable to give such advance notice.\n5. Term of Obligations: Return of Confidential Information. This Agreement shall control and govern all Confidential Information disclosed by ORCC to Receiving Party from and after the Effective Date (as defined above) for a period of one (1) year (the \u201cTerm\u201d) unless earlier terminated by the Parties in a separate agreement or instrument executed by both Parties. Promptly upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or with respect to Technical Information only, upon. ORCC\u2019s reasonable written request, Receiving Party shall return or destroy all written material (if any) containing or reflecting any Confidential Information.

(the \u201cRecipient\u201d or \u201cJAM\u201d). The Company and the Recipient are sometimes referred to in this Agreement individually as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\nRECITALS\nA. The Company desires to exchange views and information with JAM, its largest shareholder.\nB. The Company intends to provide JAM access to certain non-public, confidential or proprietary information concerning the Company.\nC. In order to induce the Company to provide access to the Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined), the Recipient hereby agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:\nARTICLE I\nDEFINITIONS\nSection 1.1 Certain Definitions. In addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms used in this Agreement shall be construed to have the meanings set forth or referenced below:\nThe term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d refers to (i) all business or financial information (including business plans, budgets, forecasts and financial projections) of the Company or its subsidiaries (or of others having business relationships with the Company), or concerning the Matter, whether or not marked or otherwise identified as confidential or proprietary, (ii) any other information or materials marked or designated as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d by the Company at the time of its disclosure to the Recipient and\n(iii) any other information or materials that the Company maintains as confidential or that is proprietary to the Company, the nature of which or the circumstances surrounding the disclosure of which would indicate to a reasonable person that such information or materials are confidential or proprietary. The foregoing information and materials shall be \u201cConfidential Information\u201d whether evidenced, transferred or transmitted in writing, orally, visually, electronically or by any other means, and whether disclosed before or after the date of this Agreement. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall also include all Derivative Materials.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include information that\n(A) is or becomes generally available to the public other than\nas a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient; or (B) is or becomes available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from any source other than the Company or its Representatives, which source has represented to the Recipient (and that the Recipient reasonably believes after due inquiry) that such source is entitled to disclose such information without the Recipient being bound by any obligation of confidentiality, provided that upon the Recipient becoming aware that such information is Confidential Information that the source was not entitled to disclose, this Agreement shall thereafter apply to such Confidential Information.\nThe term \u201cDerivative Materials\u201d refers to all summaries, analyses, compilations, data, studies or other documents prepared by the Recipient (i) containing, or based in whole or in part on, any Confidential Information provided by the Company or its Representatives, or (ii) reflecting the Recipient\u2019s review of the Company or the Recipient\u2019s interest in the Matter.\nThe term \u201cPerson\u201d refers to any natural person, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust or other legal entity. The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d refers to a Person\u2019s directors, officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and other agents and representatives.\nThe term \u201cRecipient\u201d shall include (i) the Recipient, (ii) its affiliates, subsidiaries, and divisions, (iii) any Person that directly or indirectly, through intermediaries or otherwise, controls or owns a controlling interest in the Recipient and (iv) the Representatives of any of the foregoing Persons.\nARTICLE II\nCONFIDENTIALITY\nSection 2.1 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Covenants. As a condition to the Company\u2019s disclosure of the Confidential Information to the Recipient, the Recipient hereby covenants and agrees that all Confidential Information will be kept confidential by the Recipient and will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, be disclosed by the Recipient, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and will not be used by the Recipient, directly or indirectly, for any purpose other than facilitating discussion with the Company. Moreover, the Recipient agrees to transmit the Confidential Information to only those Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of facilitating the Recipient\u2019s discussion with the Company and who are informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and the Recipient agrees that it will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that (i) the Confidential Information being furnished may contain or may itself be material, non-public information concerning the Company, and (ii) securities laws in the United States prohibit any person who has received material, non-public information concerning the Company or the matters which are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities of the Company or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.

Any disclosure made pursuant to the prior sentence shall be no more extensive than is necessary to meet the minimum requirement imposed on the Person making such disclosure.\nSection 2.3 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that the Recipient is requested (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigate demand or similar process) to disclose any part of the Confidential Information, the Recipient shall notify the Company promptly of such request(s), and the documents requested thereby, so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive in writing the Recipient\u2019s obligation not to disclose the Confidential Information. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Recipient is nonetheless compelled to disclose all or part of the Confidential Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty from any tribunal or governmental or similar authority, the Recipient may disclose such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed without liability hereunder; provided, however, that the Recipient shall deliver to the Company written notice of the Confidential Information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at the Company\u2019s expense) to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information to any regulatory agency in the normal course of an examination, audit or investigation involving the Recipient.\nSection 2.4 Document Disposition.

The restrictions imposed on the disclosure of Confidential Information shall continue until the lesser of such time as the information disclosed hereunder is no longer Confidential Information and one (1) year from the date first written above, provided, that no such termination shall relieve Recipient from any liability relating to any prior breach of this Agreement.\nARTICLE III\nCOVENANT OF THE COMPANY\nSection 3.1 Information and Access. The Company will provide JAM access to certain non-public, confidential or proprietary information about the Company (the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) and receive and consider JAM\u2019s input on the financial services industry, market conditions and trends and the Company\u2019s operational performance, opportunities and direction.\nARTICLE IV\nTERM AND TERMINATION\nSection 4.1 Term.

The parties contemplate that JAM will file with the SEC an amendment to its Schedule 13D with respect to the Company attaching this Agreement and that the Company will file with the SEC a current report on Form 8-K attaching this Agreement.\nSection 5.2 Compliance with Securities Laws. As of the date hereof and during the Term of the Agreement, JAM is and will remain in compliance with all applicable state and federal securities laws with regard to its investment in the Company and its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nSection 5.3 Compliance with Banking Laws.

The Recipient agrees that due to the nature of this Agreement and the Confidential Information, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient and that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy of the Company for any breach by the Recipient of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity. The Recipient hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.\nSection 5.5 Expenses. The Parties will pay their own expenses with respect to this Agreement.\nSection 5.6 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained in this Agreement shall not be in any way impaired thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the Parties hereto shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. If any court determines that any of the provisions of this Agreement, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the duration or scope of such provision, the duration or scope of such provision, as the case may be, shall be reduced so that such provision becomes enforceable and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced.\nSection 5.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed within such state, without giving effect to any choice of law principles.\nSection 5.8 Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and it replaces and supersedes all prior agreements between the Parties. No provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended unless such waiver or amendment is in writing. No failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Recipient, by operation of law or otherwise, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent.\nSection 5.9 Execution. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by facsimile signatures, each of which shall be an original document, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n{Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank}\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have entered into this Agreement as of the date first written above.\nCOMPANY:\nHF Financial Corp.\n/s/ Michael Vekich\nName: Michael Vekich\nTitle: Chairman\nRECIPIENT:\nJACOBS ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC\n/s/ Sy Jacobs\nName: Sy Jacobs\nTitle: Managing Member\n"",

Maintaining Privileges.\nIf any Evaluation Material (including Evaluation Material related to pending or threatened litigation) includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege, you understand and agree that you and the Company have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of each party to this Confidentiality Agreement that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material provided to you that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Confidentiality Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.\n8. Not a Transaction Agreement.\nYou understand and agree that no contract or agreement providing for a Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until you and the Company execute and deliver a final definitive agreement relating to a Transaction (a \u201cTransaction Agreement\u201d), and you hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Transaction unless and until you and the Company shall have executed and delivered a Transaction Agreement. You also agree that, unless and until you and the Company shall have executed and delivered a Transaction Agreement, neither you nor the Company will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Transaction by virtue of this Confidentiality Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein.

No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose.\nYou understand and acknowledge that the Company and its Affiliates and representatives have made and make no representation hereunder, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, expressly disclaim any and all liability for the information contained in or omitted from the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of the Company and shall have no liability to you, your Affiliates or the Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. The parties agree that the Company will only be liable for any representations or warranties which are made in a Transaction Agreement, when, as, and if executed and delivered, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Confidentiality Agreement shall be construed as obligating the Company to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person. It is expected that you will conduct your own independent investigation of the Company and rely upon such investigation in making an investment decision regarding the Company.\n10.

In connection with the Possible Transaction, which may involve stock or other securities issued by you, you are prepared to make available to the Company certain information concerning you and your business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities. The party disclosing information shall be referred to herein as the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and the party receiving information shall be referred to as the \u201cReceiving Party.\u201d\nAs a condition to each Receiving Party and their Representatives (as defined below) being furnished with such information, the Receiving Party agrees to treat any information concerning the Disclosing Party (whether prepared by the Disclosing Party, its Representatives or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication) which is furnished to the Receiving Party or its Representatives now or in the future by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party (collectively, the \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d) and Discussion Information (as defined below) confidential in accordance with the provisions of this letter agreement, and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth. As used in this letter agreement, a party\u2019s \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall include the directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates (as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c1934 Act\u201d)), partners, advisors or representatives of such party and those of its subsidiaries, affiliates and/or divisions (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers, financial advisors and any Representatives of the Receiving Party\u2019s advisors).\nThe term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d shall be deemed to include any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, forecasts, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives that derive from, contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to the Receiving Party or its Representatives pursuant hereto.\nThe term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d shall also be deemed to include any oral, written or visual information obtained by meeting Representatives of the Disclosing Party or touring any of its facilities. The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, (ii) was within your possession prior to its being furnished to you by or on behalf of the Company; provided that the source of such information was not known to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any other party with respect to such information, (iii) was developed independently by the Receiving Party without use, directly or indirectly, of any Evaluation Material or (iv) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives, provided that such source was not known to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company or any other party with respect to such information.\nExcept as otherwise permitted hereunder, the Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and for no other purpose, that the Evaluation Material and the Discussion Information (as defined below) will be kept confidential and that the Receiving Party and its Representatives will not disclose any of the Evaluation Material or the Discussion Information in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) the Receiving Party may make any disclosure of the Evaluation Material or the Discussion Information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent, and (ii) the Receiving Party may make any disclosure of the Evaluation Material or the Discussion Information to such of its Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of assisting the Receiving Party in its evaluation of a Possible Transaction, are provided with a copy of this letter agreement, agree to keep the Evaluation Material and the Discussion Information confidential and agree to be bound by the terms of this letter agreement to the same extent as if they were parties hereto. In any event, the Receiving Party agrees to undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the Discussion Information, the Receiving Party hereby accepts responsibility for any breach of this letter agreement by any of its Representatives (it being understood that such responsibility shall be in addition to and not by way of limitation of any right or remedy that the Company may have against such Representatives), and the Receiving Party agrees at its sole expense to take all reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or uses of the Evaluation Material and the Discussion Information. The Receiving Party understands that some Evaluation Material relating to customers and customer contracts may, and Evaluation Material related to product pricing shall, if provided, be designated for review solely by the Receiving Party\u2019s outside advisors or by those of the Receiving Party\u2019s employees whose responsibilities do not include contacting customers or potential customers of the Receiving Party\u2019s institutional pharmacy business or in the determination of product pricing for the Receiving Party\u2019s institutional pharmacy business, and the Receiving Party agrees to, and to cause its Representatives to, abide by such designation.\nIn addition, the Receiving Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party and its Representatives will not disclose to any other person the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available to the Receiving Party and its Representatives, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto, including the status thereof and the identity of the parties thereto (collectively, the \u201cDiscussion Information\u201d); provided that, in the event the Receiving Party becomes obligated to make public disclosure of Discussion Information pursuant to its obligations under 1934 Act or any other applicable law, rule or regulation, the Receiving Party shall, except as otherwise consented to by the Disclosing Party, limit such disclosure to the minimum disclosure so required and, without limiting the foregoing, to the extent the Receiving Party has any discretion with respect thereto, the Receiving Party shall not disclose any possible terms or of any possible transaction involving the Disclosing Party. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this letter agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.

If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of outside counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material or Discussion Information to any tribunal, the Receiving Party or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Material or Discussion Information which such counsel advises the Receiving Party is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Receiving Party uses reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the Discussion Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Evaluation Material and the Discussion Information by such tribunal at the Disclosing Party\u2019s expense.\nThe Receiving Party recognizes and acknowledges the competitive value of the Evaluation Material and the damage that could result to the Disclosing Party if the Evaluation Material were used or disclosed except as authorized by this letter.\nIn the event that either party decides not to proceed with a Possible Transaction, such party will promptly inform the Company of that decision. Upon the request of the Disclosing Party in its sole discretion and for any reason, the Receiving Party will as directed by the Disclosing Party promptly (and in no event later than five business days after the request therefor) deliver to the Disclosing Party or destroy all Evaluation Material and Discussion Information (and any copies thereof) and cause its Representatives to do the same and the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with written confirmation of destruction; provided that outside counsel to the Receiving Party may retain one copy of the Evaluation Material in confidential restricted access files for use only in the event a dispute arises between the parties hereunder and only if reasonably related to such dispute.

The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Receiving Party or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding any transactions contemplated hereby, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\nIn consideration of the Evaluation Material being furnished to the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party hereby agrees that, for a period of one year from the date hereof, neither the Receiving Party nor any of its Representatives will solicit to employ (i) any of the officers of the Disclosing Party or (ii) any of the employees of the Disclosing Party with whom the Receiving Party has contact or who are specifically identified to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing party or any of its Representatives for purposes hereof during the period of the Receiving Party\u2019s investigation of the Disclosing Party, in either case without obtaining the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may engage in general solicitations for employees in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice and that the Receiving Party may solicit or employ any employee of the Disclosing Party six months after such party\u2019s employment has been terminated by the Disclosing Party.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that it is aware (and that its Representatives are aware or, prior to receipt of any Evaluation Material or Discussion Information, will be advised by the Receiving Party) of the restrictions imposed by the United States federal securities laws on a person possessing material non-public information about a public company and that the Receiving Party and its Representatives will comply with such laws.\nSubject to the following paragraph, you agree that, for a period of one year from the date of this letter agreement, unless specifically invited in writing by the Company, neither you nor any of your Representatives will in any manner, directly or indirectly: (a) effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or participate in, facilitate or encourage any other person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, (i) any acquisition of any securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or rights or options to acquire any securities (or beneficial ownership thereof), or any assets, indebtedness or businesses of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided that this paragraph shall not restrict your Representatives or any benefit plan that is maintained for your or your Representatives\u2019 employees from acquiring up to an aggregate of two percent (2%) of the outstanding common stock of the Company solely for investment purposes or restrict you or your Representatives from acquiring assets from the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business so long as, in either such case, such acquisition is not related to or in furtherance of any other activities by any other person that is restricted by any other provision of this paragraph, (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving the Company, any of the subsidiaries or assets of the Company or the subsidiaries constituting a significant portion of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, (iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the Company, including soliciting consents or taking other action with respect to the calling of a special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders; (b) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under the 1934 Act) with respect to the Company; or (c) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek representation on or to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company or to obtain representation on the Board of Directors of the Company. You also agree during such period not to request the Company or any of its Representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence).\nThe preceding paragraph notwithstanding, (1) you will not be deemed to be in breach of either of clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of the preceding paragraph by virtue of the maintenance, amendment and/or extension by you or your affiliates of the Offer made by and referred to in the Supplement to the Offer to Purchase (the \u201cSupplement\u201d) filed as an exhibit to Amendment No. 28 to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed by you and Nectarine Acquisition Corp. with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 16, 2005) or the announcement, commencement or maintenance by you or your affiliates of a new acquisition offer, whether by way of a tender or exchange offer, merger or otherwise (a \u201cNew Offer\u201d); provided that the terms of the Offer or the New Offer (including any extension or amendment thereof) shall in no event (A) provide for a per share consideration that is less than the Offer price in effect on the date of this letter agreement or (B) otherwise contain terms and conditions that are less favorable in any material respect to the Company\u2019s shareholders than the terms and conditions set forth in the Supplement (an Offer or New Offer made and/or maintained in good faith and meeting the terms of this proviso, a \u201cStatus Quo Offer\u201d); (2) you will not be deemed to be in breach of any other provision of the preceding paragraph by virtue of the taking of any action otherwise prohibited by such provisions so long as any such action is taken during the time that such Status Quo Offer is pending and open; and (3) (A) if the Company has entered into or enters into any confidentiality agreement in connection with providing any Evaluation Material to any other person, and such other confidentiality agreement (including any amendments thereto) either (i) does not contain a standstill provision or (ii) contains less restrictive provisions than those specified in the immediately preceding paragraph, then the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to be automatically modified without further action by either party so that the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph are no less favorable to you than those applicable to such third party and (B) if the Company enters into a binding agreement with another person for a merger or business combination transaction as a result of which the Company\u2019s shareholders immediately prior to such transaction would own less than a majority of the voting securities of the combined company following such acquisition or business combination, then the restrictions on you set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to automatically terminate without further action by either party. During the course of the Receiving Party\u2019s evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to the financial advisors for the Disclosing Party or employees or representatives of the Disclosing Party specified by the Disclosing Party. Accordingly, the Receiving Party agrees not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any officer, director, employee, agent, customer or creditor of the Disclosing Party concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the prior consent of the Disclosing Party.\nEach party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Possible Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered.

It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\nIt is further understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this letter agreement by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives and that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including, without limitation, injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by the Receiving Party of this letter agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party further agrees not to raise as a defense or objection to the request or granting of such relief that any breach of this agreement is or would be compensable by an award of money damages and agree to waive any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.\nThis letter agreement is for the benefit of the Disclosing Party (and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates), and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within the State of New York. Each party also hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and each party agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts, and further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party\u2019s address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against the party in any such court).

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) and Nuance Communications, Inc. (\u201cNuance\u201d) (a \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d) each of the parties (each a \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d as applicable) is prepared to make available to the other (each a \u201cRecipient\u201d as applicable) and its Representatives (as hereinafter defined) certain information concerning its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities. As a condition to such information being furnished, the Recipient agrees to treat any information which is furnished to it or to its Representatives by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party (herein collectively referred to as the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) in accordance with the provisions of this letter agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth. As used in this Agreement, a party\u2019s \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall include the directors, officers, employees, agents, partners or advisors of such party and those of its parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors).\n(1) Confidential Information. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d also shall be deemed to include the portion of all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by Recipient or its Representatives that contain Confidential Information. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Recipient or its Representatives, (ii) was within Recipient\u2019s possession prior to its being furnished to it by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant hereto, provided that the source of such information was not known by Recipient to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Disclosing Party with respect to such information, (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient or (iv) becomes available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information.\n(2) Use of Confidential Information. Recipient and its Representatives shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and for no other purpose. Recipient agrees that the Confidential Information will be kept confidential and that Recipient and its Representatives will not disclose any of the Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) it may make any disclosure of the Confidential Information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent, and (ii) any of the Confidential Information may be disclosed to Recipient\u2019s Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction, who are bound by confidentiality obligations to Recipient or agree to keep such Confidential Information confidential to the same extent as Recipient. In any event, Recipient agrees to undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential\nInformation, to accept responsibility for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives, and at its sole expense to take all reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or uses of the Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party understands that Recipient may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties, that may be similar to Disclosing Party\u2019s information. Accordingly, this Agreement will not be construed as an obligation or representation that Recipient will not develop products or systems, or have products or systems developed for it, that compete with the products or systems contemplated by Disclosing Party\u2019s information. In addition, the Disclosing Party agrees that Recipient does not intend to, and will not be obligated to, restrict or segregate the work assignments of personnel who may have been exposed to Disclosing Party\u2019s information.\n(3) Non-Disclosure. In addition, both parties agree that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person the fact that the Confidential Information has been made available to it, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (whether written or oral), including the status thereof (collectively, the \u201cDiscussion Information\u201d); provided, however that a party may make such disclosure if, and solely to the extent that, the other party has already done so or such party has received the written opinion of its outside counsel that such disclosure must be made in order that such party not commit a violation of law. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\n(4) Required Disclosure. In the event that Recipient or any of its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information, Recipient shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, Recipient or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, in the written opinion of counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information or Discussion Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that Recipient exercises its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and the Discussion Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information and the Discussion Information by such tribunal.\n(5) Termination of Discussions.

Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. Recipient agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to Recipient or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties that are made in a final definitive agreement regarding any transactions contemplated hereby, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n(7) Definitive Agreements. Both parties understand and agree that no contract or agreement providing for any Possible Transaction shall be deemed to exist between Nuance and the Company unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered. Both parties also agree that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither the Company nor Nuance will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other or any of its Representatives with regard to a Possible Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.\n(8) Term. The Term of this Agreement commences on the date first set forth above and extends for a period of three (3) years thereafter unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.\n(9) No Waiver. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Disclosing Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n(10) Injunctive Relief. It is further understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or any of its Representatives and that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by the Recipient of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Disclosing Party.\n(11) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within Massachusetts.\n(12) No Modification. This Agreement may not be modified or discharged in whole or in part except by an agreement in writing signed by both parties.\n(13) No Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except in the case of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets, stock or business of such party.\n(14) Entire Agreement.

Definitions.\n(a) The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means information concerning the Provider which has been or is furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives in connection with the Recipient\u2019s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives to the extent they contain or are based upon the information furnished by the Provider hereunder.

In that case, or at any time upon the request of a Provider for any reason, a Recipient will, and will cause its Representatives to, within five business days of receipt of such notice, destroy or return all Evaluation Material, except for that portion of notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents or records prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives which does not contain in any respect any of the Evaluation Materials, in any way relating to the Provider or its products, services, employees or other assets or liabilities, and no copy or extract thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained, except that Recipient\u2019s outside legal counsel may retain one copy to be kept confidential and used solely for the purpose of establishing Recipient\u2019s compliance with its obligations hereunder.

The parties wish to undertake negotiations relating to the Transaction and the exchange of Evaluation Material while maintaining the confidential nature of the pendency of such negotiations and the Evaluation Material both during and after such negotiations are concluded and as a condition to each party furnishing information to the other party, each party agrees to enter into this Agreement;\n NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and any access of the Receiving Party to Evaluation Material of the Disclosing Party, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n 1. Evaluation Material. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" also shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by each party or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to such party or its Representatives pursuant hereto which is not available to the general public. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, (ii) was within the Receiving Party's possession prior to its being furnished to the Receiving Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Receiving Party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the Receiving Party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information, or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of Evaluation Material.\n 2. Use of Evaluation Material. Each party hereby agrees that it and its Representatives shall use the other's Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction between the parties, and that the Disclosing Party's Evaluation Material will be kept confidential and each party and its Representatives will not disclose or use for purposes other than the evaluation of a Transaction any of the other's Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever, provided, however, that (i) the Receiving Party may make any disclosure of such information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of such information may be disclosed to the Receiving Party's Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction between the parties, who are provided with a copy of this Agreement and who are directed by the Receiving Party to treat such information as confidential and agrees to treat such Evaluation Material in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n 3. Securities Laws. Each party acknowledges that it is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information concerning the matters which are the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n 4. Non-Disclosure. In addition, each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, its Representatives will not disclose to any other person the fact that any Evaluation Material has been made available hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof) provided, that a party may make such disclosure if in the written opinion of a party's outside legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law. In such event, such party shall use its best efforts to give advance notice to the other party.\n 5. Required Disclosure. In the event that a party or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the other party's Evaluation Material or the fact that such Evaluation Material has been made available to such party or that discussions are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms or conditions or other facts related thereto, the party requested or required to make the disclosure shall provide the other party with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by such other party, the party requested or required to make the disclosures or any of its Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel (which counsel shall be independent legal counsel selected by counsel to the party requested or required to make disclosure and reasonably acceptable to counsel to the other party if such disclosure is requested or required in connection with a matter in which the parties hereto are adverse or relates to information that is reasonably likely to be utilized in or relevant to a matter in which the parties hereto have or may reasonably be expected to have adverse interests), legally compelled to disclose the other party's Evaluation Material to any tribunal, the party requested or required to make the disclosure or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the other party's Evaluation Material which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the party requested or required to make the disclosure exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the other party's Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the other party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the other party's Evaluation Material by such tribunal.\n 6. Termination of Negotiations. If either party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Transaction with the other party, the party so deciding will promptly inform the other party of that decision by giving a written notice of termination of negotiations. In that case, or at any time upon the request of either Disclosing Party for any reason, each Receiving Party will promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party or destroy all written Evaluation Material (and all copies thereof and extracts therefrom) furnished to the Receiving Party or its Representatives by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant hereto and such destruction shall be certified in writing by an authorized officer supervising such destruction. In the event of such a decision or request, all other Evaluation Material prepared by the requesting party shall be destroyed, no copy thereof shall be retained and such destruction shall be certified in writing by an authorized officer supervising such destruction, and in no event shall either party be obligated to disclose or provide the Evaluation Material prepared by it or its Representatives to the other party. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, upon any termination of negotiations, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and all other obligations hereunder.\n 7. No Representation of Accuracy. Each party understands and acknowledges that neither party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material made available by it or to it. Each party agrees that neither party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the other party or to any of its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of or reliance upon such other party's Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding the Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.\n 8. Definitive Agreements. Each party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Transaction involving the parties shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered. Each party also agrees that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Transaction between the parties has been executed and delivered, neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \""definitive agreement\"" does not include an executed letter of intent, term sheet or any other preliminary written agreement.\n 9. Non-Solicitation. BBY agrees that for a period of fifteen (15) months from the date hereof (the \""Restricted Period\""), without the prior written consent of the Company, neither its officers, any other employee of BBY authorized to recruit employees for BBY nor its directors will directly or indirectly solicit to employ any exempt (salaried) non-store employee of the Company who is employed at the level of director or above (each a \""Restricted Employee\""); provided, however, that in the absence of prior contact with a Restricted Employee during the Restricted Period, general recruitment advertising or communications to which such Restricted Employee responds shall not be considered a solicitation for purposes of this Section 9. In addition, BBY agrees that during the Restricted Period, BBY shall not employ any Restricted Employee BBY solicited for employment during the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date hereof.\n 10. Exclusive Dealing. In order to cause BBY to be willing to spend the time and incur the expense necessary to conduct due diligence and undertake negotiations related to the Transaction, the Company agrees that it will not, and will not permit any director, officer, authorized employee, agent or other representative of the Company to, negotiate, solicit or encourage, or (subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of Directors), respond to any inquiries (other than a response that merely defers a substantive response until after the expiration of the Exclusivity Period, as defined below) or requests for non-public information relating to, any proposal for the combination of the Company with any other party or sale or other disposition of the Company or a substantial portion of its assets (whether by means of a negotiated sale of securities or assets, tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, recapitalization, restructuring or other transaction) (collectively referred to herein as a \""Sale\"") with or from any other party from and after the date hereof through and including the earlier of (a) the date upon which BBY gives notice, in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement, to the Company that it does not wish to proceed with a Transaction, or (b) October 6, 2000 (the \""Exclusivity Period\"").\n In addition, the Company agrees that it will immediately cease from the date hereof through the end of the Exclusivity Period any existing negotiations with any party other than BBY or its affiliates in respect of a Sale. The Company will promptly notify Richard Zona if it receives, at any time during the Exclusivity Period, any offers, proposals, inquiries or requests for non-public information concerning a Sale. If Mr. Zona determines in his reasonable discretion that any such offer, proposal, inquiry or request for information is likely to result in an Other Offer (as defined below), then the Company shall immediately notify BBY of such offer, proposal, inquiry or request for information. For purposes of this Section 10, an \""Other Offer\"" shall mean an unsolicited offer concerning a Sale received by the Company during the Exclusivity Period which, pursuant to its fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors of the Company concludes, after receiving the advice of outside counsel and financial advisers, that it must consider and respond to prior to the expiration of the Exclusivity Period. The Company may consider and respond to an Other Offer prior to the expiration of the Exclusivity Period provided it (i) promptly advises BBY of the receipt of such Other Offer and the Board's conclusions with respect thereto, (ii) promptly advises BBY of the terms of such Other Offer, including the identity of the offeror, and (iii) considers at the same meeting at which such Other Offer is to be considered any amended offer submitted by BBY for consideration by the Company's Board of Directors. Nothing contained in this Section 10 shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to an Other Offer as contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n In connection with any such Other Offer, the Company will only provide information to such third party if such third party has executed a confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form as the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, and BBY is provided with copies of all information given to the other party which was not previously provided to BBY. The Company will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party unless and until the parties hereto have terminated their negotiations pursuant to Section 6 above. In consideration of the Company's agreement hereto, BBY agrees to diligently pursue its due diligence review during the Exclusivity Period and agrees further to notify the Company within forty-eight (48) hours of any determination not to proceed with a transaction as contemplated by the parties.\n 11. Future Conduct of BBY. BBY agrees that until the expiration of one (1) year from the date the Exclusivity Period expires, and except with the express written consent of the Company, neither BBY nor any of its directors or executive officers shall: (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 3% in the aggregate of any equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger or business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to purchase, directly or indirectly, a material portion of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any \""solicitation of proxies\"" (as such term is used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \""group\"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (v) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing, or (vii) advise, assist or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing.\n 12. Waiver. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n 13. Miscellaneous. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. No failure or delay by either party or any of its Representatives in exercising any right, power or privileges under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder, and the non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either party or any of its Representatives have breached this Agreement, then the breaching party shall be liable and pay to the non-breaching party the reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with such litigation, including an appeal therefrom. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability, of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.\n 14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Minnesota, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Venue for any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement shall be properly laid in any state or federal court in the State of Minnesota.\n 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n MUSICLAND STORES CORPORATION\n By: /s/ JACK W.

Permitted Disclosures.\n(a) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 1 above:\n(i) the Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if and to the extent that the Disclosing Party consents in writing (including without limitation email from a senior executive of the Disclosing Party) to the Recipient\u2019s disclosure thereof;\n(ii) the Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any Representative of the Recipient, but only to the extent such Representative (A) reasonably needs to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of helping the Recipient consider, evaluate or negotiate a possible transaction between the Parties, and (B) has been provided with a copy of this Agreement, has been instructed to abide by the provisions hereof and is under an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information; and\n(iii) subject to Section 3(c) below, the Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent required by applicable law or governmental regulation or by valid legal process.\n(b) [Reserved]\n(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 1 above, if the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives is required by law or governmental or other regulation or by subpoena or other valid legal process to disclose any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information to any Person, then the Recipient will promptly provide the Disclosing Party with written notice of the applicable law, regulation or process so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. The Recipient and its Representatives will cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party and the Disclosing Party\u2019s Representatives in any attempt by the Disclosing Party to obtain any such protective order or other remedy. If the Disclosing Party elects not to seek, or is unsuccessful in obtaining, any such protective order or other remedy in connection with any requirement that the Recipient disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, then the Recipient may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent legally required without liability hereunder;.\n4. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request (including without limitation email), the Recipient and the Recipient\u2019s Representatives will promptly deliver to the Disclosing Party any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information (and all copies thereof) obtained or possessed by the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives; provided, however, that, in lieu of delivering to the Disclosing Party any such Confidential Information, the Recipient may destroy such Confidential Information and deliver to the Disclosing Party a certificate confirming its destruction. Notwithstanding the delivery to the Disclosing Party (or the destruction by the Recipient) of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party pursuant to this Section 4, the Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by their confidentiality obligations and other obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient shall be permitted to retain a copy of Recipient Work Product (as that term is defined in Section 11(b) below) for archival and dispute resolution purposes, however, any such retained Recipient Work Product shall continue to be subject to the confidentiality and non-use obligations set forth herein for so long as such Recipient retains such Recipient Work Product.\n5. Limitation on Soliciting Employees. During the nine (9) month period commencing on the Effective Date, neither Party nor any of such Party\u2019s Representatives will directly or indirectly solicit for employment, hire or induce or encourage (in each case, other than by means of a general solicitation pursuant to a newspaper or other media advertisement or other customary means by such party in the ordinary course of its business) any Covered Person (as defined herein) to terminate his or her relationship with the other Party or any subsidiary or other affiliate of said other Party in order to become an employee, consultant or independent contractor of or to any other Person. For purposes of this letter agreement, \u201cCovered Person\u201d shall mean any Person who is an employee of a Party or any subsidiary or other affiliate of such Party as of the Effective Date or who becomes an employee of such Party or of any subsidiary or other affiliate of such Party before the termination of discussions regarding a possible transaction involving the Parties.\n6. Standstill Provision. During the one-year period commencing on the Effective Date (the \u201cStandstill Period\u201d), each Party (hereinafter a \u201cRestricted Party\u201d) agrees that it will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly:\n(a) make, effect, initiate, propose, cause, participate in or knowingly encourage (i) any acquisition of beneficial ownership of any securities of the other Party (\u201cOther Party\u201d) or any securities of any subsidiary of the Other Party, (ii) any acquisition of any material assets of the Other Party or the Other Party\u2019s subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business, (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business combination, recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or extraordinary transaction involving the Other Party or the Other Party\u2019s subsidiaries, or involving any securities or material assets of the Other Party or the Other Party\u2019s subsidiaries, or (iv) any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as those terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents with respect to any securities of the Other Party;\n(b) form or join a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder) with respect to the beneficial ownership of any securities of the Other Party;\n(c) act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control the management, board of directors or policies of the Other Party;\n(d) take any action that would reasonably be likely to require the Other Party to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in clause \u201c(a)\u201d of this sentence; or\n(e) enter into any arrangement or agreement with any other Person relating to any of the foregoing.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) at any time during the Standstill Period a binding definitive acquisition agreement is executed by the Other Party and a third party (other than the Partner or any affiliate of the Restricted Party) to effect (i) a merger, recapitalization or other business combination or transaction that, if consummated, would result in the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Other Party immediately prior to such merger or other business combination or transaction owning less than 50% of the outstanding voting power of such third party or the resulting entity immediately following such merger or other business combination or transaction, or (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Other Party (each such transaction, a \u201cChange of Control Transaction\u201d), or (B) at any time during the Standstill Period (1) an offer for a Change of Control Transaction that specifies a per share price is publicly announced by a third party, (2) the Restricted Party requests an opportunity to meet with the board of directors of the Other Party, and (3) the Other Party does not grant such request within seven days following the date thereof or thereafter continue such discussions in good faith, then the restrictions set forth in this Section 6 shall immediately terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect (it being understood that any good faith rejection by the Other Party of any offer or proposal made by the Restricted Party as part of such discussions shall not cause the restrictions set forth in this Section 6 to terminate). The expiration of the Standstill Period or the termination of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6 will not terminate or otherwise affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Restricted Party from making private communications to the board of directors of the Other Party, so long as such communications would not be reasonably be expected to require public disclosure.\n7. No Obligation to Pursue Transaction. Unless the Parties enter into a Definitive Agreement, no agreement providing for a transaction involving either of the Parties will be deemed to exist between the Parties, and neither Party will be under any obligation to negotiate or enter into any such agreement or transaction with the other Party. Each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion: (a) to conduct any process it deems appropriate with respect to any transaction or proposed transaction involving such Party and to modify any procedures relating to any such process without giving notice to the other Party or any other Person; (b) to reject any proposal made by the other Party or any of the other Party\u2019s Representatives with respect to a transaction involving such Party; and (c) to terminate discussions and negotiations with the other Party at any time. Each Party recognizes that, except as expressly provided in any binding written agreement between the Parties that is executed on or after the Effective Date: (i) the other Party and its Representatives will be free to negotiate with, and to enter into any agreement or transaction with, any other interested party; and (ii) such Party will not have any rights or claims against the other Party or any of the other Party\u2019s Representatives arising out of or relating to any transaction or proposed transaction involving the other Party.\n8. No Waiver. No failure or delay by either Party or any of its Representatives in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege under this Agreement. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended except by means of a written instrument that is validly executed on behalf of both of the Parties and that refers specifically to the particular provision or provisions being waived or amended.\n9. Remedies. Each Party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such Party or by any of such Party\u2019s Representatives and that the other Party is likely to suffer irreparable harm as a result of any such breach. Accordingly, each Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the other Party or any of the other Party\u2019s Representatives. The equitable remedies referred to above will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but rather will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Parties. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, (a) if a court of competent jurisdiction decides that there is a prevailing Party in such litigation, then the non-prevailing Party will pay to the prevailing Party the reasonable legal fees incurred by the prevailing Party in connection with such litigation (including any appeal relating thereto) or (b) if a court of competent jurisdiction (i) does not opine on whether there is a prevailing Party in such litigation and (ii) determines that either Party or any of its Representatives has breached this Agreement, such breaching Party will be liable for, and will pay to the other Party, the reasonable legal fees incurred by the other Party in connection with such litigation (including any appeal relating thereto).\n10. Successors and Assigns; Applicable Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Party and its Representatives and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws). Each Party: (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement; (b) agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the address set forth opposite the name of such Party at the end of this Agreement shall be effective service of process for any such action, suit or proceeding brought against such Party; (c) irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware; and (d) irrevocably and unconditionally waives the right to plead or claim, and irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to plead or claim, that any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is brought in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n11. Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d will be deemed to include only the following information disclosed by one Party (a \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) to the other Party (a \u201cRecipient\u201d):\n(a) any information (including any technology, know-how, patent application, test result, research study, business plan, budget, forecast or projection) relating directly or indirectly to the business of the Disclosing Party, any predecessor entity or any subsidiary or other affiliate of the Disclosing Party (whether prepared by the Disclosing Party or by any other Person and whether or not in written form) that is or that has been made available to the Recipient or any Representative of the Recipient by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party or any Representative of the Disclosing Party, regardless of the manner in which it was made available;\n(b) any memorandum, analysis, compilation, summary, interpretation, study, report or other document, record or material that is or has been prepared by or for the Recipient or any Representative of the Recipient to the extent that it contains, reflects, interprets or is based directly or indirectly upon any information of the type referred to in clause \u201c(a)\u201d of this sentence (\u201cRecipient Work Product\u201d);\n(c) the existence and terms of this Agreement, and the fact that information of the type referred to in clause \u201c(a)\u201d of this sentence has been made available to the Recipient or any of its Representatives; and\n(d) the fact that discussions or negotiations are or may be taking place with respect to a possible transaction involving the Parties, and the proposed terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such transaction, including the status thereof.\nHowever, a Disclosing Party\u2019s \u201cConfidential Information\u201d will not be deemed to include:\n(i) any information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a direct or indirect result of the disclosure of any of such information by the Recipient or by any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives in breach or in violation of this Agreement;\n(ii) any information that was in the Recipient\u2019s possession prior to the time it was first made available to the Recipient or any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party or any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Representatives as evidenced by the written records of Recipient, provided that the source of such information was not known to the Recipient to be bound by any contractual or other obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or to any other Person with respect to any of such information;\n(iii) any information that becomes available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Representatives, provided that such source is not known to the Recipient to be bound by any contractual or other obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or to any other Person with respect to any of such information; or\n(iv) is independently developed by the Recipient without use of or reference to any of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n12.

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, SAP and Company, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree to the following:\n1. In connection with an evaluation relating to a potential relationship, cooperation or transaction (the \u201cEvaluation\u201d), SAP and Company may deliver to each other, upon the execution of this Agreement, Confidential Information as defined below (the party disclosing such Confidential Information being the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and the party receiving such Confidential Information being the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\n2. As used herein, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all information furnished by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives (defined below) to the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is either designated in writing by the Disclosing Party as confidential or should be reasonably understood by the Receiving Party to be confidential, including but not limited to, information that is related to:\n(a) the business plans or operations of the Disclosing Party; (b) the research and development or investigations of the Disclosing Party;\n(c) the business of any customer or partner of the Disclosing Party; (d) the Disclosing Party\u2019s properties, employees, customers, finances, operations; (e) any information about or concerning any third party (which information was provided to the Disclosing Party subject to an applicable confidentiality obligation to such third party); (f) software and related documentation (\u201cDisclosing Party\u2019s Software\u201d) including but not limited to the following information regarding the Disclosing Party\u2019s Software: (i) computer software (object and source codes), programming techniques and programming concepts, methods of processing, system designs embodied in the Disclosing Party\u2019s Software; and (ii) discoveries, inventions, concepts, designs, flow charts, documentation, product specifications, application program interface specifications, techniques and processes relating to the Disclosing Party\u2019s Software; and (g) product offerings, content partners, product pricing, product availability, technical drawings, algorithms, processes, ideas, techniques, formulas, data, schematics, trade secrets, know-how, improvements, inventions (whether patentable or not), marketing plans, forecasts and strategies.\n3. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends which appear on the original. The Receiving Party: (a) shall take all reasonable steps (defined below) to keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential; (b) shall not disclose or reveal any Confidential Information to any person other than its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in the Evaluation or who otherwise need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of the Evaluation; (c) shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with the Evaluation; and (d) shall not disclose to any person (other than those of its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in the Evaluation or who otherwise need to know for the purpose of the Evaluation) any information about the Evaluation, or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto, including, without limitation, the fact that discussions are taking place with respect thereto or the status thereof, or the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to the Receiving Party or its Representatives. As used herein \u201creasonable steps\u201d means those steps the Receiving Party takes to protect its own similar proprietary and confidential information, which shall not be less than a reasonable standard of care. As used herein, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall mean (i) employees of the Receiving Party; (ii) attorneys, accountants, or other professional business advisors; and, additionally, (iii) employees of those entities directly or indirectly owned by the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives. Each party shall promptly advise the other party of any misuse of Confidential Information that may come to its attention.\n4. The above restrictions on the use or disclosure of the Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, or is lawfully received free of restriction from a third party having the right to furnish such Confidential Information; (b) has become generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) at the time of disclosure to the Receiving Party was known to such party free of restriction; or (d) the Disclosing Party agrees in writing is free of such restrictions.\n5. Neither party is required to disclose any particular information to the other and any disclosure is entirely voluntary and is not intended to be construed as: (a) granting rights by license or otherwise under any trademark, patent, copyright or other intellectual property right; (b) creating a commitment as to any product, including the development or functionality of any product; (c) soliciting any business or incurring any obligation not specified herein; or (d) prohibiting either party from associating themselves with competitors of the other party for purposes substantially similar to those involved herein.\n6. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict either party\u2019s right to develop, make, use, market, license or distribute products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information as long as it shall not thereby breach this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information. Further, either party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or work with Confidential Information disclosed hereunder; provided however that the Receiving Party shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as required by this Agreement. The term \u201cresiduals\u201d means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory by persons who have had access, as authorized in this Agreement, to the Confidential Information so long as such persons have not studied the information for the purpose of replicating the same from memory. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. However, the foregoing shall not be deemed to grant to either party a license under the other party\u2019s copyrights or patents.\n7. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Disclosing Party or the Evaluation, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party, unless prohibited by law, with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Disclosing Party (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy; (ii) to consult with the Receiving Party with respect to the Disclosing Party\u2019s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process; or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained in a timely manner, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, the Receiving Party or its Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and to require that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment.\n8. To the extent that any Confidential Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by a party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.\n9. Upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request, the Receiving Party shall (at the Receiving Party\u2019s election) promptly return or destroy (provided that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of the Receiving Party) all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or on intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in the Receiving Party\u2019s possession or in the possession of any Representative of the Receiving Party; provided, however: (i) that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Confidential Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered; (ii) that the Receiving Party shall not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Confidential Information held electronically in archive or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or backup policies; and (iii) that the Receiving Party shall not be obligated to return or destroy Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to retain a copy pursuant to applicable law, and further provided that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use reasonable measures to cause its employees not to, access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up.\n10. Each party acknowledges that neither it nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Confidential Information.\n11. Until a separate definitive agreement regarding a potential relationship or transaction has been executed by the parties, neither party shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to any proposal, term sheet, letter of intent, or draft agreement relating to any such potential relationship or transaction (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (a) may conduct the process that may or may not result in definitive agreement in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party); and (b) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties\u2019 consideration of the potential relationship or transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party and requesting that the other party return or destroy the Confidential Information as described above). Either party can end the discussions at any time, for any reason, and without liability to the other. Any business decision either party makes in anticipation of definitive agreements is at the sole risk of the party making the decision, even if the other party is aware of or has indicated approval of, such decision.\n12. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.\n13. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either party hereto, each party hereto shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the other party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n14. The Receiving Party acknowledges that neither the Disclosing Party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty regarding the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, any representation or warranty as to the completeness or accuracy of the Confidential Information.\n15. The Receiving Party will not directly or indirectly transfer any Confidential Information to any country, entity or person prohibited from obtaining such information by U.S. export laws and shall otherwise comply with all applicable U.S. export laws and regulations.\n16. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, other than such principles directing application of New York law. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.\n17. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto as to Confidential Information disclosed hereunder in connection with the Evaluation and merges all prior discussions between them relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the parties have entered into, or enter into in the future, other agreements which contain terms concerning ownership or use of work product of either party or software license provisions and rights, then this Agreement shall not supersede either party\u2019s rights and obligations as provided in such other agreements, unless such other agreement specifically provides otherwise. Neither party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of each of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives. Any waiver of a provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a subsequent waiver of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.

General. In connection with the consideration of a possible transaction (a \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d) between the Parties, each Party (in its capacity as a provider of information hereunder, a \u201cProvider\u201d) is prepared to make available to the other Party (in its capacity as a recipient of information hereunder, a \u201cRecipient\u201d) certain Evaluation Material (as defined in Section 2 below) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth.\n2. Definitions.\n(a) The term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means information concerning the Provider which has been or is furnished to the Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below) in connection with the Recipient\u2019s evaluation of a Possible Transaction, including its business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, and includes all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives which contain or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by the Provider hereunder. The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within the Recipient\u2019s possession prior to its being furnished to the Recipient by or on behalf of the Provider, (iii) is or becomes available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, (iv) Recipient can reasonably show was independently developed by the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives or (v) is intentionally released by Provider to a third party without any restriction as to use or disclosure.\n(b) The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d shall include the directors, officers, employees, agents, partners or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) of the Recipient or Provider, as applicable.\n(c) The term \u201cPerson\u201d includes the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.\n3. Use of Evaluation Material. Each Recipient shall use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and, subject to Section 5, will not disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to the Recipient\u2019s Representatives for the purpose of helping the Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction.\n4. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Subject to Section 5, each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, such Party will not, and will instruct its Representative not to, disclose to any other Person (i) that Evaluation Material has been exchanged between the Parties, (ii) that discussions or negotiations are taking place between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction or (iii) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to inhibit, impair or restrict the ability of Recipient or its Representatives from having discussions or negotiations with other persons relating to potential financing in connection with the Possible Transaction so long as each of such Persons agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n5. Legally Required Disclosure. If a Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, such Recipient shall, unless it is advised in good faith by its counsel that it is not legally permitted to do so, provide the Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Provider, a Recipient or any of its Representatives is advised in good faith by its counsel that it is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4, such Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which the Recipient or its Representatives is advised in good faith by its counsel is legally required to be disclosed.\n6. Termination of Discussions. If either Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Possible Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of that decision.

The Recipient shall provide to the Provider a certificate of compliance with this provision. Notwithstanding the destruction or retention of the Evaluation Material, the Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by such Recipient\u2019s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material.\n7. No Solicitation. Each Recipient agrees that, for eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, no person in its organization who receives or has access to the Evaluation Material or has knowledge about the Possible Transaction will, directly or indirectly, solicit, or cause the soliciting of, or assist or encourage others in the soliciting of, the employment or consulting services of any of the officers of a Provider or any of its subsidiaries or employees engaged in research and development for Provider or any of its subsidiaries or any other employee of the Provider or any if its subsidiaries with whom the Recipient has had contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction or of whom it has become aware as a result of its receipt of any Evaluation Material, so long as they are employed by the Provider or any of its subsidiaries and for two months thereafter (each, a \u201cCovered Employee\u201d). A Recipient is not prohibited from:\n(i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at any particular individual or the employees of the Provider or its subsidiaries generally, or (ii) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit individuals for employment on behalf of such Recipient (and soliciting any person identified by any such recruiting firm or organization) so long as such Recipient does not identify the individuals to be solicited by such recruiting firm or organization.

Further, the Parties agree that the (a) restrictions in this Agreement shall not prevent (i) any pension plan related to a Recipient or its subsidiaries from acquiring, or offering to acquire, securities of a Provider at any time or (ii) a Recipient\u2019s financial advisors from engaging in ordinary course brokerage or other transactions involving the securities of a Provider at any time to the extent such transactions are executed by or on behalf of customers other than such Recipient or its subsidiaries.\n9. Compliance with Securities Laws. Each Recipient agrees not to use any Evaluation Material of the Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.\n10. Not a Transaction Agreement.

Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n12. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed.\n13. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state.\n14. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.\n15. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n16.

Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. During the course of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, Employee agrees that Employee has or will continue to become knowledgeable about, or come to be in possession of, Confidential Information. If such Confidential Information were to be divulged or become known to any competitor of a Banking Organization, or to any other Person outside of a Banking Organization, or if Employee were to consent to be employed by any competitor of a Banking Organization, or to engage in competition with a Banking Organization, such Banking Organization will be harmed. In addition, Employee has or may develop relationships with Customers or Potential Customers so that the Confidential Information could be used to Solicit the business of such Customer or Potential Customer away from a Banking Organization.\nEmployee shall not, directly or indirectly, use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the benefit of a Banking Organization, and shall not directly or indirectly, disclose, communicate, deliver, exhibit or provide any Confidential Information to any Person, except other Employees or Agents of a Banking Organization who have a need to know such Confidential Information for a proper corporate or business purpose, as required in the normal course of Employee\u2019s service as an employee. Nothing in this Section 4, or any other provision of this Agreement, shall be construed to prohibit Employee from reporting conduct to, providing truthful information to, or participating in any investigation or proceeding brought or conducted by any federal or state government agency or self-regulatory organization.\nEmployee specifically acknowledges that the Confidential Information, whether reduced to writing or maintained electronically or in the mind or memory of Employee and, whether compiled by a Banking Organization and/or the Employee, derives independent economic value from not being readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, that reasonable efforts have been put forth by each Banking Organization to maintain the secrecy of such information, that such information is the sole property of such Banking Organization and that any retention and/or use of such information during or after Employee\u2019s employment with either Financial Institution (except in the course of performing the Employee\u2019s duties of employment with a Financial Institution and except as otherwise set forth above) constitutes a misappropriation of a Banking Organization\u2019s Confidential Information.\nEmployee agrees that all Confidential Information and all records, documents and materials relating to all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of a Banking Organization, and upon Employee\u2019s termination of employment, all such Confidential Information, whether in paper or electronic form, shall be returned to a Financial Institution in good condition, without Employee retaining a copy thereof, including, but not limited to, retaining an electronic copy on any electronic device regardless of whether such device is owned by Employee. At a Financial Institution\u2019s request, Employee shall provide written verification, under the penalties for perjury, of his/her compliance with this covenant.\n5. Non-Solicitation of Customers and Potential Customers. Employee acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of Employee\u2019s position with a Banking Organization, Employee has or will have advantageous familiarity and personal contacts with Customers and Potential Customers and will have advantageous familiarity with the business operations and affairs of a Banking Organization. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been or will be placed in a position that, were Employee to leave a Financial Institution to compete with the business of a Banking Organization, such entity from which the Employee departed would, upon violation of this Agreement, suffer irreparable harm and financial loss, as well as lost goodwill and Confidential Information. Therefore, in consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution (\u201cRestriction Period\u201d), for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee\u2019s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee\u2019s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:\na. Solicit, divert, or take away (or attempt to Solicit, divert or take away) any Banking and Financial Services to or from any Customer or Potential Customer; or\nb. advise, persuade or induce (or attempt to advise, persuade or induce) any Customer or Potential Customer to terminate, reduce, limit, or change the Customer\u2019s services or business relationship, or the Potential Customer\u2019s contemplated services or business relationship, with a Financial Institution; or\nc. directly provide Banking and Financial Services to, or directly accept Banking and Financial Services from, any Customer or Potential Customer.\nThis Agreement is not intended to prevent Employee from accepting employment with an organization that competes with the Banking Organizations by offering Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers. The Parties acknowledge that Employee may be associated with such an Organization and that such association may place Employee in a senior or supervisory role to those in the organization that have contact with Customers or Potential Customers. Employee shall not be in violation of this Agreement merely by engaging in such a role, which may include:\na. supervising those who provide Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers;\nb. engaging in credit review, underwriting, loan approval, or financial analysis of a Customer or Potential Customer\u2019s business as a part of a supervisory or management role, so long as such activity does not require the disclosure of Confidential Information, direct contact with the Customer or Potential Customer, or the disclosure of Employee\u2019s role to the Customer or Potential Customer;\nc. performing or supervising those that perform data processing, accounting, rate review, document review or similar \u201cback room\u201d services related to a Customer or Potential Customer so long as the services do not require the disclosure of Confidential Information or contact with the Customer or Potential Customer.\n6. Non-Solicitation of Employees and Others. In consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee\u2019s employment with a Financial Institution, for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee\u2019s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee\u2019s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:\nc. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Employee to terminate his or her employment with a Banking Organization, or offer or provide employment (whether such employment is with Employee or any other Person) either on a full-time or part-time, consulting or Independent Contractor basis; or\nd. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Independent Contractors or Agents to terminate their contract or relationship with a Banking Organization or discontinue providing services to a Banking Organization and/or Customers; or\ne. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any suppliers, vendors or others who were supplying services or goods to a Banking Organization during the one year period prior to Employee\u2019s termination, to terminate, reduce, limit or change their business or relationship with a Banking Organization.\n7. Tolling of Covenants. Employee acknowledges that a Banking Organization is entitled to the full post-termination restrictions on the activities set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as applicable. Therefore, in the event any of the provisions of these Sections are breached by Employee, the commencement of the applicable post-termination restriction will not begin until Employee is in full compliance with Section 5 and/or 6.\n8. Severability/Blue Pencil. Each of the provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenants in Sections 5 and 6, are distinct and severable, notwithstanding that the covenants may be set forth in one section for convenience. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, for any reason, neither the validity of the remaining part of such provision nor the validity of any other provision of this Agreement shall in any way be affected. Should any particular restrictive covenant, provision or clause of this Agreement be held unreasonable or unenforceable for any reason, including without limitation, the time period, geographic area and/or scope of activity covered by such covenant, provision or clause, the parties acknowledge and agree that such covenant, provision or clause shall be given effect and enforce to whatever extent would be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law. The parties expressly authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to modify or revise such provision to limit the covenants to cover the maximum period of time, range of activities or other restrictions as would be enforceable under Indiana law.\n9. Available Relief. Employee agrees that a Banking Organization, or its successor or assigns, will suffer irreparable damage and injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of any breach by Employee of any provision of Sections 4, 5 or 6, herein. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or of a threatened or attempted breach by Employee of Sections 4, 5, or 6, in addition to all other remedies to which a Banking Organization is entitled under law, in equity, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, monetary damages), a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary or permanent injunction (without the necessity of showing any actual damage) or a decree of specific performance and no bond or other security shall be required in that connection.\n10. Enforcement/Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In any action that is brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys\u2019 and paralegal fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. If a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, institute any action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, Employee hereby waives all claims or defenses that a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, have an adequate remedy at law, and Employee shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.\n11. Assignments; Successors and Assigns. The rights and obligations of Employee hereunder are not assignable or delegable by Employee, and any prohibited assignment or delegation will be null and void. The Banking Organization may, without the consent of the Employee, assign this Agreement to any successor or in connection with any merger, consolidation, share exchange, combination, sale of stock or assets or similar transaction. The provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of a Banking Organization.\n12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under, subject to and governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, without consideration of the choice of law principles thereof, and all questions concerning its validity, construction and administration shall be determined in accordance with Indiana law.\n13. Entire Agreement/Modification/Waiver. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and expressly supersedes any prior agreements between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be terminated, amended or modified without the prior written consent of the Bank\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Employee. No failure or delay by a Banking Organization in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement operate or be construed as a continuing waiver or a waiver of any subsequent breach or noncompliance hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by a Banking Organization shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver by a Banking Organization under this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by the Bank\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. A waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived and will not constitute a waiver for the future or act on anything other than that which is specifically waived.\n14. \u201cNo-Defense\u201d Provision. The covenants set forth in this Agreement are essential terms and conditions to a Banking Organization employing or continuing to employ Employee, and shall be construed as independent of any other obligations or agreements between Employee and a Banking Organization. The existence of any claim or cause of action Employee may have against a Banking Organization, including, but not limited to, the alleged material breach by a Banking Organization of any agreement with Employee, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by a Banking Organization of the covenants and obligations in this Agreement and shall not relieve Employee of his or her obligations under this Agreement.\n15. Jurisdiction and Venue. The parties agree that all suits, actions, proceedings, litigation, disputes, or claims relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be filed and tried in the Superior or Circuit Court, as appropriate, of Vigo County, Indiana, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Terre Haute Division. In this regard, the parties hereby: (a) agree that venue shall be such stated courts; (b) irrevocably consent to service of process and to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts; and (c) irrevocably waive any claim of inconvenient forum if any such suit, claim, proceeding, litigation, dispute, or claim has been filed, brought, or made in any of such courts.\n16. Construction. This Agreement is the result of negotiations between the parties, and no party shall be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement; accordingly, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed without any presumption or inference based upon or against the party causing this Agreement to be prepared. The language of this Agreement shall in all cases be construed as a whole, according to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.\n17. Review and Consultation. Employee acknowledges and agrees that he/she has read this Agreement in its entirety prior to executing it, understands the provisions and effects of this Agreement, and has consulted with or had the opportunity to consult with an attorney or other advisers as he/she deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement.\n18. Section Headings. Section headings are inserted into this Agreement for convenience only and shall not affect any construction or interpretation of this Agreement.\n19. Reasonableness.

Employee agrees that the covenants, restrictions and obligations will not affect Employee\u2019s ability to make a living.\n20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of identical counterparts, each of which shall be deemed a duplicate original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. The parties agree that signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic means are acceptable the same as original signatures for the execution of the Agreement.\n21. Miscellaneous. Any change in Employee\u2019s duties, responsibilities, title, position, compensation, or status, with a Financial Institution will not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.\n22. Representations. Employee represents and warrants that he/she is not a party to an agreement with his or her prior employer(s) (other than Heritage or HopFed) or any other Person that prohibits Solicitation of business or competing with that employer or other Person.

"      ""text"": ""MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is dated as of March 31, 2012 between Integrated Device Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cIDT\u201d), and PLX Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cPLX\u201d). IDT and PLX may work together to evaluate a possible strategic transaction involving IDT and PLX (\u201cProposed Transaction\u201d). As used in this Agreement, the party disclosing Confidential Information, as defined below, is the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and the party receiving the Confidential Information is the \u201cRecipient\u201d.\n1. During the evaluation of the Proposed Transaction, the Recipient agrees to treat confidentially information that is furnished by either the Disclosing Party or its Representatives (as defined below) to the Recipient or the Recipient\u2019s subsidiaries or its or their respective directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, representatives, including, without limitation, financial advisors, counsel, accountants, experts, and consultants (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) in connection with the Proposed Transaction, together with notes, analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by the Recipient or by its Representatives to the extent they contain or otherwise reflect such information or the Disclosing Party\u2019s review of, or interest in, the Recipient (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\n2. The Confidential Information will be used solely for the purposes of evaluating the Proposed Transaction, provided, however, that the Recipient may disclose any Confidential Information to its Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction. Prior to disclosing the Confidential Information to any Representative, however, the Recipient shall inform the Representative of the confidential nature of such information and undertake reasonable efforts to cause them to treat such information on a confidential basis. The Recipient shall be responsible for the breach of this Agreement by its Representatives that have not separately signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, and shall take all reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives from unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party and its Representatives shall otherwise have no recourse against any of the Recipient\u2019s Representatives that have not separately signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives.\n3. The public disclosure of the Proposed Transaction could have a material adverse effect on IDT\u2019s and PLX\u2019s businesses if, for any reason, a definitive agreement with respect to such transaction is not consummated. Accordingly, each party agrees that without the prior written consent of the other, it will not, and it will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any person, other than its Representatives, either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Proposed Transaction between IDT and PLX or any of the terms and conditions with respect to the Proposed Transaction and no Confidential Information will be provided to such persons. The term \u201cperson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, governmental agency or body, partnership or individual.\n4. The parties hereby acknowledge that they are aware that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information of the type which is the subject of this Agreement from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person will purchase or sell such securities.\n5. Confidential Information disclosed hereunder shall at all times remain, as between the parties, the property of the Disclosing Party. No license under any trade secrets, copyrights, or other rights is granted by this Agreement or any disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder.\n6. Upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request, the Recipient shall promptly destroy or return to the Disclosing Party all written Confidential Information (whether prepared by the Disclosing party or its Representatives) and will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written materials except that (i) one copy of each electronic version of such materials may be retained by Recipient and its Representatives in their archives pursuant to such party\u2019s standard data backup and disaster recovery plans and (ii) Recipient\u2019s outside legal counsel and accountants may retain one hard copy of such materials in its archives solely for regulatory or corporate records retention policy compliance and for dispute resolution; provided, however, that any Confidential Information contained in such format may not be used for any other purpose and that all obligations contained herein shall, with respect to any Confidential Information so retained, survive any termination of this Agreement. Return and/or destruction of Confidential Information and copies, extracts or other reproductions thereof and documents, memoranda, notes, and other writings to the extent that they contain Confidential Information shall be certified in writing to the Disclosing Party by an authorized officer of the Recipient supervising such destruction upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s written request.\n7. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or limit the Recipient\u2019s use of information (including, but not limited to, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, and methodologies) (i) that was known to Recipient or any of its Representatives before disclosure by the Disclosing Party or its Representatives, (ii) that was or becomes available to the Recipient or any of its Representatives from a source other than the Disclosing Party or its Representatives, provided that such source is not known by the Recipient to be prohibited from disclosing such information by a contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party or its Representatives, (iii) which is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives in breach of this Agreement or (iv) which is independently developed by Recipient or any of its Representatives without reference to the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n8. During the course of each party\u2019s evaluation of the Proposed Transaction, all inquiries and other communications are to be made only to directors, officers, employees and Representatives of the other parties who have been specifically authorized to discuss the Proposed Transaction. A party shall not directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any shareholder, director, officer, employee or Representative of a party without the express written consent of the other party.\n9. In consideration of the Confidential Information being furnished hereby, each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel of the other party, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this Agreement neither it nor any of its affiliates will, either directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, or otherwise contract for the services of (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of other party or any of its affiliates) any person who is now employed or engaged (either as an employee or consultant) or becomes employed or engaged during the term of this Agreement by the other party or its affiliates, other than persons whose employment or engagement shall have been terminated at least six (6) months prior to the date of such solicitation, employment or other contractual arrangements. The prohibition contained in this paragraph does not extend to general solicitations of employment by a party not specifically directed towards the other party\u2019s employees or consultants including but not limited to (i) advertising on the internet or in a newspaper or periodical of general circulation, (ii) an employee of an executive search firm acting on behalf of the hiring company where the hiring company did not instruct or encourage such solicitation, (iii) a general hiring program conducted by the hiring party in the ordinary course of business (such as a job fair or the like), or (iv) a response by the hiring party if the employee approaches the hiring party on an unsolicited basis.\n10. In the event that a Recipient or its Representative, as the case may be, is requested in any judicial or administrative proceeding to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient or its Representative will give the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other protective remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order (or other protective remedy), the Recipient or its Representative is compelled to disclose Confidential Information, the Recipient or its Representative may disclose such information without liability hereunder; provided, however, (i) that the Recipient or its Representative give the Disclosing Party prompt notice of the information to be disclosed and, upon request and at the expense of the Disclosing Party, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information, (ii) only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed will be disclosed and (iii) the Recipient or its Representative may make such disclosure only if it has received the advice of counsel that, under the circumstances then existing, making such disclosure is necessary or advisable under applicable law.\n11. Although each party will endeavor to include in the Confidential Information items known to it which it believes to be relevant for the purpose of the other party\u2019s investigation and analysis of the Proposed Transaction, each party understands and agrees that neither the other party nor any of its Representatives have made or make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. In particular, and without limitation of the foregoing, each party understands that any projected or forecasted financial, operating, performance, strategy or other information reflects merely the judgment of management of such party at the time of the preparation of such information, and is based upon a number of factors and circumstances beyond the control of the party and its management. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that actual results or performance will be in line with any such projections or forecasts. Each party agrees that, except as otherwise specifically agreed to in a definitive written transaction agreement or other binding agreement, neither party nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the other party or any of its affiliates or Representatives arising out of or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information.\n12. Subject to its confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations as set forth in this Agreement, each party\u2019s right to develop, use and market products and services similar to or competitive with those of the other party shall remain unimpaired. Each party acknowledges that the other party may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information.\n13. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by a party or its Representatives and that, in addition to all other available remedies, either party may be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach.\n14. The parties agree that unless and until a definitive written agreement or other binding agreement between the parties with respect to a relationship of the type contemplated by the Proposed Transaction has been executed and delivered by each party hereto, no party will be under any obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a relationship by virtue of this or any written or oral expression concerning such a transaction by any of its Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the other party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make or not to make any proposal and to reject any and all proposals (or requests to make one or more proposals) made by the other party or any of its directors, officers, affiliates, employees, agents, advisors or representatives with regard to the Proposed Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.\n15. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, understandings, promises and assurances relating thereto. This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective advisors, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, owners, affiliates, representatives and agents, and shall be governed by, construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws which would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\n16. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed an original and all of which counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement. Nothing in this Agreement may be modified or waived except by a written agreement between the parties expressly so modifying or waiving this Agreement.\n17.

"      ""text"": ""CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nTOM BROWN, INC.\nNovember 6, 2003\nSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL\nEnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc.\nU.S. Bank Tower\n950 17th Street, Suite 2600\nDenver, CO 80202\nAttention: Roger Biemans, President\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n In connection with the consideration of a possible transaction between Tom Brown, Inc. (\""TBI\"") and EnCana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. (\""EnCana\""), such possible transaction being herein referred to as the \""Transaction,\"" TBI and EnCana acknowledge that TBI may make available to EnCana from time to time certain information concerning the structure of the proposed transaction and/or TBI's business, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities, whether prepared by TBI, its advisors or otherwise. As a condition to entering into any discussions relating to the Transaction, EnCana agrees to comply with its obligations hereunder and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions as hereinafter set forth.\n 1. Evaluation Material; Non-Disclosure Obligation and Use Restriction. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" shall mean all information, data and analysis furnished by TBI or its Representatives to EnCana or its Representatives relating to TBI or the Transaction, and any analyses, compilations, studies, documents or other material prepared by EnCana or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part upon such information, data or analysis, but does not include information, data or analysis that (i) is already in the possession of EnCana or its Representatives or becomes subsequently available to EnCana or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source not known or reasonably suspected by EnCana or its Representatives to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or secrecy obligation to TBI, (ii) is or becomes generally available to or known by the public other than as a result of a breach of this letter agreement by EnCana or its Representatives or (iii) has already been or is hereafter independently acquired or developed by EnCana without violating any confidentiality agreement or secrecy obligation to TBI. \""Representatives\"" shall mean such party's affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, lenders or advisers and representatives of the foregoing. EnCana recognizes and acknowledges the potential competitive value of the Evaluation Material and the damage that could result from the disclosure thereof to third parties. Accordingly, EnCana agrees that the Evaluation Material will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction and related actions, and that such information will be kept confidential by EnCana and its Representatives; provided, however, that (w) such information may be disclosed by EnCana to its Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction or their participation therein (it being understood that such Representatives shall be informed of the confidential nature of the information), (x) it shall not constitute a breach of this letter agreement if any disclosure of such information is made with TBI's prior written consent, (y) it shall not constitute a breach of this letter agreement for EnCana or its Representatives to disclose such information to the extent that EnCana believes, based on the advice of counsel, that it is legally required to disclose such information in order to avoid committing a violation of any law, rule or regulation, including any rules or regulations of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system, provided that EnCana provides prompt notice to TBI of the proposed disclosure and takes the other actions required in connection with a required disclosure pursuant to Section 3 below and (z) it shall not constitute a breach of this letter agreement for EnCana or its Representatives to disclose such information to the extent that such disclosure is permitted pursuant to Section 3 below. EnCana agrees to be responsible for any breach of this letter agreement by any of its Representatives.\n 2. Non-Disclosure of Discussions. Each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, such party and its Representatives will not disclose to any other person (other than such party's Representative's on a need to know basis) the fact that any Evaluation Material has been made available hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to the possible Transaction (including the status thereof); provided, that a party may make such disclosure if (i) based on the advice of such party's counsel, such disclosure is necessary to avoid committing a violation of, or to insure compliance with, any laws, rules or regulations, including any rules or regulations of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system and (ii) the disclosing party provides advance notice to the other party of the proposed disclosure and cooperates in good faith with respect to the timing, manner and content of such disclosure (to the extent consistent with its obligation to make disclosure).\n 3. Required Disclosure. In the event that EnCana or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any other facts or information, the disclosure of which is prohibited by this letter agreement, EnCana shall (i) provide TBI with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that TBI may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this letter agreement and (ii) consult with TBI as to the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy, or the receipt of a waiver by TBI, EnCana or any of its Representatives should nonetheless, based on the advice of such party's counsel, disclose the Evaluation Material and/or the facts or information covered by Section 2, EnCana or its Representative may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material and/or such facts or information that such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed; provided that EnCana gives TBI written notice of the Evaluation Material and/or such facts or other information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is reasonably practicable and exercises its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and/or such facts or other information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with TBI to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Evaluation Material and/or such facts or information.\n 4. Termination of Discussions. If either party decides that it does not wish to proceed with discussions or negotiations relating to a Transaction with the other party and the party so deciding promptly informs the other party of that decision, or at any time upon the request of TBI for any reason, EnCana will promptly deliver to TBI or, at the option of EnCana, destroy all written (and electronic) Evaluation Material. In the event of such a decision or request, all other Evaluation Material prepared by EnCana shall be destroyed, and in no event shall EnCana be obligated to disclose or provide the Evaluation Material prepared by it or its Representatives to TBI provided that a single copy of each item returned or destroyed may be retained in the files of EnCana's outside legal counsel for the purpose of resolving any disputes that may arise under this letter agreement. If requested, the destruction of Evaluation Material shall be certified in writing by an authorized officer of EnCana. Notwithstanding the termination of any discussions or the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by their obligations of confidentiality hereunder for a period of eighteen months from the date hereof.\n 5. Standstill Agreement. For a period of 18 months from the date hereof, EnCana agrees that it and its affiliates shall not, without the prior written request of TBI, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with others, (a) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, by purchase, or otherwise, ownership (including, but not limited to, beneficial ownership as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of more than 1% of any class of voting securities issued by TBI or any material assets of TBI or any securities or material assets of any subsidiary of TBI, (b) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving TBI or any of its subsidiaries, (c) make, or in any way participate in, any \""solicitation\"" of \""proxies\"" (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission) with respect to the securities of TBI, or advise or seek to influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, or giving of consents with respect to, any securities of TBI or any of its subsidiaries, (d) seek or propose to influence or control (whether though a \""group,\"" as such term is used in Rule 13d-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise) the management, board of directors, policies or affairs of TBI or any of its subsidiaries, (e) to the extent doing so would require the public disclosure of such action by TBI, make any request to waive or amend any provision of this Section 5, (f) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with any of the foregoing or (g) encourage any third party to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that this Section 5 shall terminate with respect to EnCana if a person or entity (other than EnCana or an affiliate of EnCana) acquires, enters an agreement to acquire, or publicly proposes to acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger or otherwise, more than 50% of the voting securities of TBI (i.e., those securities of TBI that are entitled to participate in the annual election of directors), or otherwise acquires, enters an agreement to acquire, or publicly proposes to acquire, the ability to control the management or policies of TBI. As used in this Section 5, the term \""securities\"" shall mean any securities of TBI and any direct or indirect warrants, rights or options to acquire securities of TBI.\n 6. Procedure for Communications. It is understood that the parties will arrange for appropriate contacts for due diligence purposes. Unless otherwise agreed, all (i) communications regarding a possible Transaction, (ii) requests for information and\n(iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to the respective party's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel.\n 7. Prohibition on Employee Hiring. Until the first anniversary of the date hereof, EnCana will not, nor will it permit any of its subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees to, directly or indirectly, solicit or hire the services, as employee, consultant or otherwise, of any employee of TBI or its subsidiaries with whom EnCana had contact in connection with its consideration of the Transaction or who became known to EnCana specifically in connection with its consideration of the Transaction, except that this provision shall not prohibit the hiring of any such employee (i) who responds to any public advertising for employment without any other direct or indirect solicitation or (ii) whose employment by TBI or its subsidiary has been terminated prior to the commencement of discussions with such employee.\n 8. Securities Law. EnCana hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and that it has advised or will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters that arc the subject of this agreement, that the United States securities laws may prohibit any person who has material, nonpublic information concerning the matters that are the subject of this agreement from purchasing or selling securities of a company that may be a party to a transaction of the type contemplated by this agreement or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n 9. Miscellaneous. (a) Unless and until a definitive agreement between the parties with respect to any Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither TBI nor EnCana will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this letter or any written or oral expression with respect to such a Transaction by any of its Representatives except for the matters specifically agreed to in this letter agreement. Each party further agrees that neither party shall have\nany obligation to authorize or pursue with the other party any Transaction. Each party acknowledges and agrees that each reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the other at any time.\n (b) It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. The agreements set forth in this letter agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing between the parties hereto.\n (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary other than paragraph 7 above, all of the obligations of the parties hereunder shall (if not sooner terminated) terminate on the second anniversary of the date hereof; provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve a party from liability for any breach by such party of the terms hereof that exists on the date of such termination.\n (d) EnCana understands and agrees that neither TBI nor any of its Representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material or shall have any liability to EnCana or any of its Representatives resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material or any errors in or omissions therefrom, except in each case to the extent expressly provided in any definitive agreement.\n (e) Each party hereby represents that it has the power and authority to execute and deliver this letter agreement, and that it has been duly authorized and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of such party, enforceable in accordance with its terms. This letter agreement shall be binding upon the respective successors in interest of the parties hereto and shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the respective successors in interest of the parties hereto.\n (f) This agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding between the parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements, commitments, representations, writings and discussions, whether oral or written, relating to that subject matter. If any provision of this letter agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of the provisions of this letter shall remain in full force and effect and any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be replaced with a valid, legal or enforceable provision, the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.\n (g) The validity and interpretation of this letter agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Colorado without regard to conflicts-of-law rules or principles.\n (h) This letter agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts. Each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\n (i) EnCana agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this letter agreement by EnCana or any of its Representatives and that TBI shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as well as reimbursement for legal and other expenses as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this letter agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. In the event of litigation concerning this letter agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final nonappealable order that a party has breached this letter agreement, then such party shall be liable for and pay the other party's reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom or review thereof.\n Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning one copy of this letter agreement to the undersigned.\n Very truly yours,\nTOM BROWN, INC.\nBy:\n /s/ JAMES D.

Term. Unless otherwise provided herein, all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate and cease to have any force or effect on the earlier of: (i) two years from the date hereof, or (ii) the date of any consummation of the Potential Transaction.\n3. Non-disclosure of Confidential Information. The Company expressly agrees that it will keep ABRH\u2019s Confidential Information confidential and that neither the Company nor any of its affiliates nor any of its or their directors, officers, employees, operating partners, consultants, or advisors (including without limitation, attorneys and accountants) (collectively, but only to the extent that such persons actually receive Confidential Information, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) will use, for its own benefit (other than in connection with the Potential Transaction), or communicate or disclose (orally, in writing, or in any other manner) to any other person or entity any Confidential Information, or that the Company or any of its Representatives have received or otherwise been provided access to Confidential Information by any other party. The Company further agrees that it and its Representatives will not in any way cause or encourage another person to disclose ABRH\u2019s Confidential Information to any person or entity or judicial or administrative agency or body for any reason whatsoever unless required to do so pursuant to legal process. The Company will only use ABRH\u2019s Confidential Information for the transaction contemplated above and will only disclose ABRH\u2019s Confidential Information to its Representatives who need to know such information and who are informed of the terms of this Agreement and are directed to keep such Confidential Information confidential. The Company will be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by its Representatives. The Company will not, without ABRH\u2019s written consent, disclose or issue any news release, announcement, denial, or confirmation of this Agreement or any actual or potential business negotiation or relationship between the parties. The Company and its Representatives receiving Confidential Information from ABRH will protect ABRH\u2019s Confidential Information from both unauthorized use and disclosure by exercising at least the same degree of care that is used for similar information of its own, but no less than reasonable care.\n(a) Exclusions. The term, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d, does not include, and the Company has no obligation to protect information which is (i) known to or acquired by the Company before disclosure under this Agreement; (ii) independently developed by the Company without relying on ABRH\u2019s Confidential Information; (iii) or becomes part of the public domain (other than as a result of disclosure by the Company or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement) or lawfully obtained from a third party who is not, to the Company\u2019s knowledge, under an obligation of confidentiality to ABRH with respect to such information; (iv) free of confidentiality restrictions by written agreement of ABRH; or (v) required to be disclosed by any law, government regulation, or judicial or other governmental order, provided that, if legally permissible, the Company provides reasonable advance written notice to ABRH to afford ABRH the opportunity to seek a protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If the Company becomes legally obligated or receives a subpoena or other legal demand issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental body to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall cooperate with ABRH in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and shall use reasonable efforts to protect the confidential and proprietary status of any disclosed Confidential Information. ABRH will reimburse the Company and its Representatives for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its compliance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n4. Nature of Relationship. ABRH has no obligation to disclose any Confidential Information that it owns or possesses to the Company or its Representatives under this Agreement. Neither party has any obligation to enter into any transaction with the other. Furthermore, ABRH warrants that it has the right to disclose its own Confidential Information, but does not otherwise make any representation as to their accuracy or completeness. All Confidential Information of ABRH will remain the sole and exclusive property of ABRH. This Agreement grants no rights of ownership, licenses, or any other intellectual property right. Moreover, this Agreement does not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other such relationship.\n5. Return of Materials. Confidential Information may be reproduced by the Company and Company Representatives solely for the purpose of evaluating the Potential Transaction. Upon request of ABRH for any reason, the Company shall promptly return to ABRH, or at Company\u2019s option, destroy (except originals, equipment, and devices delivered by ABRH to the Company, which shall be returned to ABRH), all equipment, documents, devices of any kind, or other material of any kind, in any form, containing any Confidential Information, together with all copies, summaries, abstracts, excerpts, extracts, replicas, reproductions, and samples of any of the foregoing, and certify the destruction of any copy or partial copy made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may retain such copies of the Confidential Information that reside on the Company\u2019s back-up storage or archiving system, solely for document retention purposes and not for any other use, and for compliance purposes as required by law or to evidence compliance of Company\u2019s obligations under this Agreement.\n6. Disclosure and Solicitation of Employees. The Company and its Representatives will make no contact, written or verbal, with any of ABRH\u2019s management, staff, or employees not directly involved with the transaction contemplated above for purposes of evaluating the Potential Transaction unless with ABRH\u2019s written permission. Further, during the term of eighteen (18) months beginning on the date hereof, the Company shall not knowingly solicit or recruit management or executive level employees of ABRH who became known to the Company through work on the above transaction or purpose contemplated above, without the prior written consent of ABRH. Regardless of the above, this provision shall not restrict the right of the Company to solicit or recruit such employees as a result of any substantial asset purchase or sale or merger or through the general use of the media, and the Company shall not be prohibited from hiring such employees who answer any general advertisement or otherwise voluntarily apply for hire without having been personally solicited or recruited by the Company.\n7. Irreparable Injury; Injunctive Relief. The Company acknowledges that any unauthorized or wrongful disclosure or use of Confidential Information by the Company, including the Company\u2019s Representatives, or any other breach by the Company, may result in irreparable injury to ABRH that is not adequately compensable in monetary damages. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, ABRH shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond and in addition to any other remedy available at law or in equity.

"      ""text"": ""NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (\""Agreement\"") is effective as of the 31st day of July, 2003, by and between Solomon Technologies, Inc. (\""STI\"") and Pinetree (Barbados) Inc. (\""Pinetree\"").\nEXPLANATION\nPinetree filed a lawsuit against STI on December 20, 2002 in United States District Court for the Southern District of Maryland (later moved to the United States District Court for Northern District of Maryland), captioned as Civil Case No. 8:02-cv-04141 (the \""Lawsuit\""), in which Pinetree sought, among other things, payment of the outstanding balance under two Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes issued by STI to Pinetree, dated January 19, 2001 and June 18, 2001, respectively. Since the date of the Lawsuit, the parties have been engaged in settlement discussions. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, STI may wish to provide certain proprietary information to Pinetree in furtherance of those settlement discussions. STI may also provide information to Pinetree in accordance with the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding and other settlement documents between the parties dated as of, or about, the date of this Agreement (collectively, the \""SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS\"")\nAGREEMENT\nIn consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which is mutually acknowledged, the parties agree under seal as follows:\n1. DEFINITION OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. As used in this Agreement, the term \""Proprietary Information\"" means any confidential, non-public or proprietary information, technology or documentation, including without limitation, drawings, designs, business plans and proposals, ideas and prototypes that may be disclosed by STI to Pinetree, whether such is of a technical, commercial, organizational, scientific, financial or business nature.\n2. TERM OF DUTY NOT TO DISCLOSE. Unless a particular portion of Proprietary Information becomes nonproprietary as provided in Section 4(a) hereof, or unless otherwise authorized in a written agreement signed by an authorized officer of STI, Pinetree has a duty to protect each particular portion of Proprietary Information in for a period of five (5) years from the date of this Agreement, provided that Proprietary Information which constitutes a trade secret under applicable law shall be protected as long as the Proprietary Information qualifies as a trade secret under Maryland law.\n3. USE RESTRICTIONS.\na. SOLE PURPOSE. Pinetree may use the Proprietary Information solely for the purpose of evaluating the settlement discussions, or to evaluate such information in connection with STI's performance under any settlement documents which the parties may execute. Unless otherwise expressly authorized to the contrary by STI in a prior signed writing, Pinetree shall not, either directly or indirectly: (a) use, apply, reveal, report, publish or otherwise disclose any of the Proprietary Information to, or for the benefit of, Pinetree or any third party; (b) use or incorporate any of the Proprietary Information in any products or services; or (c) assist, act as an agent for, or act as an advisor or consultant to, any person or entity for the purpose of developing, marketing or selling any product or service that incorporates any of the Proprietary Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Pinetree may use the names of investors provided by STI under the terms of the Settlement Documents solely for the purpose of making an internal decision about whether to convert the Convert Indebtedness then outstanding under the terms of the Convertible Promissory Note between the parties dated as of, or about, the date of this Agreement, and agrees not to contact those investors.\nb. DEGREE OF CARE. Pinetree must protect the Proprietary Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by exercising the same degree of care that Pinetree uses with respect to information of its own of a similar, highly valuable nature, and Pinetree must, at minimum, use at least reasonable care.\nc. DUPLICATION. Pinetree shall not copy, duplicate, replicate, decompile or reverse engineer in any manner whatsoever (whether physically, electronically, in writing or otherwise), in whole or in part, any part of the Proprietary Information without the prior written consent of STI, which consent shall be in STI's sole and absolute discretion, and will immediately notify STI in writing of any unauthorized disclosure of the Proprietary Information. At any time upon STI's request, Pinetree shall promptly redeliver to STI, or destroy at STI's direction, all written material in any media or format whatsoever containing, reflecting or in any way derived from the Proprietary Information (including notes, summaries, copies, extracts or other reproductions, in whole or in part), regardless of whether the material was prepared by STI or on STI's behalf. The redelivery or destruction of the Proprietary Information shall be certified by Pinetree in writing to STI, and shall not in any way relieve Pinetree of its obligation of confidentiality.\n4. EXCEPTIONS.\na. GENERAL EXCEPTIONS. The disclosure and use restrictions imposed in this Agreement do not apply to Proprietary Material that: (a)\nPinetree can show by documentary evidence was already in Pinetree's possession before the disclosure hereunder to Pinetree; (b) is hereafter disclosed to Pinetree by a third party who has no duty of confidentiality to STI in respect of it; or (c) is or becomes generally available to the public through no act or default on Pinetree's part. Proprietary Material that comprises a combination of features shall not be within any of the exceptions set forth above merely because individual features are known or received by Pinetree or are in or fall into the public domain, but only if the combination is know or received by Pinetree or is in or falls into the public domain.\nb. DISCLOSURE UPON REQUEST OF GOVERNMENT. In the event that Pinetree receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Proprietary Information under the terms of a subpoena or other order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by another governmental agency, Pinetree shall: (a) promptly notify STI of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request; (b) consult with STI on the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow such request; (c) if disclosure of such Proprietary Information is required, furnish only such portion of the Proprietary Information as Pinetree is advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed; and (d) cooperate with STI, at STI's expense, in its efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Proprietary Information that is required to be disclosed.\nc. OWNERSHIP; WARRANTIES. Pinetree agrees that all Proprietary Material disclosed shall remain the property of STI, and nothing herein shall be construed as the grant of a license or any other right, either directly or indirectly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, to any Proprietary Material. STI has no obligation to disclose any Proprietary Information. STI makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Material, and shall have no liability to Pinetree or its Representatives resulting from Pinetree's use of the Proprietary Material, except as may be expressly set forth in any subsequent, definitive written agreement between the parties. This Agreement does not create an agency, partnership, joint venture or other like relationship.\n5. FURTHER ASSURANCES; WAIVER. Pinetree agrees to do such further acts and to execute and deliver such additional agreements and instruments from time to time as STI may at any time reasonably request in order to assure and confirm unto STI its rights, powers and remedies conferred in the Agreement. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.\n6. LAW; FORUM. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, without regarding to its choice of law provisions. The parties further agree and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Maryland; thus, in the event that either party initiates an action pursuant to or otherwise governed by this Agreement, the exclusive jurisdiction of such action shall be in Maryland. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may enforce any judgment rendered by such court in any court of competent jurisdiction. STI may take any necessary action to compel specific performance of this Agreement or to enjoin any violation of this Agreement so that Proprietary Material is not used in any manner to harm or adversely affect STI.\n7. CONSTRUCTION. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be legally invalid or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected, and such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision consistent with applicable law and, in its modified form, such provision shall then be enforceable and enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.\n8. ASSIGNMENT. No rights or duties of Pinetree under this Agreement may be assigned without the prior written consent of STI. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Agreement shall be deemed null and void AB INITIO. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their respective Representatives, successors and assigns.\n9. INTEGRATION. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all other agreements, negotiations and proposals, written and oral, between the parties concerning the above-described Proprietary Information. This Agreement may only be modified by a written document signed by authorized officers of both parties. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, by manual or facsimile signature, each of which shall be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.\nSOLOMON TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

As a result of such discussions, the Receiving Party may have access to certain confidential information of the Disclosing Party and GreenWay Consulting, LLC (\""GreenWay\""). The Disclosing Party has entered into a nondisclosure agreement with GreenWay prohibiting disclosure of GreenWay confidential information, subject to the Receiving Party executing this Non-Disclosure Agreement. The Parties desire to enter into this Agreement in order to allow disclosure to the Receiving Party and prohibit disclosure of such information to any other party. Therefore, in consideration of the Receiving Party being given access to certain confidential information of the Disclosing Party and in exchange for the mutual covenant and promises contained herein, with the intent to be legally bound, the Parties agree as follows:\nAGREEMENT\n1. Confidential Information.\n(a) As used in this Agreement, the \""Confidential Information\"" of the Disclosing Party shall mean all information concerning or related to the business, operations, financial condition or prospects of the Disclosing Party or any of their respective Affiliates, regardless of the form in which such information appears and whether or not such information has been reduced to a tangible form, and shall specifically include (1) all information regarding the officers, directors, employees, equity holders, customers, suppliers, distributors, insurers, reinsurers, brokers, independent contractors, sales representatives and licensees of the Disclosing Party and their respective Affiliates, in each case whether present or prospective, (2) all inventions, discoveries, trade secrets, processes, techniques, methods, formulae, ideas and know-how of the Disclosing Party and their respective Affiliates, (3) all financial statements, audit reports, budgets and business plans or forecasts of the Disclosing Party and their respective Affiliates and (4) all information concerning or related to the Transaction; provided, that the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party shall not include (x) information which is or becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party and (y) information which has been or hereafter is lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party (or any of their respective Affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, equity holders or agents) so long as, in the case of information obtained from a third party, such third party was or is not, directly or indirectly, subject to an obligation of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party or any of their Affiliates at the time such Confidential Information was or is disclosed to the Receiving Party. As used in this Paragraph, an \""Affiliate\"" of a Disclosing Party shall mean an entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control of a Disclosing Party, and the term \""control\"" shall mean, with respect to any entity, the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.\n2. Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. Except as otherwise permitted by Section 3, the Receiving Party agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, disclose or use for its own benefit, or that of any third party, any Confidential Information.\n3. Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding Section 2, Receiving Party shall be permitted to:\n(a) disclose Confidential Information to its officers, employees and counsel, but only to the extent reasonably necessary in order for such party to prepare, conduct and execute and deliver definitive documents for the Transaction; provided that Receiving Party shall take all such action as shall be necessary or desirable in order to ensure that each of such persons maintains the confidentiality of any Confidential Information that is so disclosed; and\n(b) disclose Confidential Information to the extent, but only to the extent, required by law; provided, that prior to making any disclosure pursuant to this subsection, the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party of the same, and the Disclosing Party shall have the right to participate with the Receiving Party in determining the amount and type of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, if any, which must be disclosed in order to comply with applicable law, including, without limitation, state and federal securities laws and regulations.\n4. Return of Confidential Information. If activity in respect of the Transaction shall cease without the Transaction being consummated, then, promptly after the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall return to the Disclosing Party all Confidential Information which is in tangible form and which is then in its possession (or in the possession of any of its officers, directors or employees).\n5. Term. This Agreement shall continue indefinitely.\n6. Equitable Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Disclosing Party and GreenWay would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by the Receiving Party in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, it is agreed that the Disclosing Party or GreenWay shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Receiving Party and shall have the right to specifically enforce this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof against the Receiving Party in addition to any other remedy to which the Disclosing Party or GreenWay may be entitled in law or equity.\n7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be a contract under the State of Minnesota and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Minnesota, excluding any choice of law provisions.\n8. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n9. No Assignment or Delegation. Any assignment, delegation or attempted assignment or delegation of the rights or responsibilities established under this Agreement shall be null and void without the prior written duly executed consent by the party charged.\n10. Severability of Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid in a court of law, the remaining provisions shall be construed as if the invalid provision were not included in this Agreement.\n11. Amendment of Agreement. This Agreement may only be amended or modified through a written duly executed instrument by the Parties hereto. Any attempted oral amendment or modification is ineffective and therefore null and void.\n12. No Implied Waiver of Provisions. Either Parties' failure to insist in any one or more instances upon strict performance by the other party of any of the terms of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any continuing or subsequent failure to perform or a delay in performance of any term hereof.\n13. Notices. Any notice required by this Agreement or given in connection with this Agreement, shall be in writing, hand delivered or sent via registered or certified mail, and shall be given to the appropriate party:\nIf to Disclosing Party: Oregon Trail Ethanol Coalition, L.L.C.\n102 West 6th Street\nBox 267\nDavenport, Nebraska 68335\nAttn: Mark L.

As a condition to such information being furnished to each party and its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, \""Representatives\""), each party agrees to treat any such nonpublic information concerning the other party (whether prepared by the disclosing party, its advisors or otherwise and irrespective of the form of communication) which is furnished hereunder to a party or to its Representatives by or on behalf of the disclosing party (herein collectively referred to as the \""Evaluation Material\"") in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions hereinafter set forth.\n1. EVALUATION MATERIAL. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" also shall be deemed to include all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by each party or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished to such party or its Representatives pursuant hereto which is not available to the general public. The term \""Evaluation Material\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party or its Representatives; (ii) was within the receiving party's possession prior to its being furnished to the receiving party by or on behalf of the disclosing party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information; (iii) is or becomes available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the disclosing party, or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the disclosing party or any other party with respect to such information; (iv) is independently developed by the recipient without use of Evaluation Material; or (v) is disclosed by the recipient or its Representatives with the disclosing party's prior written consent.\n2. USE OF EVALUATION MATERIAL. Each party hereby agrees that it and its Representatives shall use the other party's Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and consummating a possible transaction between the parties, and that the disclosing party's Evaluation Material will be kept confidential and each party and its Representatives will not disclose or use for purposes other than the evaluation, negotiation and consummation of a transaction any of the other party's Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) the receiving party may make any disclosure of such information to which the disclosing party gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of such information may be disclosed to the receiving party's Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of assisting the receiving party in evaluating, negotiating and consummating a possible transaction between the parties (it being understood that such Representatives shall be informed by the receiving party of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by the receiving party to treat such information confidentially). In any event, the receiving party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives and the receiving party agrees, at its sole expense, to take all reasonable measures (including but not limited to court proceedings) to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Evaluation Material.\n3. NON-DISCLOSURE. In addition, each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, it and its Representatives will not disclose to any other person the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto, including the status thereof; provided, however, that a party may make such disclosure if, in the written opinion of such party's outside legal counsel, such disclosure is necessary in order to comply with, or avoid committing a violation of, any law or any rule of any applicable stock exchange or system.\n4. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. In the event that a party or any of its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the other party's Evaluation Material, the party requested or required to make the disclosure shall provide the other party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.

TERMINATION OF DISCUSSIONS.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the preceding restrictions contained in this paragraph 8 shall cease to be applicable if a third party shall formally commence any public tender or exchange offer for the outstanding common stock of the Company or if the Company shall publicly announce any proposed merger or other business combination involving the Company pursuant to which the outstanding common stock of the Company would cease to be listed on a national stock exchange.\n9. DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. Each party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any transaction involving the parties shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered.

Definitions.\n1.1 \""Confidential Information\"" means any and all information disclosed by Owner that is identified as \""confidential\"" or \""proprietary,\"" either by legend on written or electronically stored material, or in advance if disclosed verbally. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, research and development, know-how, inventions, trade secrets, software, and market analysis, research, strategies, projections and forecasts. Confidential Information also includes, without limitation, information disclosed by Owner with permission from a third party, and combinations of or with publicly known information where the nature of the combination is not publicly known.\n1.1.1 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include information which:\n(a) was publicly known at the time of Owner's communication thereof to Recipient, or which subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of Recipient;\n(b) was in the possession of Recipient prior to its being communicated to Recipient by Owner;\n(c) becomes available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Owner, provided that such source is not bound by any obligation of confidentiality to Owner with respect to such information; or (d) was independently developed by Recipient without reference to the Confidential Information communicated by Owner.\nSection 2. Covenant Not to Disclose.\nRecipient shall not use Owner's Confidential Information except for purposes of evaluating, maintaining and furthering a business relationship with Owner. Recipient shall maintain in confidence the Confidential Information received from Owner and shall not directly or indirectly disclose such information to any person or entity except Recipient's employees and consultants, and then only on a need-to-know basis. Recipient shall ensure that such employees and consultants are bound by a written agreement to protect the received Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure. Recipient shall protect Owner's Confidential Information from disclosure to others using the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own most highly confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care. Recipient shall not make or distribute any more copies or summaries of Owner's Confidential Information than are necessary to evaluate, maintain and further a business relationship between the Parties, and shall ensure that all such copies or summaries are marked as confidential and the property of Owner.\nSection 3.

Either Party may, at any time, cease providing its Confidential Information to the other Party, and may require the return of Confidential Information previously disclosed by written notice.\nSection 4.

Title.\nOwner shall retain all ownership rights in and to the Confidential Information it discloses to Recipient. No licenses or rights under any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right shall be granted or implied under this Agreement.

Upon termination of this Agreement, Recipient shall promptly return all of Owner's Confidential Information provided to it in tangible form, together with any and all copies and/or summaries, and shall destroy all of Owner's Confidential Information that is electronically stored; provided, however, that each Party's legal department may retain one copy of the Confidential Information in its file solely for the purpose of identifying information designated as \""Confidential Information.\""\nSection 7. Specific Performance.\nThe Parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is unique and valuable, and that Owner will have no adequate remedy at law if Recipient does not comply with its obligations under this Agreement. Therefore, Owner shall have the right, in addition to any other rights it may have, to obtain in any court of competent jurisdiction temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to restrain any breach, threatened breach, or otherwise to specifically enforce any obligations of Recipient if Recipient fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement.\nSection 8. Miscellaneous.\n8.1. Dispute Resolution.\n8.1.1 Governing Law.

My ownership of not more than one(1%) percent of the shares of any class of stock of any corporation which is actively traded on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ shall not be deemed, in and of itself, to violate the prohibitions of this paragraph.

NON-SOLICITATION. During my employment with the Company and for a period two (2) years thereafter, I will not encourage any employee of the Company to terminate their employment with the Company, nor solicit nor hire any employee of the Company for employment by any corporation or any other commercial enterprise other than the Company, unless first approached in writing by the Company employee.

NO EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATION. Other than the provisions of Section 9 hereof, I understand that this Agreement does not create an obligation on the part of the Company to continue my employment with the Company.

If I am terminated for any reason, in consideration for the Non-competition covenant and the other covenants and agreements set forth in the Agreement, I will receive a salary of $275,000 per annum for one year after such termination payable in bi-weekly installments in accordance with the Company's payroll procedures.\n10. REMEDIES UPON BREACH.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of excessive scope as to geographic, temporal or functional coverage, such provision will be deemed to extend only over the maximum geographic, temporal and functional scope as to which it may be enforceable.\n13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and myself with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior representations and agreements with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or waived except by a written instrument duly executed by the person against whom enforcement of such amendment, modification or waiver is sought. The failure of any party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement or the waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement in any particular case will not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or to be deemed a waiver of any separate or subsequent breach.\n14.
