II. Information related to the security of existing or proposed information technology systems or industrial control technology systems of a utility owned or operated by a unit of local government, which, if disclosed, would facilitate unauthorized access to, and alteration or destruction of, such systems in a manner that would adversely impact the safe and reliable operation of the systems and the utility.
III. Results of periodic internal audits and evaluations of the security program for an agency's data and information technology resources are confidential and exempt.

3. Additional Disclosures. Receiver may disclose Confidential Information if the same:
(a) was generally available at the time it was disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure made by Receiver;
(b) was known to the Receiver at the time it received such information, as evidenced by contemporaneous documentation in Receiver’s files;

B. The data and information that State expects to provide to Recipient for use in evaluating Recipient's proposal to provide the Services is confidential and not public data and the parties desire to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement to set forth their respective duties and obligations regarding State's data and information.
Provisions
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Background Information, which is incorporated by this reference as if fully re-written herein and the mutual covenants and provisions set forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Section 1. Confidential Information. As used in this Agreement, ""Confidential Information"" shall mean any and all technical and non-technical information about State, including, but not limited to data and information processed by State in connection with evaluating the Services. The term shall also include all ""protected health information"" (as defined by 45 C.F.R. § 160.103) and any other personally identifiable information (""PII"") regarding any individual who is, or may become, eligible for the State's Plan (including, but not limited to, such Plan's travel benefit). The Recipient hereby agrees to abide by State's determination that such information is Confidential Information and that the same is of a special and unique nature and value, important and material, that it gravely affects the effective and successful conduct of the business and that it may include personal identification information or other information of State or State employees and their dependents that is to be maintained as confidential.
Section 2. Preservation of Confidentiality. All Confidential Information (a) supplied by any employee, agent, consultant, or independent contractor of State (""State Representatives"") to the Recipient or any employee, agent, officer, director, shareholder, independent contractor or representative of the Recipient (collectively, the ""Recipient Representatives""), (b) obtained by the Recipient or any Recipient Representatives from any documents, meetings or telephone conversations with any State Representatives or from books or records of State, (c) obtained by the Recipient or any Recipient Representatives or in any other manner including through hosting the software evaluation on Recipient's website, or (d) jointly or individually developed by State and/or Recipient shall be protected and maintained by the Recipient on a confidential basis and the Recipient shall not use any of the Confidential Information for any purposes (other than as permitted by this Agreement). The Recipient shall refrain from directly or indirectly disclosing any of the Confidential Information to any person, firm, fund, or entity, or knowingly making any Confidential Information available to any others for any use (other than as permitted by this Agreement).

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the Recipient shall:
(a) Restrict disclosure of the Confidential Information only to those of the persons as may be absolutely necessary;
(b) Advise all persons to whom Confidential Information is disclosed of the strict obligations of confidentiality hereunder; and
(c) Take such steps to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as may be taken to protect the Recipient's own confidential materials, but in no event shall the Recipient use less than a reasonable degree of care.

WHEREAS, in order for the Contractor to perform the work required under the Contract, it will be necessary for the State at times to provide the Contractor and the Contractor’s employees, agents, and subcontractors (collectively the “Contractor’s Personnel”) with access to certain information the State deems confidential information (the “Confidential Information”).
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of being given access to the Confidential Information in connection with the solicitation and the Contract, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which the parties acknowledge, the parties do hereby agree as follows:
1. Regardless of the form, format, or media on or in which the Confidential Information is provided and regardless of whether any such Confidential Information is marked as such, “Confidential Information” means (1) any and all information provided by or made available by the State to the Contractor in connection with the Contract and (2) any and all personally identifiable information (PII) (including but not limited to personal information as defined in Md. Ann. Code, General Provisions §4-101(h) and Md. Ann. Code, State Govt. § 10-1301(c)) and protected health information (PHI) as defined in 45 CFR 160.103 that is provided by a person or entity to the Contractor in connection with this Contract. Confidential Information includes, by way of example only, information that the Contractor views, takes notes from, copies (if the State agrees in writing to permit copying), possesses or is otherwise provided access to and use of by the State in relation to the Contract.
2. The Contractor shall not, without the State’s prior written consent, copy, disclose, publish, release, transfer, disseminate, use, or allow access for any purpose or in any form, any Confidential Information except for the sole and exclusive purpose of performing under the Contract. The Contractor shall limit access to the Confidential Information to the Contractor’s Personnel who have a demonstrable need to know such Confidential Information in order to perform under the Contract and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. Contractor shall provide copies of such agreements to the State. The names of such personnel are attached hereto and made a part hereof as Attachment I-2. Contractor shall update Attachment I-2 by adding additional names (whether Contractor’s Personnel or a subcontractor’s personnel) as needed, from time to time.
3. If the Contractor intends to disseminate any portion of the Confidential Information to non-employee agents who are assisting in the Contractor’s performance of the Contract or will otherwise have a role in performing any aspect of the Contract, the Contractor shall first obtain the written consent of the State to any such dissemination. The State may grant, deny, or condition any such consent, as it may deem appropriate in its sole and absolute subjective discretion.
4. The Contractor hereby agrees to hold the Confidential Information in trust and in strictest confidence, adopt or establish operating procedures and physical security measures, and take all other measures necessary to protect the Confidential Information from inadvertent release or disclosure to unauthorized third parties and to prevent all or any portion of the Confidential Information from falling into the public domain or into the possession of persons not bound to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.
5. The Contractor shall promptly advise the State in writing if it learns of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of the Confidential Information by any of the Contractor’s Personnel or the Contractor’s former Personnel. Contractor shall, at its own expense, cooperate with the State in seeking injunctive or other equitable relief against any such person(s).
6. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, return to the State all Confidential Information in its care, custody, control or possession upon request of the State or on termination of the Contract.
7. A breach of this Agreement by the Contractor or the Contractor’s Personnel shall constitute a breach of the Contract between the Contractor and the State.
8. Contractor acknowledges that any failure by the Contractor or the Contractor’s Personnel to abide by the terms and conditions of use of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the State and that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate the State for such breach. Accordingly, the Contractor agrees that the State may obtain an injunction to prevent the disclosure, copying or improper use of the Confidential Information. The Contractor consents to personal jurisdiction in the Maryland State Courts. The State’s rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and the State expressly reserves any and all rights, remedies, claims and actions that it may have now or in the future to protect the Confidential Information and seek damages from the Contractor and the Contractor’s Personnel for a failure to comply with the requirements of this Agreement. In the event the State suffers any losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, or costs (including, by way of example only, attorneys’ fees and disbursements) that are attributable, in whole or in part to any failure by the Contractor or any of the Contractor’s Personnel to comply with the requirements of this Agreement, the Contractor shall hold harmless and indemnify the State from and against any such losses, damages, liabilities, expenses, and costs.
9. The parties further agree that:
a. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland;
b. The rights and obligations of the Contractor under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the State;
c. The State makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information;
d. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement;
e. Signatures exchanged by facsimile are effective for all purposes hereunder to the same extent as original signatures;
f. The Recitals are not merely prefatory but are an integral part hereof; and
g. The effective date of this Agreement shall be the same as the effective date of the Agreement entered into by the parties.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have, by their duly authorized representatives, executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

1. The purpose of this agreement.
This agreement allows us to disclose confidential information to each other, to our own affiliates and to the other's affiliates, under the following terms. An ""affiliate"" is any legal entity that one of us owns, that owns one of us or that is under common control with one of us. ""Control"" and ""own"" mean possessing a 50% or greater Interest in an entity or the right to direct the management of the entity.
2. Confidential information.
a. What is included, ""Confidential information"" is non-public information, know-how and trade secrets in any form that:
 Are designated as ""confidential""; or
 A reasonable person knows or reasonably should understand to be confidential.
b. What is not included? The following types of information, however marked, are not confidential information. Information that:
 Is, or becomes, publicly available without a breach of this agreement;
 Was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential;
 Is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential;
 Is independently developed; or
 Is a comment or suggestion one of us volunteers about the other's business, products or services.
3. Treatment of confidential information.
a. In general. Subject to the other terms of this agreement, each of us agrees:
 We will not disclose the other's confidential information to third parties; and
 We will use and disclose the other's confidential information only for purposes of our business relationship with each other.
b. Security precautions. Each of us agrees:
 To take reasonable steps to protect the other's confidential information. These steps must be at least as protective as those we take to protect our own confidential information;
 To notify the other promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information; and
 To cooperate with the other to help regain control of the confidential information and prevent further unauthorized use or disclosure of it.
c. Sharing confidential information with affiliates and representatives.
 A ""representative"" is an employee, contractor, advisor or consultant of one of us or one of our respective affiliates.
 Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information to our representatives (who may then disclose that confidential information to other of our representatives) only if those representatives have a need to know about it for purposes of our business relationship with each other. Before doing so, each of us must:
o Ensure that affiliates and representatives are required to protect the confidential information on terms consistent with this agreement; and
o Accept responsibility for each representative's use of confidential information.
 Neither of us is required to restrict work assignments of representatives who have had access to confidential information. Neither of us can control the incoming information the other will disclose to us in the course of working together, or what our representatives will remember, even without notes or other aids. We agree that use of information in representatives' unaided memories in the development or deployment of our respective products or services does not create liability under this agreement or trade secret law, and we agree to limit what we disclose to the other accordingly.
d. Disclosing confidential information if required to by law. Each of us may disclose the other's confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, each of us must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give the other enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.
4. Length of confidential information obligations
a. Termination. This agreement continues in effect until one of us terminates it. Either of us may terminate this agreement for any reason by providing the other with 60 days' advance written notice. Termination of this agreement will not change any of the rights and duties made while this agreement is in effect.
b. No other use or disclosure of confidential information. Except as permitted above, neither of us will use nor disclose the other's confidential information for three years after we receive it. The three-year
c. time period does not apply if applicable law requires a longer period.
5. General rights, obligations and miscellaneous.
a. Law that applies; jurisdiction and venue. The laws of the State of Florida govern this agreement. If federal jurisdiction exists, we each consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts in Broward County, Florida. If not, we each consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of Broward County, Florida.
b. Non-solicitation- Clients. Each party expressly agrees to non-solicitation of business services with each other’s existing customers. As part of subsequent agreements between Partner and BCG to engage in joint customer business, Partner agrees not to solicit business services from any of BCG’s customers where BCG has engaged Partner on any such customer work orders and where BCG has introduced Partner to such customer(s). Conversely, BCG agrees not to solicit business services from any of Partner’s customers where Partner has engaged BCG on any such customer work orders and where Partner has introduced BCG to such customer(s).
c. Non-solicitation- Employees. During the term of the agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, each party agrees not to solicit or recruit any employee of each other without the prior written consent of that party. Both BCG and Partner hereby agree that it will not solicit for hire, in any capacity whatsoever, any of each other’s employees, contractors or other such affiliated resources without prior written consent from the other party.
d. Compliance with law. Parties will comply with all laws regarding confidential information.
e. Waiver. Any delay or failure of either of us to exercise a right or remedy will not result in a waiver of that, or any other, right or remedy.
f. Money damages insufficient. Each of us acknowledges that money damages may not be sufficient compensation for a breach of this agreement. Each of us agrees that the other may seek court orders to stop confidential information from becoming public in breach of this agreement.
g. Attorneys' fees. In any dispute relating to this agreement the prevailing party will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
h. Transfers of this agreement. If one of us transfers this agreement, we will not disclose the other's confidential information to the transferee without the other's consent.
i. Enforceability. If any provision of this agreement is unenforceable, the parties (or, if we cannot agree, a court) will revise it so that it can be enforced. Even if no revision is possible, the rest of this agreement will remain in place.
j. Entire agreement. This agreement does not grant any implied intellectual property licenses to confidential information, except as stated above. We may have contracts with each other covering other specific aspects of our relationship (""other contracts""). The other contract may include commitments about confidential information, either within it or by referencing another non-disclosure agreement. If so, those obligations remain in place for purposes of that other contract. With this exception, this is the entire agreement between us regarding confidential information. It replaces all other agreements and understandings regarding confidential information. We can only change this agreement with a signed document that states that it is changing this agreement."

It is recorded that the disclosing party may well have had business dealings with the receiving party’s customers and no right of exclusivity shall be afforded to the receiving party in this regard. For example, in larger corporate entities, it may well be that the receiving party and disclosing party are dealing with separate departments or individuals or may well have done so previously. The receiving party accepts this fact and whilst the disclosing party shall not intentionally interfere with the receiving party’s marketing strategy, this may at times be inevitable.
5. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

11. GENERAL
11.1 Any failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege in relation to any confidential information and/or pursuant to this agreement will not constitute a waiver of that right, power or privilege, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise of that right, power or privilege.

AND WHEREAS, it is agreed that in order to enable the Bidder to assess the Target, Transnet will disclose Confidential Information relevant to the Proposed Transaction to the Bidder;
AND WHEREAS, the Bidder recognises that careful protection and non-disclosure by the Bidder of Confidential Information disclosed by Transnet is of vital importance to the prosperity of the Target, Transnet and clientele of Transnet;
NOW THEREFORE, Transnet agrees to disclose the Confidential Information and the Bidder agrees to receive the Confidential Information under the following terms and conditions.
1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
1.1 Definition. When used herein, Confidential Information shall mean any information and data (in electronic form, in hard copy or given verbally) of a confidential or proprietary nature which is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, including but not limited to, group corporate strategy and initiatives, customer information, Target information, proprietary technical, financial, personnel and/or commercial information with respect to the Proposed Transaction, Transnet or the Target and any information which is disclosed pursuant to this Agreement and marked “Confidential” by the Disclosing Party. Confidential information specifically excludes the following:
1.1.1 information which is in the public domain or enters the public domain other than by reason of a breach of the terms of this Agreement;
1.1.2 where it becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or the individual members of the Disclosing Party, as the case may be;
1.1.3 where it was known to the Receiving Party prior to having access to the Confidential information; and
1.1.4 where the Receiving Party is obliged to disclose by law, or by order or under the rules of any competent regulatory authority or court.
1.2 Purpose. The purpose of the disclosure of Confidential Information is to enable the Target’s assets and liabilities relevant to the Proposed Transaction to be assessed.
1.3 Ownership. The Confidential Information is and shall be considered valuable trade secrets owned exclusively by the Disclosing Party.

1.6 Authorised. The Disclosing Party is authorised to provide Confidential Information to the Receiving Party.
2. NON-DISCLOSURE
2.1 Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may use the Confidential Information solely for the purposes of assessing the Target for purposes of the Proposed Transaction. The Receiving Party recognises that this Agreement imposes an affirmative duty to hold such information in confidence and protect it from dissemination to and use by any unauthorised persons. In the absence of the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, the Receiving Party shall not produce nor disclose the Confidential Information, or any part thereof, to any third party.
2.2 Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Confidential Information is proprietary information and for the exclusive and non-transferable use of the persons to whom it is addressed and the recipients of the Confidential Information agree that all of the information contained herein is of a confidential nature and is subject to this Confidentiality Agreement, and that they will not, directly, or indirectly, disclose or permit their agents or affiliates to disclose any such information without the prior written consent of Transnet except as expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
2.3 Return of Confidential Information. Promptly following the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will deliver to the Disclosing Party all confidential information (and copies and extracts thereof) furnished to, or created by or on behalf of, the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the return of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
2.4 Remedies. The Receiving Party recognises and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a special, unique and extraordinary character to the Disclosing Party and the Target and the disclosure, misappropriation or unauthorised use of such Confidential Information by the Receiving Party cannot be fully compensated and that, further, any such disclosure, misappropriation or unauthorised use of the Confidential Information shall cause irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party and/or the Target. The Receiving Party expressly agrees, therefore, that the Disclosing Party, in addition to any rights and remedies it may have under this Agreement or at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent the breach, or the further breach, of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees to reimburse the Disclosing Party for any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, opportunity costs, and direct or indirect expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees, profit opportunity returns foregone and any court costs) incurred by the Disclosing Party as a result of any prima facie breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.

3.2 Binding Successors. This agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and assigns.
3.3 Waiver. The waiver or failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided for in this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any further right under this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law or otherwise unenforceable, it shall be enforced to the extent legally permissible and as necessary to reflect the intent of the Parties and shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
3.4 Variation. No amendment, alteration, addition or variation of the Agreement or any provision or term thereof, or any agreement or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement shall be binding unless recorded in a written document signed by the Parties.

(2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager’s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended.
(b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information.
6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original.
7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.
8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information.
9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.
11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter.
12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies.
14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.)

The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.
15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.
16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement.
17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party will at all times have the right to commence proceedings in any other court of its choice with the appropriate jurisdiction for interim injunctive relief.

Background. The Disclosing Parties may, in their discretion, provide the Receiving Party information related to their confidential and critical energy infrastructure information.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein, and with the intent to be legally bound hereby, the Receiving Party agrees as follows:
1. Confidential Information. The term ""Confidential Information"" means all written, electronic, printed or other materials disclosed by the Disclosing Parties, and all information ascertained through discussions with the Disclosing Parties, concerning the planning process. Confidential Information shall include, but is not limited to, all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, models, ""base cases"", plans, procedures, calculations, reports or other documents prepared by the Disclosing Parties that may contain or reflect such information.
2. Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. The term ""Critical Energy Infrastructure Information"" or ""CEII"" as used in this Agreement refers to the official definition provided in 18 C.F.R. § 388.113(c)(1). CEII shall be protected under the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, CEII shall also include any information which may be described as non-public transmission information including, but not limited to, the following: maps, charts, and diagrams, including location, longitude and latitude for either or both of the Disclosing Parties' electric systems; and system studies including flow studies, models, ""base cases"" and system planning for either or both of the Disclosing Parties. All CEII is also Confidential Information. Given the sensitive nature of CEII, the Receiving Party has a higher duty of care to maintain the confidentiality of this information.
3. Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information.
The Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of its internal evaluation. The Receiving Party shall not make any other use, in whole or in part, of any such Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party.
The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, it shall exercise the same care used to protect its own confidential proprietary information, but no less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. If the Receiving Party is an individual, the Receiving Party may not disclose any Confidential information to any person or entity without the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. If the Receiving Party is a company, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information (i) to the Receiving Party's directors, officers and employees (collectively, ""Representatives""), in each case only to the extent reasonably necessary for the Receiving Party's internal use and only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information and that he or she must comply with such restrictions, and (ii) to any other person or entity only with the Disclosing Parties' prior written consent in each instance. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative.
The Receiving Party shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential and shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose Confidential Information or any reports, work product or other documents containing any Confidential Information to any third party, firm, corporation or entity.
Except as may be required by applicable law, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall not: (a) confirm or deny any statement made by a third party regarding Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII; (b) disclose to any person the fact that Confidential Information and/or CEII/CII have been made available to it; (c) confirm that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place; or (d) disclose any of the terms or conditions with respect to same. If any such actions are required by applicable law, the Receiving Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 5 below.
4. Additional Provisions Relating to Disclosure and Use of CEII.
The Receiving Party shall not use CEII, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than that for which the CEII was specifically provided, without the prior written consent of the respective Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party may make copies of CEII, but such copies become CEII and subject to these same terms and conditions. The Receiving Party shall not knowingly use CEII for an illegal or non-legitimate purpose. The Receiving Party agrees that, in complying with its obligations under this Agreement, it shall employ an enhanced standard of care in order to prevent the disclosure and to protect the confidentiality of the CEII. The Receiving Party shall maintain CEII in a secure manner and place and shall be responsible for ensuring that its Representatives who receive CEII do the same.
The Receiving Party shall not, without the respective Disclosing Party's prior written consent in each instance, disclose CEII or any reports, work product or other documents containing any CEII to any third party, firm, corporation or entity. The Receiving Party may disclose CEII (i) only to its Representatives who have properly executed individual non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in the course of their employment specifically pertaining to confidential information and CEII they receive in the course of their employment and (ii) only after informing each Representative of the restrictions in this Agreement on the disclosure and use of the CEII and that he or she must comply with such restrictions.. Further, such disclosure must be limited to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to evaluate the subject matter of the requested materials. The Receiving Party agrees to take all reasonable steps to cause its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement and to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any Representative. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any CEII to any of its Representatives who have been convicted of any felony.
Except as allowed under Section 5, Required Disclosure, the Receiving Party shall not submit CEII obtained from the Disclosing Parties to any government agency for any reason without first obtaining written permission from the respective Disclosing Party, and then fully complying with the requirements of 18 C.F.R. §§ 388.112, 113 for requesting special treatment of the CEII.
5. Required Disclosure. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or required by depositions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand or similar process (i) to disclose any CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) to disclose any discussions pertaining thereto, or (iii) to take any other action described in the last paragraph of Section 3 above, the Receiving Party shall provide to the relevant Disclosing Parties prompt written notice of such request(s) and shall use reasonable efforts to resist disclosure until an appropriate protective order may be sought. If, in the absence of a protective order, Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the written opinion of its counsel, legally required to disclose CEII or other Confidential Information received pursuant to this Agreement, then, in such event Receiving Party may disclose such information after the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party written notice of the proposed disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure.
6. Return of Documents and Destruction of Electronically Stored Information. Disclosing Parties may elect at any time to terminate further use of or access to the CEII. In such case, the Receiving Party shall return any and all CEII upon the Disclosing Party's written re(cid:84)uest, including all hardcopy originals, copies, translations, notes, reports, schematics, flowcharts, e-mails, tape recordings, or any other form of said material, without retaining any copy or duplicate supplement thereof and shall promptly destroy any and all written, printed or other material or information derived from the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall provide attested certification from an authorized representative confirming such return and destruction ""provided however, Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such documentation in its secure legal files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this agreement, as well as copies of electronically exchanged Confidential Information that are made as a matter of routine information technology back-up, which copies shall continue to be kept confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.""
7. Survival of Obligations. Regardless of any termination of any business relationship between the Parties, the obligations and commitments established by this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
8. Nature of Information; Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party hereby accepts the representations of Disclosing Parties that the CEII disclosed pursuant to this Agreement is of a special, unique, extraordinary, and intellectual character and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its representatives and that specific performance and injunctive or other equitable remedies for any such breach shall be available to it. If there is a breach, then Disclosing Parties shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights and remedies which they may have at law or in equity, to seek to have a decree of specific performance or an injunction issued by any competent court, requiring the breach to be cured or enjoining all persons involved from continuing the breach. The Receiving Party also acknowledges that the interests of Disclosing Parties in such CEII may be irreparably injured by disclosure. The remedy stated above may be pursued in addition to any other remedies applicable at law or equity for breach of this Agreement. The existence of any claim or cause of action which either party may have against the other shall not constitute a defense or bar to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
9. Governing Law. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement and the legal relations of the Receiving Party and Disclosing Parties to it shall be governed by the laws of the State of South Carolina, excluding its conflict of laws principles. Any action arising out of the performance of this Agreement must be filed and resolved exclusively in a state or federal court or tribunal sitting in the State of South Carolina. The parties consent and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of those courts and tribunals.
10. No Other Agreement. The Receiving Party expressly understands that this Agreement is not and shall not be construed as any form of a letter of intent or agreement to enter into any type of transaction. This agreement is to evidence the Receiving Party's agreement to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information/CEII disclosed to it by Disclosing Parties, and shall not constitute any commitment or obligation on the part of either Party to enter into any specific contractual arrangement of any nature whatsoever.
11. No Representation or Warranties. With respect to any information, including but not limited to CEII, which either Disclosing Party furnishes or otherwise disclose to Receiving Party, the Receiving Party understands and agrees that that Disclosing Party does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy, completeness or fitness for a particular purpose thereof. Neither this Agreement, nor the disclosure of CEII hereunder, shall be construed in any way as granting any license or rights to any information or data now or hereafter owned or controlled by Disclosing Parties to Receiving Party and all such Confidential Information/CEII shall remain the property of Disclosing Parties.

Initials:
Other Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU)
As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is an over-arching term that covers any information, not otherwise indicated above, which the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to or modification of could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Section 552a of Title 5, as amended, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This includes information categorized by DHS or other government agencies as: For Official Use Only (FOUO); Official Use Only (OUO); Sensitive Homeland Security Information (SHSI); Limited Official Use (LOU); Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES); Safeguarding Information (SGI); Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI); and any other identifier used by other government agencies to categorize information as sensitive but unclassified.
I attest that I am familiar with, and I will comply with the standards for access, dissemination, handling, and safeguarding of the information to which I am granted access as cited in this Agreement and in accordance with the guidance provided to me relative to the specific category of information.
I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions of my access to the information indicated above:
1. I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination concerning the nature and protection of information to which I have been provided conditional access, including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures.
 2. By being granted conditional access to the information indicated above, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws, regulations, and directives applicable to the specifi c categories of information to which I am granted access.

I understand that the United States Government may conduct inspections, at any time or place, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the conditions for access, dissemination, handling and safeguarding information under this Agreement.
4. I will not disclose or release any information provided to me pursuant to this Agreement without proper authority or authorization. Should situations arise that warrant the disclosure or release of such information I will do so only under approved circumstances and in accordance with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I will honor and comply with any and all dissemination restrictions cited or verbally relayed to me by the proper authority.
5. (a) For PCII - (1) Upon the completion of my engagement as an employee, consultant, or subcontractor under the contract, or the completion of my work on the PCII Program, whichever occurs first, I will surrender promptly to the PCII Program Manager or his designee, or to the appropriate PCII officer, PCII of any type whatsoever that is in my possession.
(2) If the Authorized Entity is a United States Government contractor performing services in support of the PCII Program, I will not request, obtain, maintain, or use PCII unless the PCII Program Manager or Program Manager’s designee has first made in writing, with respect to the contractor, the certification as provided for in Section 29.8(c) of the implementing regulations to the CII Act, as amended.
(b) For SSI and SBU - I hereby agree that material which I have in my possession and containing information covered by this Agreement, will be handled and safeguarded in a manner that affords sufficient protection to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of or inadvertent access to such information, consistent with the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific categories of information. I agree that I shall return all information to which I have had access or which is in my possession 1) upon demand by an authorized individual; and/or 2) upon the conclusion of my duties, association, or support to DHS; and/or 3) upon the determination that my official duties do not require further access to such information.
6. I hereby agree that I will not alter or remove markings, which indicate a category of information or require specific handling instructions, from any material I may come in contact with, in the case of SSI or SBU, unless such alteration or removal is consistent with the requirements set forth in the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the specific category of information or, in the case of PCII, unless such alteration or removal is authorized by the PCII Program Manager or the PCII Program Manager’s designee. I agree that if I use information from a sensitive document or other medium, I will carry forward any markings or other required restrictions to derivative products, and will protect them in the same matter as the original.
7. I hereby agree that I shall promptly report to the appropriate official, in accordance with the guidance issued for the applicable category of information, any loss, theft, misuse, misplacement, unauthorized disclosure, or other security violation, I have knowledge of and whether or not I am personally involved. I also understand that my anonymity will be kept to the extent possible when reporting security violations.
8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to the information covered by this Agreement. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to other types of information, to include classified national security information.
9. (a) With respect to SSI and SBU, I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of the information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
(b) With respect to PCII I hereby assign to the entity owning the PCII and the United States Government, all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result, or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of PCII not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
10. This Agreement is made and intended for the benefit of the United States Government and may be enforced by the United States Government or the Authorized Entity. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government and, with respect to PCII, the Authorized Entity, may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. I understand that if I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I could be subjected to administrative, disciplinary, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws, regulations, or directives applicable to the category of information involved and neither the United States Government nor the Authorized Entity have waived any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that they may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.
11. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter.
12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies.
14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling.
15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law.
16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement.
17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.

Unless defined herein, the definitions in this Agreement shall be the same as those set forth in the Consortium Agreement.
2. Non-disclosure and Restriction on Use
The Receiving Party agrees to retain the Material in confidence and not to use the Material for any purpose other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and of the Consortium Agreement.
In Particular, the Receiving Party undertakes (in addition and without prejudice to any commitments under the Consortium Agreement), that:
a. the Receiving Party shall not disclose the Material to any Third Party except with the Steering Committee’s prior written consent and provided that no other legal disclosure requirement applies;
b. the Material shall neither be copied, nor otherwise reproduced nor duplicated in whole or in part where such copying, reproduction or duplication have not been specifically authorized by the Consortium Agreement or otherwise approved in writing by the Steering Committee;
The Receiving Party acknowledges that the covenants of non-disclosure and non-use in this Agreement shall be effective in every country in the world.
The Receiving Party shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or improper use of the Material, to prevent the material from falling into the public domain, and to protect it from falling into the possession of Third Parties. Such measures include, but shall not be limited to, the highest degree of care that the Receiving Party utilises to protect its own confidential information. In the event of loss or theft of any documents, items of work in progress, or any work products embodying Material, the Consortium Secretariat must be notified immediately by the Receiving Party, who shall cooperate fully in remedying same.

e. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall prevent an Individual Member from supplying Data and/or Studies in its possession or control to a Governmental Authority where required to do so by law or regulation and where refusing to do so would require the Individual Member to violate that law or regulation and subject the Individual Member to fines or other sanction by the Governmental Authority.

In addition, in case of violation of this Agreement, the Receiving Party may be expelled from the Consortium in accordance with the conditions provided in Section 4 of the Consortium Agreement.

Neither party shall disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third parties. If any party makes copies of the Confidential Information of the other party, such copies shall also constitute Confidential Information and any and all confidential markings on such documents shall be maintained.

Maintenance of Confidentiality. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other party.

Each party shall disclose Confidential Information only to those officers, directors, employees and contractors who are required to have the information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business relationship, and such party shall remain responsible for compliance with the terms of this Agreement by its officers, directors, employees and contractors.
No Obligation. Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.
No Warranty. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ""AS IS."" NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.

No License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any patent, mask work right or copyright of the other party, nor shall this Agreement grant any party any rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other party except as expressly set forth herein.
Term. The obligations of each receiving party hereunder shall survive for a period of five years after the disclosure of the Confidential Information or until such time as all Confidential Information of the other party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or inaction of the receiving party, whichever is earlier. Parties agree to honor all patent protections.
Remedies. Each party agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the other party, entitling the other party to seek injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies.
Choice of Laws and Forum. The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, U.S.A., as it applies to a contract executed, delivered, and performed solely in such state. Both PARTIES agree that all disputes concerning the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Florida, U.S.A. Furthermore, both PARTIES hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in the State of Florida, U.S.A., for any dispute arising out of a violation of this Agreement, or any attempt to recover losses incurred on such dispute.

Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 11 will be null and void. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without reference to conflict of laws principles. This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other party except as set forth herein. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement, or any of its terms or provisions, will not affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, which will at all times remain in full force and effect. A failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision. This Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.

2. Except as expressly permitted herein, Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information and shall prevent the disclosure of such information by Recipient or its affiliates and their respective employees, directors, counsel, advisors, agents and independent contractors (all of which collectively ""Representatives"") by using the same degree of care to keep confidential the Confidential Information as it uses to keep confidential its own confidential information. In addition, except as permitted herein, Recipient shall not disclose the fact that the parties are exchanging Confidential Information and having discussions. In connection therewith, it is agreed that no public release or disclosure of any contemplated transaction shall be made except by a mutually agreed disclosure except that each party may make such disclosure if advised by its outside securities counsel in writing that such disclosure is required; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in such event such party will notify the other party that it intends, as a preliminary matter, to take such action and the outside securities counsel of such party shall first discuss the mater with the outside securities counsel of the other party before any definitive decision is made on the disclosure.
3. Recipients shall use Confidential Information solely for the purpose (the ""Permitted Purpose"") specified at the end of this Agreement.
4. Recipient shall disclose Confidential Information only to those of its Representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose.

6. Recipient agrees not to reproduce or copy by any means Confidential Information, except as reasonably required to accomplish such Recipient's Permitted Purpose. Upon written demand by Discloser at any time, Recipient shall return promptly to Discloser or destroy, at Recipient's option, all tangible materials that disclose or embody Confidential Information except that Recipient's counsel may, upon written notice to Disclosure's counsel, retain a single copy of Confidential Information in its records solely for use in dispute resolution or as otherwise required by law. Recipient shall not remove any proprietary rights legend from, and shall, upon Discloser's reasonable written request, add an appropriate proprietary legend to, materials disclosing or embodying Confidential Information.
7. In the event that Recipient is ordered to disclose Discloser's Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or governmental request, requirement or order, Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser and take reasonable steps at Discloser's expense to assist Discloser in contesting such request, requirement or order or otherwise protecting Discloser's rights.
8. Discloser understands that Recipient is an ice cream manufacturer and engaged in distribution (and with arrangements with distributors or subdistributors) and that planned activities in all such areas that are independently developed, pursued or acquired by the Recipient may contain ideas and concepts similar or identical to those contained in Discloser's Confidential Information. Discloser agrees that entering into this Agreement shall not preclude Recipient from developing, pursuing or acquiring projects similar to Discloser's, without obligation to Discloser, provided Recipient does not breach its obligations to Discloser under this Agreement or use the Confidential Information to develop or pursue such projects.

PERSONAL and CONFIDENTIAL
Ms. Donna M. Hitscherich
Vice President
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
60 Wall Street
New York, New York 10260
Dear Ms. Hitscherich:
Carpenter Technology Corporation (""we"", ""our"" or ""us"") has requested information regarding Talley Industries, Inc. (the ""Company"", ""your"" or ""you"") in connection with our consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a ""Possible Transaction""). In consideration of your furnishing us with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) we agree as follows:
Confidentiality of Evaluation Materials
We will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either the Company or its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated (""JPM""), or the Company's other representatives furnish to us in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by us, or by our representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or our review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the ""Evaluation Materials""). We recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.
The term ""Evaluation Materials"" includes information furnished to us orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as ""confidential"". The term ""Evaluation Materials"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by us or our representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to us on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to us by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by us. Use of Evaluation Materials
We will not use any to the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. We and our representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may be disclosed to those of our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, ""our representatives"") who we reasonably determine need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between us and the Company (it being understood that our representatives shall be informed by us of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by us, and shall each agree to treat such information confidentially) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither we nor our representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. We will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by our representatives.
In the event that we or any of our representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, we or our representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) we or our representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which we are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise our best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) we shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by us or our representatives not permitted by this Agreement.
Non-Disclosure
The disclosure of our possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, we agree that prior to the execution of a Sale Agreement with respect to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, we will not, and we will direct our representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between us and the Company or any to the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof unless we are advised by counsel that we are required to make such disclosure. The term ""person"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.
Return of Documents
Upon the Company's request, we shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials.
No Unauthorized Contact
During the course of our evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to JPM or employees or representatives of the Company specified by JPM. Accordingly, we agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express consent of JPM, with the exception of direct communication between our chairman and the Company's chairman. We also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by us and such third party without JPM's prior written consent provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not prevent us from soliciting, on a confidential basis, indications of intent form selected third parties for the purchase of portions of the Company.
For a period of two years following the date hereof, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions with whom you have had contact or who became known to you in connection with your consideration of the Possible Transaction, except that you shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (i) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you, (ii) responds to any public advertisement placed by you, or (iii) has been terminated by the Company or its subsidiaries prior to commencement of employment discussions between you and such officer, director, or employee.
Standstill
We agree that until two years from the date of this Agreement, we will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a ""group"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. No Representation or Warranty
Although the Company and JPM have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of our investigation, we acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied hereunder, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to us or any other person hereunder resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by us or any of our representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (""Sale Agreement"") when, as and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.
We also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between us and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, and we hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto. We also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and us with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Sale Agreement"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by us.
No Solicitation
During the period from acceptance of this agreement until the earlier of (a) the execution of a definitive agreement or (b) the date that is 45 days after the date of such acceptance, the Company and the officers, directors, employees and other representatives of the Company including JPM shall not directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage any offers or proposals for the acquisition of the Company, or of any of the capital stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, from third parties (an ""Acquisition Proposal""). The Company, may, however, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide confidential information to, a third party, if the Chairman of the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice from the Company's financial advisor, that such third party has submitted a bona fide proposal or indication of interest that is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal that is financially superior to the non-binding indication of interest contained in the letter of August 7, 1997 from Robert W. Cardy to Paul L. Foster, provided, however, that the Company agrees to inform us of the receipt of any such proposal.
Legal Remedy
We understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
Other
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.
Very truly yours,

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
Each undersigned party (the ""Receiving Party"") understands that the other party (the ""Disclosing Party"") has disclosed or may disclose information relating to the Disclosing Party's business particularly relating to uniform informer libraries, chemi-informatic tools and the nature of chemical libraries (including, with limitation, names and expertise of employees and consultants, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics, computer programs, software code, algorithms, development tools, manufacturing capability or processes, chemical routes, chemical structures, relationships with other businesses, business plans, and other technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which to the extent previously, presently, or subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party is hereinafter referred to as ""Proprietary Information"" of the Disclosing Party. Proprietary Information also includes any information which the Disclosing Party has received from a third party which the Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential or proprietary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will be considered ""Proprietary Information"" of the Disclosing Party unless either (1) it is first disclosed in tangible form and is conspicuously marked ""Confidential"", ""Proprietary"" or the like or (2) it is first disclosed in non-tangible form and orally identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and is summarized in tangible form conspicuously marked ""Confidential"" within thirty (30) days of the original disclosure.
In consideration of and solely for the purpose of the parties' discussion regarding a possible business transaction and any access the Receiving Party may have to Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, each party (as the Receiving Party) hereby agrees as follows:
1. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Obligations. The Receiving Party agrees (i) to hold the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions the Receiving Party employs with respect to its most confidential materials), (ii) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person (except consultants or agents, subject to the conditions stated below), (iii) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into a proposed business transaction with the Disclosing Party without the prior written permission of the disclosing party, (iv) not to remove or export from the United States or re-export any such Proprietary Information or any direct product thereof except in compliance with all licenses and approvals required under applicable export laws and regulations, including without limitation, those of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and (v) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee, consultant or agent given access to any such Proprietary Information must have a legitimate ""need to know"" and shall be similarly bound in writing. The parties shall be entitled to exchange Proprietary Information under the terms of this Agreement for a period not to exceed two (2) years from the date hereof, unless otherwise extended by mutual written agreement of the parties or incorporated into a separate agreement. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (v) shall not apply with respect to all obligations after five (5) years following the disclosure thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes generally known to the public, (i) was in its possession or the possession of an affiliate or consultant or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it, an affiliate or a consultant by a third party without restriction, or (iv) was independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party by employees of the Receiving Party who can be demonstrated to have had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures required by court order provided the Receiving Party uses diligent efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate in the proceeding.
2. Patent or Copyright Infringement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights under any patent or copyright of the Disclosing Party, nor shall this Agreement grant the Receiving Party any rights in or to the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, except the limited right to review such Proprietary Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible business transaction.
3. Return of Materials. Immediately upon (i) the decision by either party not to enter into a relationship as a result of the exchange of information hereunder, or (ii) a request by the Disclosing Party at any time, the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts or derivatives thereof to the extent it is requested by either party in writing, except that a single copy may be retained for legal archival purposes, subject to protection and non-disclosure in accordance with the term of this agreement. The Receiving Party understands that nothing herein (i) requires the disclosure of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, which shall be disclosed if at all solely at the option of the Disclosing Party, or (ii) requires the Disclosing Party to proceed with any proposed transaction or relationship in connection with which Proprietary Information may be disclosed.
4. No Publicity. Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business relationship contemplated by this Agreement.
5. Securities Law Considerations. Each party is aware, and will advise its employees, consultants and agents who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase and sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
6. Miscellaneous. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any breach of its obligations hereunder, that any such breach may allow the Receiving Party or third parties to unfairly compete with the Disclosing Party resulting in irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the Disclosing Party may seek appropriate equitable relief (without the need to post bond or other security) in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon the occurrence of any such unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be to any extent illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The parties agree that any dispute regarding the interpretation or validity of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in and for the County of San Diego, California, and each party hereby agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. This Agreement supersedes all prior discussions and writings and constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except in an express writing signed by officers of both parties. No waiver or modification of this Agreement will be binding upon either party unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of such party and no failure or delay in enforcing any right will be deemed a waiver.
Each party warrants to the other that it is duly authorized to enter into this Agreement and that the terms of this Agreement are not inconsistent with any of its respective outstanding contractual obligations. The execution and performance of this Agreement does not obligate the parties to enter into any other agreement or to perform any obligations other than as specified herein.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year set forth below.

During the Restricted Period and at all times thereafter, Seller Parties will keep and hold all Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined) in strict confidence, and will not use or disclose in any way any of such Confidential Information without the prior express written consent of the Buyer Parties. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Confidential Information"" shall mean all trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information (and any tangible representation thereof) owned, possessed or used in connection with The Company Business or by the Buyer Parties and its Affiliates; provided, however, that ""Confidential Information"" does not include information which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by a Seller Party..

6. Amendments and Supplements. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties hereto in any manner, except by an instrument in writing signed by the Seller Parties and the Buyer Parties.
7. No Waiver. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by a written instrument signed by the party waiving compliance. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.
8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided herein and shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise.
12. Validity. The Seller Parties have independently consulted with their counsel and after such consultation agree that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and proper.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision of this Agreement shall be severable, and after any such severance, all other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
13. Remedies. Seller Parties recognize that money damages alone would not adequately compensate Buyer Parties and its Affiliates in the event of breach by Seller Parties of this Agreement, and Seller Parties therefore agree that, in addition to all other remedies available to Buyer Parties and its Affiliates, at law, in equity or otherwise, Buyer Parties and its Affiliates shall be entitled to injunctive relief for the enforcement hereof. All rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to and not exclusive of any other rights and remedies available, at law, in equity, by agreement or otherwise.
14. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as an agreement under seal as of the date first written above.

"NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is made and entered into this 30th day of May, 2001 by and between Hai-Perng, aka Alex Kuo (""Covenantor""), and Vertel Corporation, a California corporation (""Buyer""), and is made with reference to the following:
RECITALS
A. The Company is engaged in the business of development and sales of network management software tools that utilize CORBA as the development platform and provides consulting and related services. The Company has offices in California, New Jersey and Texas.
B. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Liquidation, dated May 30, 2001, by and between Trigon Technology Group, Inc., a Texas corporation (the ""Company""), and Buyer (the ""Purchase Agreement""), the Company will sell to Buyer and Buyer will purchase from the Company, substantially all of the assets of the Company together with the goodwill of the Company (the ""Assets"").
B. Covenantor is a shareholder of the Company and has been employed as the Chief Executive Officer and the President of the Company.
C. Covenantor acknowledges that the Company and its employees and shareholders have over several years devoted substantial time, effort and resources to developing the Assets which consist of the Company's trade secrets and its other confidential and proprietary information as well as the Company's relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others doing business with the Company; that such relationships, trade secrets and other information are vital to the successful conduct of the Company's business by Buyer in the future; that because of Covenantor's access to such confidential information and trade secrets, Covenantor would be in a unique position to divert business from Buyer and to commit irreparable damage to Buyer were Covenantor to be allowed to compete with Buyer or to commit any of the other acts prohibited below; that the enforcement of said restrictive covenants against Covenantor would not impose any undue burden upon Covenantor; that none of said restrictive covenants is unreasonable as to period or geographic area; and that the ability to enforce said restrictive covenants against Covenantor is a material inducement to the decision of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Purchase Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual agreements hereinafter set forth and the mutual benefits to be derived therefrom, Covenantor covenants and agrees as follows:
ARTICLE 1
DEFINITIONS
1.1 The term ""Buyer,"" as used herein, means not only Vertel Corporation, but also any company, partnership or entity which (a) directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Vertel Corporation or (b) is a successor-in-interest to Vertel Corporation.
1.2 The term ""Confidential Information"", as used herein, means all information or material not generally known by non-Company personnel constituting Assets and acquired by Buyer under the Purchase Agreement which (i) gives the Company some competitive business advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage or the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the interests of the Company; (ii) which is owned by the Company or in which the Company has an interest and (iii) which is either (A) marked ""Confidential Information,"" ""Proprietary Information"" or other similar marking, (B) known by Covenantor to be considered confidential and proprietary by the Company as of the date hereof or (C) from all the relevant circumstances should reasonably be assumed by Covenantor to be confidential and proprietary to the Company. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, the following types of information and other information of a similar nature (whether or not reduced to writing): trade secrets, inventions, drawings, file data, documentation, diagrams, specifications, know how, processes, formulas, models, flow charts, software in various stages of development, source code, object code, research and development procedures, research or development and test results, marketing techniques and materials, marketing and development plans, price lists, pricing policies, business plans, information relating to customers and/or suppliers' identities, characteristics and agreements, financial information and projections, and employee files. Confidential Information also includes any information described above which the Company obtains from another party and which the Company treats as proprietary or is required to treat as Confidential Information, whether or not owned or developed by the Company. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, HOWEVER, NO INFORMATION CONSTITUTES CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IF IT IS GENERIC INFORMATION OR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE WHICH COVENANTOR WOULD HAVE LEARNED IN
THE COURSE OF SIMILAR EMPLOYMENT ELSEWHERE IN THE TRADE, IF SUCH INFORMATION IS
LAWFULLY AVAILABLE TO COVENANTOR FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE COMPANY, OR IF IT
IS OTHERWISE PUBLICLY KNOWN AND IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
1.3 The term ""Closing"" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Purchase Agreement.
ARTICLE 2
COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE
Covenantor shall not at any time within the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the fourth (4/th/) anniversary of the date hereof (the ""Restricted Period""), have any
ownership interest (of record or beneficial) in or have any interest as an employee, salesman, consultant, officer or director in, or otherwise aid or assist in any manner, any firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship or other business that engages in any California county, or in any other state, country or geographic area, listed in Exhibit ""A"" hereof in a business that is similar to and directly or indirectly offers products or services in competition with the business in which the Company was engaged in such California county, state, country or other geographic area as of the Closing, so long as Buyer, or any successor in interest of Buyer to the business and goodwill of the Company, remains engaged in such business in any such California county, state, country or other geographic area or continues to solicit customers or potential customers therein; provided, however, that Covenantor may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, the securities of any person which are traded on any national securities exchange if Covenantor (i) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such person or (ii) does not, directly or indirectly own two percent (2%) or more of any class of securities of such person. For purposes of this ARTICLE 2, the business activities which may not be engaged in during the Restricted Period by Covenantor or by any firm, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship or other business in which Covenantor has any interest are more particularly described in Exhibit ""B"" hereof.
ARTICLE 3
SOLICITATION OF BUSINESS
During the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not solicit or assist any other person to solicit any business (other than for Buyer) from any present or past customer of the Company; or request or advise any present or future customer of the Company to withdraw, curtail or cancel its business dealings with Buyer; or commit any other act or assist others to commit any other act which might injure the business of Buyer.
ARTICLE 4
EMPLOYEES
During the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage any employee of Buyer to leave the employ of Buyer or (ii) hire any employee who has left the employ of Buyer if such hiring is proposed to occur within one year after the termination of such employee's employment with Buyer.
ARTICLE 5
CONSULTANTS
During the Restricted Period, Covenantor shall not directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any consultant then under contract with Buyer to cease work for Buyer.
ARTICLE 6
NONDISCLOSURE
From and after the Closing, Covenantor shall not (nor will Covenantor assist any other person to do so) directly or indirectly reveal, report, publish or disclose the Confidential Information to any person, firm or corporation not expressly authorized by Buyer to receive such Confidential Information, or use (or assist any person to use) such Confidential Information except for the benefit of Buyer.
ARTICLE 7
OWNERSHIP AND RETURN OF MATERIALS
Upon the termination of Covenantor's employment with Buyer, Covenantor shall immediately surrender to Buyer all notes, data, sketches, drawings, manuals, documents, records, data bases, programs, blueprints, memoranda, specifications, customer lists, financial reports, equipment and all other physical forms of expression incorporating or containing any Confidential Information, it being distinctly understood that all such writings, physical forms of expression and other things are the exclusive property of Buyer. Covenantor acknowledges that the unauthorized taking of any of Buyer's trade secrets is a crime under California Penal Code section 499(c) and is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison or in a county jail for a time not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by both such fine and such imprisonment. Covenantor further acknowledges that such unauthorized taking of Buyer's trade secrets could also result in civil liability under California Civil Code Section 3426, and that willful misappropriation may result in an award against Covenantor for triple the amount of Buyer's damages and Buyer's attorneys fees in collecting such damages.
ARTICLE 8
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UPON BREACH
If Covenantor breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of the provisions of this Agreement (the ""Restrictive Covenants""), Buyer shall have the following rights and remedies, each of which shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Buyer under law or in equity:
8.1 Specific Performance. The right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically enforced or to have any actual or threatened breach thereof enjoined by any court having equity jurisdiction, all without the need to post a bond or any other security or to prove any amount of actual damage or that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer; and
8.2 Accounting and Indemnification. The right and remedy to require Covenantor (i) to account for and pay over to Buyer all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Covenantor or any associated party deriving such benefits as a result of any such breach of the Restrictive Covenants; and (ii) to indemnify Buyer against any other losses, damages (including special and consequential damages), costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, which may be incurred by them and which result from or arise out of any such breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants.
ARTICLE 9
SEVERABILITY OF COVENANTS/BLUE PENCILLING
The Restrictive Covenants shall be subject to Section 12.7 hereof and Covenantor hereby waives any and all right to attack the validity of the Restrictive Covenants on the grounds of the breadth of their geographic scope or the length of their term.
ARTICLE 10
ENFORCEABILITY IN JURISDICTIONS
Buyer and Covenantor intend to and do hereby confer jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants. If the courts of any one or more of such jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants wholly unenforceable by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is the intention of Buyer and Covenantor that such determination not bar or in any way affect the right of Buyer to the relief provided above in the courts of any other jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such covenants, as to breaches of such covenants in such other respective jurisdictions, such covenants as they relate to each jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into diverse and independent covenants.
ARTICLE 11
ATTORNEYS' FEES
In the event of any action, suit, or other proceeding concerning the negotiation, interpretation, validity, performance, or breach of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover all of such party's reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs, not limited to costs of suit, incurred in each and every such action, suit, or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions relating thereto.

12.3 Waiver. The failure of either party hereto at any time to enforce performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect such party's rights thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by either party of any breach of any provision hereof be deemed to be a waiver by such party of any other breach of the same or any other provision hereof.
12.4 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered by courier or other means of personal service (including by means of a nationally recognized courier service or professional messenger service), or sent by facsimile or mailed first class, postage prepaid, by certified mail, return receipt requested, in all cases, addressed to:

B. Samples is a principal stockholder of the Target Company and, as such, will derive substantial benefit from the Merger Transactions.

D. The Merger Agreement provides, as a condition to the Closing thereunder, that Samples shall execute and deliver this Agreement.
E. The agreements of Samples hereunder are an important aspect of the Merger Transactions, and the Acquiror and MergerSub would not consummate the Merger Transactions absent the execution and delivery by Samples of this Agreement.

(iv) enter into any contract or make any commitment to take any action that is restricted by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above.
(d) As used in the foregoing provisions, (i) the term ""Upscale Hotel"" shall mean any hotel or other lodging facility that is a full service hotel or facility of a type that is treated or classified as an ""upscale hotel"" or as part of the ""upscale segment"" of the lodging industry by Smith Travel Research or, if such a classification is not available from Smith Travel Research, by a similar reputable hotel industry service; (ii) the term ""Extended Stay Hotel"" shall mean any hotel or other lodging facility that derives the majority of its business from guests who stay three consecutive nights or longer or that is of a type that is treated or classified as an ""extended stay hotel"" or as part of the ""extended stay segment"" of the lodging industry by Smith Travel Research or, if such a classification is not available from Smith Travel Research, by a similar reputable hotel industry service and (iii) ""Permitted Hotels"" shall mean, collectively, (A) the hotel in Wichita, Kansas operated as of the date hereof as the Wichita Airport Hilton and (B) the hotel in Peoria, Illinois operated as of the date hereof as the Pere Marquette, (C) any upscale all-suites hotel located or to be located adjacent to the Sprint campus in Overland Park, Kansas, (D) the Holiday Inn in Topeka, Kansas, so long as managed under a management contract by Samples or any entity controlled by Samples; (E) if so provided by Section 2(e) below, any three (3) other hotels that, at the time that Samples owns, leases, operates, franchises, licenses, manages, invests in or gives advice in respect of such hotels, have been open and in operation for at least one (1) years, provided that this clause (E) and the similar provision of the Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement of David H. Aull of even date herewith shall collectively not authorize more than a total of three hotels; (F) the Broadway Plaza Suites in Kansas City, Missouri and (G) any Extended Stay Hotel at a specified site if (x) Samples has offered in writing to Acquiror or its designee to develop for Acquiror or such designee an Extended Stay Hotel at such site as a Homegate brand (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates) Extended Stay Hotel in accordance with the procedure set forth below and (y) Acquiror or its designee has either advised Samples that it does not wish to have an Extended Stay Hotel developed at such site as a Homegate (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates) or failed to respond within the time period set forth below. In the case of clause (G) above, Samples' offer shall include a reasonably detailed proposal for the development of the site as an Extended Stay Hotel. Acquiror or its designee shall be given at least thirty (30) days to evaluate such offer and respond to Samples. If Acquiror or its designee fails to respond within such thirty (30) day period or advises Samples that it does not wish to have an Extended Stay Hotel developed at such site as a Homegate (or other extended stay brand maintained by Acquiror, Target Company or their respective affiliates), Samples may develop an Extended Stay Hotel on such site with another party if construction of such Extended Stay Hotel is commenced within 180 days thereafter and is pursued with reasonable diligence thereafter.
(e) If, by July 1, 1998, Samples has not entered into an agreement with the Acquiror (or any successor to or affiliate of the Acquiror or any such successor) concerning the development, franchise or operation of a hotel, then upon such date the definition of Permitted Hotels in Section 2(d) above shall include clause (E) thereof from and after such date. As used in the preceding sentence and in Section 2(f) below, an ""affiliate"" of any person means any other person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such first person.
(f) If, by July 1, 1998 (if the merger of Acquiror into Patriot Hospitality, Inc. provided for in the Patriot-Acquiror Merger Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the""Patriot-Acquiror Merger"") has not occurred by that date) or one (1) year after the closing of the Patriot-Acquiror Merger (if such merger has occurred prior to July 1, 1998), Samples has not entered into an agreement with the Acquiror (or any successor to or affiliate of the Acquiror or any such successor) concerning the development, franchise or operation of a hotel, then upon such date the term of the Restricted Period automatically shall be reduced from five (5) to three (3) years.
(g) Except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, the covenants in this Section 2 are intended to restrict Samples from competing in any manner with the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities or the Business in the activities that have heretofore been carried on by the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities. The obligations set forth in this Section above shall apply to actions by Samples, whether taken directly or indirectly, through any form of ownership, and whether as principal, officer, director, agent, employee, employer, consultant, stockholder or holder of any equity security (beneficially or as trustee of any trust), lender, partner, joint venturer or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever. However, none of the foregoing shall prevent Samples from (i) being the holder of up to 5% in the aggregate of any class of securities of any corporation engaged in the activities described above, provided that such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or reported on NASDAQ or (ii) being the holder of non-convertible debt securities of any entity.
3. Enforcement of Covenants. Samples acknowledges that a violation or attempted violation of any of the covenants and agreements in Section 2 above will cause such damage to the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company and the Related Entities as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, Samples agrees that each of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and any Related Entity shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining such violation or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements by Samples, or the employees, partners or agents of Samples, as well as recover from Samples any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. Samples agrees that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction. Samples further agrees that the Restricted Period shall be tolled during any period of violation thereof by Samples. Any exercise by any one or more of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities of their respective rights pursuant to this Section 3 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies to each of them may be entitled.
4. Intellectual Property. Samples recognizes and agrees that, on and after the date hereof, he will not have the right to use for his own account any of the service marks, trademarks, trade names, licenses, labels, trade secrets or customers' lists owned by or licensed to the Acquiror Companies, the Target Company or any of the Related Entities.
5. Consideration. As consideration for Samples' agreements provided herein, the Acquiror agrees to pay to Samples the total sum of $500,000, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the date hereof. Samples also acknowledges and agrees that, in addition thereto, he has received substantial consideration and benefit, direct and indirect, pursuant to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
6. Validity. Samples acknowledges and agrees that each of the covenants contained herein is a reasonable limitation as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained and does not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other interests of the Acquiror Companies and the Target Company and the Related Entities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if it should ever be held that any provision contained herein does not contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area or scope of activity to be restrained, then the court so holding shall at the request of any of the Acquiror Companies or the Target Company or any Related Entity reform such provisions to the extent necessary to cause them to contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained and to give the maximum permissible effect to the intentions of the parties as set forth herein; and the court shall enforce such provisions as so reformed. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision hereof is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws effective during the term hereof, such provision shall be fully severable; this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof; and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or enforceable provision or by its severance here from. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically by the Acquiror and the Target Company as a part hereof a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable, and the parties hereby agree to such provision.
7. Waiver of Breach. The waiver by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by any party.
8. Tax Reporting. The parties hereby expressly agree that the consideration given and received pursuant to this Agreement shall, for income tax purposes, be reported as amounts paid for a covenant not to compete. The parties acknowledge that Samples shall be solely responsible for the payment of any federal, state or local taxes arising from his receipt of the consideration under this Agreement.

Any notice, request, instruction, document or other communication to be given hereunder by any party hereto to any other party hereto shall be in writing and validly given if (i) delivered personally, (ii) sent by telecopy, (iii) delivered by overnight express, or (iv) sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, as follows:

"AMENDED AND RESTATED
MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Amended and Restated Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (""Agreement"") is entered into as of March 1, 1998 between TWENTIETH CENTRUTY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT, INC. (""Company"") (collectively, ""Parties""). This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement previously entered into by the Parties. The Parties will provide each other with Confidential Information as defined below in connection with one or more possible or actual transactions between the Parties (each a ""Transaction""). As a condition of one of the Parties or its agents or its representatives furnishing Confidential Information (""Furnishing Party"") to the other of the Parties or its agents or its representatives receiving Confidential Information (""Receiving Party""), the Receiving Party shall treat the Confidential Information confidentially as set forth below.
1. ""Confidential Information"" shall mean all non-public proprietary information provided by the Furnishing Party to the Receiving Party, whether or not marked or otherwise specifically designated as confidential. The term ""Confidential Information"" does not include information which (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party, (ii) was available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior the Furnishing Party's disclosure to the Receiving Party, or (iii) becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party, provided that such source is, to the best of the Receiving Party's knowledge, not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Furnishing Party or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Furnishing Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation.
2. It is understood that the Receiving Party may disclose any of the Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's (and its subsidiaries' and affiliates') directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys and financial advisors), and prospective bank or institutional lenders, (collectively, ""Representatives"") who require such material in connection with a possible or actual Transaction (provided that such Representatives shall be informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to act in accordance with the terms hereof). The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information of the Furnishing Party will be kept confidential by the Receiving Party and its Representatives and, except with the specific prior written consent of the Furnishing Party, or as expressly otherwise permitted by the terms hereof, will not be disclosed by the Receiving Party or its Representatives. The Parties further agree that the Receiving Party and its Representatives will not use any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose other than in connection with a possible or actual Transaction.
3. Company acknowledges and agrees that certain Confidential Information is extremely competitively sensitive for Fox (""Highly Confidential Information"") and shall therefore be subject to restrictions on disclosure additional to those applicable to other Confidential Information. Highly Confidential Information shall include the identity of Fox's actual and potential customers and vendors; Fox's release schedules and sales trends; the prices and pricing policies of Fox, its vendors and customers; all customer shipment, point-of-sale and returns information; Fox's strategic planning information regarding system implementation (including geographic implementation) and process improvement; all distribution software used by and software development performed for Fox; Fox's replenishment schedules and processes, inventory management schedules and processes; and any other competitively sensitive Confidential Information designated by Fox from time to time as ""Highly Confidential Information"". Company shall limit disclosure of Highly Confidential Information to Company employees. Company shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any such employee. Company shall not disclose Highly Confidential Information to any of its consultants, or other vendors, or agents.
4. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested or required by applicable Federal or State law of the United States to disclose any of the Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Receiving Party or its Representative, as the case may be, will provide the Furnishing Party with prompt notice of such request(s) so that it may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance by the Receiving Party or its Representative with the provisions of the Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Furnishing Party grants a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party or such Representative of the Receiving Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which it is legally compelled to disclose and will exercise its best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any Confidential Information so furnished.
5. Without the prior written consent of Company, (i) neither Fox nor those of its Representatives who are aware of the Confidential Information of Company will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of Company concerning the Confidential Information, and (ii) none of Fox's directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information will, for the two-year period from the date of the Agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any employee of Company who is aware of the Confidential Information of Company.
6. Without the prior written consent of Fox, (i) neither Company nor those of its Representatives who are aware of the Confidential Information of Fox will initiate or cause to be initiated any communications with any employee of Fox concerning the Confidential Information, and (ii) none of Company's directors, officers or employees who are aware of the Confidential Information will, for the two-year period from the date of the Agreement, solicit or cause to be solicited for employment any employee of Fox who is aware of the Confidential Information of Fox.
7. Upon providing the Receiving Party with a specific list of the Confidential Information to be returned to the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly deliver to the Furnishing Party or its Representatives, the Confidential Information listed, together with all copies thereof, in the possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives, which was actually furnished by the Furnishing Party to the Receiving Party.
8. Although the Receiving Party understands that the Furnishing Party has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information information known to it which it believes to be relevant to a possible or actual Transaction, the Receiving Party further understands that neither the Furnishing Party nor its Representatives make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Furnishing Party nor its Representatives shall have any liability to Receiving Party or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by the Receiving Party or its Representatives.
9. The provisions set forth in this Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing signed by the Parties expressly so modifying or waiving such provisions.
10. The Receiving Party hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Furnishing Party from any damage, loss, cost or liability (including legal fees and the cost of enforcing this indemnity) arising out of, or resulting from, any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party also acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives and that any such breach would cause the Furnishing Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Receiving Party also
agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the Furnishing Party, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity it may have, shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance.
11. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
12. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity of enforceability of any other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the rights and benefits thereof shall be assigned by the party to any purchaser of a controlling share of equity in that party.
13. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
14. The Parties hereby represent and warrant that the undersigned officer is authorized to execute this Agreement on its behalf.

(e) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.
(f) If either Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of the State of Washington, and the parties further consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior of King County, Washington.

(g) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party's respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that neither party may assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of the other party.

(h) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
(i) Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party.

Both parties agree that all Feedback is and shall be given entirely voluntarily. Feedback, even if designated as confidential by the party offering the Feedback, shall not, absent a separate written agreement, create any confidentiality obligation for the receiver of the Feedback. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided herein or in a separate subsequent written agreement between the parties, the receiver of the Feedback shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.

(a) The Receiving Party hereby agrees that the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives will use Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party solely for the purpose of evaluating and negotiating a Possible Transaction with the Disclosing Party and for no other purpose, and that such Confidential Information will not be used in any way detrimental to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party further agrees that it will and will cause its Representatives to take those steps the Receiving Party takes to protect its own similar proprietary and confidential information (which will not be less than a reasonable standard of care) to keep the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party confidential; provided, however, that (i) the Receiving Party may make any disclosure of the Confidential Information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent and (ii) any of the Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Receiving Party’s Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction, who are provided with a copy of this Agreement and who agree to be bound by the terms this Agreement. The Parties will maintain a list of those Representatives to whom Confidential Information has been disclosed (which list will be presented to the Party upon the other Party’s request). In any event, the Receiving Party agrees to undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, to accept responsibility for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives, and, at the Receiving Party’s sole expense, to take all reasonable measures (including court proceedings) to restrain the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or uses of the Confidential Information.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:
(i) the Receiving Party or its Representatives may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if required in order to establish its rights under this Agreement, but only to the extent such disclosure is necessary and provided that the Receiving Party seeks confidential treatment of the Confidential Information to be disclosed;
(ii) this Agreement will not prohibit or restrict either Party’s right to develop, make, use, market, license or distribute products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other Party disclosed in the Confidential Information as long as such Party does not thereby breach this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other Party disclosed in the Confidential Information; and
(iii) either Party will be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or work with Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. The term “residuals” means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information so long as such persons have not studied the information for the purpose of replicating the same from memory. Neither Party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals.
(c) Each Party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other Party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person the fact that the other Party or its Representative have received Confidential Information or that Confidential Information has been made available to the other Party or its Representatives, that investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any Possible Transaction, including the status this Agreement and the identity of the parties hereto (collectively, the “Discussion Information”), provided that the Receiving Party may make such disclosure if required by law or the applicable rules of any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system. The Potential Relationship Party further agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or denied), the Potential Relationship Party and the Potential Relationship Party’s Representatives will not, directly or indirectly, consult or share Confidential Information or Discussion Information with, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or any discussions which might lead to any such agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any co-investor, source of equity financing or other person (other than the Company) regarding a Possible Transaction, including discussions or other communications with any prospective bidder for the Company with respect to (i) whether or not the Receiving Party or such other prospective bidder will make a bid or offer for the Disclosing Party or (ii) the price that the Receiving Party or such other bidder may bid or offer for the Disclosing Party.
(d) To the extent that any Confidential Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the Parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and will not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by a Party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege will remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any Party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.
Section 4. Required Actions if Disclosure is Legally Sought or Compelled. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may in its sole discretion seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives are nonetheless, in the written opinion of outside legal counsel, legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information or Discussion Information to any tribunal, the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Confidential Information or Discussion Information which such counsel advises the Receiving Party is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Receiving Party will use the Receiving Party’s reasonable best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and the Discussion Information, including by cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information and the Discussion Information by such tribunal; and provided further that the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party of (i) the Receiving Party’s determination to make such disclosure and (ii) the nature, scope and contents of such disclosure.
Section 5. Return and Destruction of Confidential Information.

In the event of such a decision or request, all other Confidential Information prepared by the Receiving Party or on the Receiving Party’s behalf will be returned or destroyed and, upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written confirmation of the Receiving Party’s compliance with this paragraph; provided, however, that
(a) if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Confidential Information, such material will not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered;
(b) the Receiving Party will not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Confidential Information held electronically in archive or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or backup policies and further provided that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use reasonable measures to cause its employees not to, access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up;
(c) the Receiving Party will not be obligated to return or destroy Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to retain a copy pursuant to applicable law; and
(d) one copy of all Confidential Information may be kept by the Receiving Party’s outside counsel, if any, and such Confidential Information shall be fully protected by attorney-client privilege.
Notwithstanding the return, destruction or continued possession pursuant to the terms of this Section 5 of the Confidential Information, the Receiving Party and the Receiving Party’s Representatives will continue to be bound by the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and other obligations and agreements hereunder.

Each Patty understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for any Possible Transaction will be deemed to exist between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including breach of contract) in connection with any Possible Transaction unless and until the Parties will have entered into a final definitive agreement. The Parties also agree that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The Company further reserves the right, in its sole discretion, with due notice to reject any and all proposals made by the Potential Relationship Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Possible Transaction to determine not to engage in discussions or negotiations and to terminate discussions and negotiations with the Potential Relationship Party at any time, and to conduct, directly or through any of its Representatives, any process for any transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, if and as they in their sole discretion determine (including negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to the Potential Relationship Party or any other person). Section 7. Representations and Warranties. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it has the right to enter into this Agreement and that this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of such Party relating to the matters herein. Each Party further represents and warrants that the terms of this Agreement are not inconsistent with other contractual obligations, express or implied, which such Party may have or any law applicable to such Party or its business. The Receiving Party understands, acknowledges and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information by virtue of this Agreement. The Receiving Party agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Receiving Party or to any of the Receiving Party’s Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom.
Section 8. Material Non-Public Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Receiving Party is aware (and that the Receiving Party’s Representatives are aware or, upon receipt of any Confidential Information or Discussion Information, will be advised by the Receiving Party) that (a) the Confidential Information being furnished to the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s Representatives contains material, non-public information regarding the Disclosing Party and (b) the United States and other non-U.S. securities laws prohibit any persons who have material, nonpublic information concerning the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, including the Discussion Information, from purchasing or selling securities of a company which may be a party to a transaction of the type contemplated by this Agreement or from communicating such information to any person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
Section 9. No Solicitation. In consideration of the Confidential Information being furnished hereunder, each Party agrees that, for a period of six months from the date of this Agreement, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment with such Party or any of its Affiliates, any of the officers or employees of the other Party or its Affiliates (a) with whom such Party has had contact during the evaluation of a Possible Transaction or (b) who were identified by name and function to such Party by an officer or employee of the other Party with whom such Party or its Representatives had contact during the evaluation of a Possible Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, employees whose names are provided by the other Party in response to a request made by such Party or its Representatives during the evaluation of a Possible Transaction are covered by this non-solicitation obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict or preclude either Party from (i) making generalized searches for employees (by use of advertisements in the media, the engagement of search firms or otherwise), (ii) continuing its ordinary course hiring practices that are not targeted specifically at employees of the other Party, (iii) hiring an employee of the other Party who first initiates an employment discussion with such Party, in each case, so long as such Party has not violated the restrictions on solicitation contained in this Agreement or (iv) if the employee is no more on the rolls of the Party.
Section 10. Standstill.

(d) The Potential Relationship Party agrees that, if at any time during the Standstill Period, the Potential Relationship Party or any of the Potential Relationship Party’s Affiliates or subsidiaries or Representatives acting on the Potential Relationship Party’s behalf are approached by any third party concerning the Potential Relationship Party’s or their participation in a transaction involving any assets, indebtedness or business of, or securities issued by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the Potential Relationship Party will promptly inform the Company of the nature of such transaction and the parties involved.

Alexander Dunham Securities, Inc.
350 S. Grand
Suite 3570
Los Angeles, CA 90071
Dear Steven:
You have requested information regarding Home Products International, Inc. (the “Company”, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is referred to herein as “us” or “we”) in connection with your consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a “Possible Transaction”). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:
Confidentiality of Evaluation Materials
You will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, Mesirow Financial, Inc. (“Mesirow”), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives (as defined hereinafter) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the “Evaluation Materials”). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this agreement
The term “Evaluation Materials” includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as “confidential”. The term “Evaluation Materials” does not include information which, you establish through written documentation, (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you without violating your obligations hereunder. The terms of this section “Confidentiality of Evaluation Materials” shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.
Use of Evaluation Materials
You will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), and lenders (collectively, “your representatives”) who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you, and shall each expressly agree (in writing, if requested by the Company or its advisors), to treat such information confidential in accordance with the agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated, neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. In any event, neither you nor any of your representatives will use the Evaluation Materials in any way which is or may be detrimental to the Company. You will be responsible for any breach of this agreement by you or your representatives. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company reserves the right not to make available hereunder any information, the provision of which is determined by us, in our sole discretion, to be inadvisable or inappropriate or competitively sensitive.
In the event that you or any of your representatives received a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials. The terms of this section “Use of Evaluation Materials” shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.
Non-Disclosure
The disclosure of your possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated or a disclosure is made prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law or regulatory authority, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person (including, but not limited to, any customer, employee, supplier, creditor or competitor of the Company) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof, nor will you or any of your representatives make inquiry about the Company’s business to any customer, employee, supplier, creditor or competitor of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you further agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding or any discussions that any lead to such agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person (other than the Company) regarding a Possible Transaction. The term “person” as used in this agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, limited liability company, association or individual. The terms of this section “Non-Disclosure” shall remain in effect for 2 years from the effective date of this agreement.
Securities Law Compliance
You acknowledge that the Evaluation Materials represent, in part, material, non-public information regarding the Company and its prospects. Accordingly, you acknowledge that you and your representatives understand that the securities laws of the United States prohibit any person who has material, non-public information concerning the Company or a Possible Transaction from purchasing or selling securities in reliance upon such information or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
Return of Documents
Upon the Company’s request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company.
No Unauthorized Contact or Solicitation
During the course of your evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to Mesirow or employees or representatives of the Company specified by Mesirow. Accordingly, you and your representatives agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express written consent of Mesirow. You also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by you and such third parry without the prior written consent of the Company.
Without the Company’s prior written consent, neither you nor any of your affiliates will for a period of two years from the date of this agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment or employ any of the officers or employees of the Company (or any person whose activities are dedicated to the Company).
Standstill
You agree that until two years from the date of this agreement, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, neither you nor any of your representatives will (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger.

CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT FOR STRATEGIC MATTERS
This Confidential Disclosure Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into as of the effective date listed below (“Effective Date”) by Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) located at 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and the company designated below (“Company”).
Oracle and the Company are entering into discussions concerning a possible strategic transaction (the “Transaction”). The parties expect to make available to one another certain non-public, confidential and/or proprietary information, both oral and written, which may include information concerning their respective business prospects and plans, financial condition, technology, customers, know-how, trade secrets, operations, assets and liabilities (collectively, the “Evaluation Material”). As a condition to each party furnishing the Evaluation Material to the other party and the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors of such party or its subsidiaries (collectively, “Representatives”), each party agrees that the Evaluation Material furnished to it hereunder shall be treated as confidential subject to the terms of this Agreement.
1. Evaluation Material. “Evaluation Material” also includes notes, analyses, compilations, studies, plans, interpretations or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives which contain or are based upon the Evaluation Material furnished to such party hereunder. The term “Evaluation Material” does not include information that (i) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) is or becomes available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party or any of its Representatives, provided that such source was not known or reasonably should be known by the receiving party to be bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to such information; (iii) is disclosed by the disclosing party to a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the Evaluation Material; or (v) is disclosed under operation of law.
2. Non-Disclosure/Security/Use. Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person any of the other party’s Evaluation Material, the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, or any terms or other facts relating to the Transaction and will use such Evaluation Materials only for the purpose of evaluating a Transaction. Each party agrees to use reasonable measures to protect against the loss, theft or unauthorized use of the Evaluation Materials.
3. Personally Identifiable Information. The Evaluation Materials may include human resources data and/or other information that serves to identify one or more individuals (“PII”). The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any request received by the receiving party for access, correction, amendment or redaction of any PII. The disclosing party shall be responsible for compliance with all such requests. The receiving party also agrees to notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected improper acquisition of PII of which the receiving party becomes aware.
4. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit either party’s ability to use “residuals” relating to the Evaluation Material of the other party. The term “residuals” shall mean information included in the Evaluation Material in nontangible form (i.e., not written or other documentary form, including tape or disk), which is incidentally retained in the memories of employees of either party who have had access to the Evaluation Material, including ideas, know-how, or techniques contained therein, and where the source of the Evaluation Material has become remote (e.g., as a result of the passage of time or the employee’s subsequent exposure to information of a similar nature from other sources) that the employee in good faith believes that it is not Evaluation Material. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its employees or to pay royalties to the other party in connection with any use of residuals.
5. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or preclude either party from developing, using, marketing, licensing, and/or selling any independently developed software, technology or other materials similar or related to the Evaluation Material without otherwise violating this Agreement.
6. Required Disclosure. In the event that a party or its Representatives is required by Law, rule or stock exchange regulation to disclose any of the other party’s Evaluation Material or the fact that discussions between the parties are taking place concerning the Transaction, the party required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other party with prior written notice of any such requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order, other remedy or waiver is not obtained, the party required to make the disclosure shall furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material that such party determines, alter consulting with counsel, is required to disclose and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the other party’s Evaluation Material.
7. Termination of Discussions. This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date. Promptly upon notice from either party that it does not wish to proceed with the Transaction, each party shall return to the other party or destroy all copies of the Evaluation Material (including all documents based thereon) in its possession or in the possession of its Representatives, except that outside counsel to the receiving party may retain one copy of the Evaluation Material for archival purposes and solely to comply with applicable law, rule or regulation. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for a period ending on the second anniversary of the Effective Date.
8. Definitive Agreements. Unless and until a final definitive agreement, regarding the Transaction has been executed, no contract or agreement with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties and neither party will be under any legal obligation whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The term “definitive agreement” does not include a term sheet or any other preliminary written agreement. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not provide Evaluation Material under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals with regard to the Transaction and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.

Any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in any state or federal court In San Francisco or San Mateo County, California. Company and Oracle irrevocably and unconditionally agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and agree that the venue is proper in, the aforesaid courts in any such legal action or proceeding.

Such remedies shall not be deemed to be exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.

 This Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement (the ""Agreement"") is entered into as of this 7th day of March, 2001, by and between Polycom, Inc. (""Polycom""), and PictureTel Corporation (""PictureTel""), a Delaware corporation.
WITNESSETH:
 WHEREAS, Polycom and PictureTel may consider engaging in discussions with respect to a possible negotiated business combination involving PictureTel and Polycom or their respective subsidiaries (the ""Transaction"") and, prior to or during the course of any such discussions, PictureTel and Polycom each may have disclosed or, in the future, may disclose and make available to the other certain information concerning its business prospects, financial condition, operations, assets and liabilities;
 WHEREAS, all such information furnished to a party or its Representatives (as defined below) by or on behalf of the other party (irrespective of the form of communication and whether such information is so furnished before, on or after the date hereof), and all analyses, compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other documents prepared by a party or its Representatives containing or based in whole or in part on any such furnished information are collectively referred to herein as the ""Confidential Information;"" and
 WHEREAS, each of Polycom and PictureTel hereby agrees to receive such Confidential Information of the other and to disclose such Confidential Information to the other subject to the following terms and conditions.
 NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
 1. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. (a) Each of PictureTel and Polycom shall (i) use the Confidential Information obtained from the other solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, executive officers and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers, consultants and attorneys) acting on its behalf (collectively, its ""Representatives"") who in each case, in such party's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and who are set forth on Annex A hereto, as it may be amended by the parties from time to time; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.
 (b) If either party is required (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that such party will provide the other party with prompt notice of such request so that such other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the notifying party's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order, either party is nonetheless compelled to disclose Confidential Information, such party may disclose, without liability hereunder, only that portion of the Confidential Information that such party is advised in writing by outside legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that such party gives to the other party written notice of the portion of the Confidential Information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and, upon such other party's request, uses reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information.
 2. Non-Disclosure of Negotiations or Agreements. Except as required by law, neither PictureTel, Polycom nor their respective Representatives shall disclose to any person (including, without limitation, any director, officer or employee that is not set forth on Annex A) the existence, status or terms of any discussions, negotiations or agreements between them concerning a possible Transaction, including without limitation any offer, letter of intent, proposal, price, value or valuation, or any similar terms, agreements or understandings between PictureTel and Polycom with respect thereto, or that such party has provided to or received from the other Confidential Information, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. The term ""person"" as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include the media and any corporation, company, group, partnership or other entity or individual.
 3. Ownership of Confidential Information. Each party shall keep a reasonable record of the Confidential Information received by it and the location of such Confidential Information. All written Confidential Information delivered by one party hereto to the other party pursuant to the Agreement shall be and remain the property of the delivering party, and upon the written request of the delivering party, the receiving party shall (i) promptly return such Confidential Information and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions or extracts thereof, (ii) destroy or have destroyed all memoranda, notes, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, or other documents derived from or containing Confidential Information, and all copies and other reproductions and extracts thereof, and (iii) provide a certificate to the delivering party certifying that the foregoing materials have, in fact, been destroyed or returned, signed by an authorized officer supervising such destruction or return. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.

Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this Section 9 shall not apply to a party in the event of a bona fide publicly announced proposal, offer or agreement by a third party not acting in concert with such party (i) to acquire more than 51% of any class of stock (or rights in respect thereof) of the other party or (ii) to acquire the other party, or all or substantially all of its assets, by means of a merger, consolidation, asset purchase or other similar transaction. Additionally, the Principal or President of a party may contact the Principal or President of the other party for the purpose of expressing continuing or renewed interest in a Transaction, provided that, unless invited to do so by the President of the other party, no offer or proposal shall be made that would require public disclosure or formal consideration by such other party or its Board of Directors.
 10. No Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. Any waiver of a breach hereof shall be in writing and shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
 11. Remedies. Each party agrees to indemnify the other party from any damages, loss, cost or liability (including, without limitation, legal fees and the cost of enforcing this Agreement) arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosures of any Confidential Information by the other party or its Representatives.

Each party agrees to waive, and to use its best efforts to cause its directors, officers, employees or agents to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

 12. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and agents and their respective successors and assigns and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal substantive laws and not the choice of law rules of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same Agreement.
 14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found to violate any statute, regulation, rule, order, decision or decree of any governmental authority, court, agency or exchange, such invalidity shall not be deemed to affect any other provision hereof or the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, and such invalid provision shall be deemed deleted herefrom to the minimum extent necessary to cure such violation.

If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Recipient hereby acknowledges and agrees that no remedy at law will afford Discloser adequate protection against, or appropriate compensation for, breach of Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement.

You will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to safeguard Evaluation Material from disclosure by you or your Representatives to anyone other than as permitted hereby by using, in all material respects, the same degree of care that you use to protect your own confidential, proprietary information. You agree to be responsible for any failure by your Representatives to comply with this Agreement (including, without limitation, any actions or inactions by your Representatives that would constitute a breach if such Representatives were original signatories hereto (other than with respect to paragraph 7 below under the heading “Non-Solicitation and Non-Hire of Employees”)).

No Obligation, Representation or Warranty
14. This Agreement defines the duties and obligations of you and your Representatives with respect to the Evaluation Material to the extent it may be disclosed or made available but does not constitute or create any obligation of the Company or its Representatives to provide any Evaluation Material or other information to you. Under no circumstances will the Company or any of its Representatives be obligated to disclose or make available any information, including, without limitation, any Evaluation Material, which the Company in its sole and absolute discretion determines not to disclose. Except for any express representations and warranties set forth in a definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement, you understand and acknowledge that none of the Company or any of their respective Representatives is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you or your Representatives by or on behalf of the Company, and none of the Company or any of their respective Representatives will have any liability to you or any other person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) resulting from your use of the Evaluation Material or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, except as may otherwise be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.
15. You acknowledge and agree that neither you nor the Company, nor any of either party’s Representatives, will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Transaction by virtue of (i) this Agreement or (ii) any written or oral expression or communication with respect to any Transaction by any of the Company’s Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein.

Term
16. Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate eighteen (18) months from the date hereof, provided that such termination will not relieve any party from its responsibilities in respect of any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

Legal Remedy
18. You acknowledge that money damages and remedies at law may be inadequate to protect the Company against any actual or threatened breach of or failure to comply with this Agreement by you or by your Representatives and, without prejudice to any rights and remedies otherwise available to the Company, you may agree to the seeking of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in the Company’s favor, and you further agree to waive, and to cause your Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy.
Governing Law
19. The validity and interpretation of this Agreement will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles.

21. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. You may not assign this Agreement or any part hereof without the prior written consent of the Company, and any purported assignment without such consent will be null and void.

g. “Solicit”, “Solicited” or “Solicitation” means any direct or indirect communication of any kind whatsoever, regardless of by whom initiated, inviting, advising, inducing, encouraging, enticing, or requesting either expressly or implicitly, any Person, in any manner, to take or refrain from taking action, provided, however, this definition does not include communications initiated by Customers or Potential Customers of their own initiative, without prompting or encouragement by Employee or anyone acting on Employee’s behalf.
4. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. During the course of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution, Employee agrees that Employee has or will continue to become knowledgeable about, or come to be in possession of, Confidential Information. If such Confidential Information were to be divulged or become known to any competitor of a Banking Organization, or to any other Person outside of a Banking Organization, or if Employee were to consent to be employed by any competitor of a Banking Organization, or to engage in competition with a Banking Organization, such Banking Organization will be harmed. In addition, Employee has or may develop relationships with Customers or Potential Customers so that the Confidential Information could be used to Solicit the business of such Customer or Potential Customer away from a Banking Organization.
Employee shall not, directly or indirectly, use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the benefit of a Banking Organization, and shall not directly or indirectly, disclose, communicate, deliver, exhibit or provide any Confidential Information to any Person, except other Employees or Agents of a Banking Organization who have a need to know such Confidential Information for a proper corporate or business purpose, as required in the normal course of Employee’s service as an employee. Nothing in this Section 4, or any other provision of this Agreement, shall be construed to prohibit Employee from reporting conduct to, providing truthful information to, or participating in any investigation or proceeding brought or conducted by any federal or state government agency or self-regulatory organization.
Employee specifically acknowledges that the Confidential Information, whether reduced to writing or maintained electronically or in the mind or memory of Employee and, whether compiled by a Banking Organization and/or the Employee, derives independent economic value from not being readily known to or ascertainable by proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, that reasonable efforts have been put forth by each Banking Organization to maintain the secrecy of such information, that such information is the sole property of such Banking Organization and that any retention and/or use of such information during or after Employee’s employment with either Financial Institution (except in the course of performing the Employee’s duties of employment with a Financial Institution and except as otherwise set forth above) constitutes a misappropriation of a Banking Organization’s Confidential Information.
Employee agrees that all Confidential Information and all records, documents and materials relating to all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of a Banking Organization, and upon Employee’s termination of employment, all such Confidential Information, whether in paper or electronic form, shall be returned to a Financial Institution in good condition, without Employee retaining a copy thereof, including, but not limited to, retaining an electronic copy on any electronic device regardless of whether such device is owned by Employee. At a Financial Institution’s request, Employee shall provide written verification, under the penalties for perjury, of his/her compliance with this covenant.
5. Non-Solicitation of Customers and Potential Customers. Employee acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of Employee’s position with a Banking Organization, Employee has or will have advantageous familiarity and personal contacts with Customers and Potential Customers and will have advantageous familiarity with the business operations and affairs of a Banking Organization. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been or will be placed in a position that, were Employee to leave a Financial Institution to compete with the business of a Banking Organization, such entity from which the Employee departed would, upon violation of this Agreement, suffer irreparable harm and financial loss, as well as lost goodwill and Confidential Information. Therefore, in consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution, and for a period of one (1) year immediately following the termination of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution (“Restriction Period”), for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee’s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee’s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:
a. Solicit, divert, or take away (or attempt to Solicit, divert or take away) any Banking and Financial Services to or from any Customer or Potential Customer; or
b. advise, persuade or induce (or attempt to advise, persuade or induce) any Customer or Potential Customer to terminate, reduce, limit, or change the Customer’s services or business relationship, or the Potential Customer’s contemplated services or business relationship, with a Financial Institution; or
c. directly provide Banking and Financial Services to, or directly accept Banking and Financial Services from, any Customer or Potential Customer.
This Agreement is not intended to prevent Employee from accepting employment with an organization that competes with the Banking Organizations by offering Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers. The Parties acknowledge that Employee may be associated with such an Organization and that such association may place Employee in a senior or supervisory role to those in the organization that have contact with Customers or Potential Customers. Employee shall not be in violation of this Agreement merely by engaging in such a role, which may include:
a. supervising those who provide Banking and Financial Services to Customers or Potential Customers;
b. engaging in credit review, underwriting, loan approval, or financial analysis of a Customer or Potential Customer’s business as a part of a supervisory or management role, so long as such activity does not require the disclosure of Confidential Information, direct contact with the Customer or Potential Customer, or the disclosure of Employee’s role to the Customer or Potential Customer;
c. performing or supervising those that perform data processing, accounting, rate review, document review or similar “back room” services related to a Customer or Potential Customer so long as the services do not require the disclosure of Confidential Information or contact with the Customer or Potential Customer.
6. Non-Solicitation of Employees and Others. In consideration of the covenants of all Financial Institutions contained herein, Employee agrees that during Employee’s employment with a
Financial Institution, and for a period of two (2) years immediately following the termination of Employee’s employment with a Financial Institution, for whatever reason and regardless of how Employee’s employment was terminated, Employee shall not, directly or indirectly (including, but not limited to, through other individuals, any partnership, corporation or business entity in which Employee has an ownership interest or serves as an officer, employee, independent contractor, representative, agent or consultant), either for Employee’s own benefit or the benefit of any other Person:
c. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Employee to terminate his or her employment with a Banking Organization, or offer or provide employment (whether such employment is with Employee or any other Person) either on a full-time or part-time, consulting or Independent Contractor basis; or
d. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any Independent Contractors or Agents to terminate their contract or relationship with a Banking Organization or discontinue providing services to a Banking Organization and/or Customers; or
e. Solicit, entice or persuade (or attempt to Solicit, entice or persuade) any suppliers, vendors or others who were supplying services or goods to a Banking Organization during the one year period prior to Employee’s termination, to terminate, reduce, limit or change their business or relationship with a Banking Organization.
7. Tolling of Covenants. Employee acknowledges that a Banking Organization is entitled to the full post-termination restrictions on the activities set forth in Sections 5 and 6, as applicable. Therefore, in the event any of the provisions of these Sections are breached by Employee, the commencement of the applicable post-termination restriction will not begin until Employee is in full compliance with Section 5 and/or 6.
8. Severability/Blue Pencil. Each of the provisions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the restrictive covenants in Sections 5 and 6, are distinct and severable, notwithstanding that the covenants may be set forth in one section for convenience. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, for any reason, neither the validity of the remaining part of such provision nor the validity of any other provision of this Agreement shall in any way be affected. Should any particular restrictive covenant, provision or clause of this Agreement be held unreasonable or unenforceable for any reason, including without limitation, the time period, geographic area and/or scope of activity covered by such covenant, provision or clause, the parties acknowledge and agree that such covenant, provision or clause shall be given effect and enforce to whatever extent would be reasonable and enforceable under applicable law. The parties expressly authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to modify or revise such provision to limit the covenants to cover the maximum period of time, range of activities or other restrictions as would be enforceable under Indiana law.
9. Available Relief. Employee agrees that a Banking Organization, or its successor or assigns, will suffer irreparable damage and injury and will not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of any breach by Employee of any provision of Sections 4, 5 or 6, herein. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or of a threatened or attempted breach by Employee of Sections 4, 5, or 6, in addition to all other remedies to which a Banking Organization is entitled under law, in equity, or otherwise (including, but not limited to, monetary damages), a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary or permanent injunction (without the necessity of showing any actual damage) or a decree of specific performance and no bond or other security shall be required in that connection.
10. Enforcement/Attorneys’ Fees. In any action that is brought to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party or its assigns and successors, shall be entitled to recover their reasonable attorneys’ and paralegal fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. If a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, institute any action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, Employee hereby waives all claims or defenses that a Banking Organization or its assigns and successors, have an adequate remedy at law, and Employee shall not urge in any such action or proceeding the claim or defense that such a remedy at law exists.

Upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, Company shall immediately notify Verenium.
3. Company agrees to treat Confidential Information received from or on behalf of Verenium, with at least the same degree of care that Company uses to protect its own Confidential Information. Company shall only disseminate Confidential Information to such of its Representatives with a special need to know for carrying out the Purpose of this Agreement. In addition, Company hereby agrees that such Representatives shall be informed of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information received and that such Representatives shall be bound by the terms hereof or subject to confidentiality and non-use obligations no less restrictive than those set forth herein. Company shall be liable for any disclosure or use of the Confidential Information by its Representatives in a manner not authorized by this Agreement. “Representative” means any employee, consultant, contractor, officer, agent, advisor, and/or director of a Party. “Affiliate” for purposes of this Agreement shall mean any one or more business entities which are: (a) owned or controlled by, (b) owning or controlling, or (c) under common control with a Party at the time in question.

5. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced by Company in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information by Company shall remain the property of Verenium unless otherwise authorized in writing by Verenium.

10. This Agreement shall constitute the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be modified only in writing and signed by both Parties; provided, however, that any restrictions set forth on the Company or its Affiliates in any previous confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements between the Parties or their Affiliates shall remain in place for the periods set forth in any such agreements.

Proprietary Information may include, for example and without limitation, the product offering, content partners, product pricing, product availability, computer programs, technical drawings, algorithms, processes, ideas, schematics, trade secrets, processes, formulas, data, know-how, improvements, inventions (whether patentable or not), techniques, marketing plans, forecasts and strategies, and information concerning customers or vendors. Proprietary Information shall also include all information of a like nature owned by any other person and furnished to the Disclosing Party by such other person pursuant to an undertaking by the Disclosing Party to maintain the same in confidence.
2. The Receiving Party agrees (a) to hold the Disclosing Party’s Proprietary Information In strict confidence and to take all reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions that Receiving Party employs with respect to its confidential materials), (b) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person without prior written permission of the Disclosing Party, excluding disclosure to Representatives, (c) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such Proprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into the contemplated business relationship with the Disclosing Party, and (d) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee given access to any such Proprietary Information must have a legitimate “need to know” and be subject to restrictions on disclosure of Proprietary Information practically identical to the terms set forth herein. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall not apply with respect to any information that (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes generally available to the public, or (ii) was or is rightfully in Receiving Party’s possession or the possession of any of its Representatives or was known by it or its Representatives without restriction prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (iii) was or is rightfully disclosed to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives by a third party provided the Receiving Party complies with restrictions imposed by the third party, or (iv) was or is independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party and its Representatives may make disclosures required by court order or any legal or judicial process, without any liability hereunder, provided the Receiving Party uses reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and to obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate In the proceeding to the extent legally permissible and reasonably practicable.
3. Promptly upon receipt of a written request by the Disclosing Party at any time (which will be effective if actually received or three days after mailed first class postage prepaid to the Receiving Party’s address herein), the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party, or, at its sole discretion, destroy and certify to the Receiving party in writing the destruction of all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and all documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof; provided, however, the Company and its Representatives shall not be obligated to return or destroy Proprietary Information to the extent otherwise required by law, regulation, rule or practice governing professionals or any internal compliance policy or procedure required by law, regulation rule of practice governing professionals.

4. Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business relationship contemplated by this Agreement.
5. The parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the possible transaction between the parties, there can be no adequate remedy at law for any material breach of this Agreement, that any such breach may allow the breaching party or third parties to unfairly compete with the non-breaching party, resulting in irreparable harm to the non-breaching party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat thereof, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party In writing immediately upon the occurrence of any unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware.
6. The parties expressly agree that neither the terms or conditions of this Agreement, nor the discussions held by the parties to address the feasibility of a potential business relationship shall be construed as to prevent either party from pursuing similar discussions with third parties in similar markets or obligate either party to take, continue or forgo any action relating to the above-mentioned discussions. Further, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting either party from independently developing, acquiring, and marketing products, services, and other materials, which are similar to or competitive In any geographic area and in any form with the other party’s product(s) or service(s). However, this paragraph shall not be deemed to grant to either party any license under the other party’s copyrights or patents.

To the extent that its Evaluation Material includes human resources data and/or other information that serves to identify one or more individuals (“PII”), the disclosing party agrees to provide only such information as is required for evaluating or planning for a possible Transaction and to provide any notices and obtain any consents necessary for the receiving party to store and access such PII globally and to use PII in connection with the Transaction. The receiving party agrees to notify the disclosing party of any request received by the receiving party for access, correction, amendment or redaction of any PII. The disclosing party shall be responsible for compliance with all such requests. The receiving party also agrees to notify the disclosing party of any actual or suspected improper acquisition of PII of which the receiving party becomes aware.
4. Residuals. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the ability of either party or any of its Representatives to use “residuals” relating to the Evaluation Material of the other party. The term “residuals” shall mean information of any kind included in or relating to the Evaluation Material which is retained in the memories of Representatives of either party who have had access to the Evaluation Material, including ideas, know-how, or techniques contained therein, but not as a result of any deliberate effort to memorize the information. Without limitation of the foregoing, neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its employees or to pay royalties to the other party in connection with any use of residuals.
5. Independent Development. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit or preclude either party from developing, using, marketing, licensing, and/or selling any independently developed software, hardware, technology or other materials similar or related to the Evaluation Material.
6. Required Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that a party or its Representatives receives a request or is required (by law, rule, regulation, deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil demand or other process) to disclose any of the other party’s Evaluation Material or any of the other information referred to in section 2 hereof (irrespective of the reason for any such request or requirement), the party requested or required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent reasonable and practicable, provide the other party with prior written notice of any such request or requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such order, remedy or waiver is not obtained, the party requested or required to make the disclosure may disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material or other information that such party, in the opinion of counsel, is required to disclose.
7. Return of Materials; Termination. Promptly upon written request from the other party, each party shall return or destroy (at the receiving party’s option) all copies of the Evaluation Material (including all documents based thereon) in its or its Representatives’ possession, provided, that the receiving party shall only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to return or destroy any Evaluation Material created pursuant to its or its Representatives’ standard electronic backup and archival procedures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving party and each of its Representatives may each retain one copy of the Evaluation Material to show compliance with this Agreement or to comply with applicable law, rule or regulation (or, in the case of a party’s advisors, professional standards). Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, each party and its Representatives will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality. This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided, however, that sections 4, 5 and 7 through 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
8. Definitive Agreements. Unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding the Transaction has been executed by the parties, no agreement with respect to the Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties and neither party will be under any obligation whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any oral expression except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The term “definitive agreement” does not include a term sheet or any other preliminary written agreement. Each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not provide Evaluation Material under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.
9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement with respect to the Evaluation Material disclosed hereunder and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements concerning such Evaluation Material, whether written or oral. All additions or modifications to this Agreement must be made in writing and must be signed by both parties.
10. Miscellaneous. Each party agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. In case any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts.
11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction. All matters arising out of, or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by the procedural and substantive laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any conflicts of law principles. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally agree (a) that any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be instituted exclusively in any state or federal court in Delaware, (b) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and (c) that venue is proper in such courts in any such action or proceeding.
12. Waiver. No failure or delay by either party or any of its Representatives in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege under this Agreement.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT, dated as of July 22, 2008, is by and between Financial Investments Corporation (“Investor”) and Taylor Capital Group, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cole Taylor Bank, the “Company”).
WHEREAS, Investor has expressed an interest in discussing with the Company a possible financing transaction being considered by the Company (a “Transaction”);
WHEREAS, in connection with such discussions, the Company may disclose Evaluation Material (as defined below) to Investor; and
WHEREAS, the Company would not disclose the Evaluation Material to Investor, nor discuss with the Investor the possibility of a Transaction, unless Investor executed and delivered this Agreement to the Company, and the Company may be irreparably harmed if Investor or any of its Representatives (as defined below) were to take any of the actions prohibited under this Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, Investor and the Company hereby agree as follows:
1. Evaluation Material. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Evaluation Material” shall mean any and all information provided to Investor by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the Transaction whether in writing, orally, visually, electronically or in machine readable form, through demonstration or in any other manner, and shall include, without limitation, any information regarding or relating to the Company’s operations, business opportunities, costs, finances, personnel, marketing and promotion plans, financial statements, financial information and business practices or policies, and any other business information of the Company or the terms or existence of this Agreement, the Company’s consideration of a possible Transaction or any discussions between the parties with respect thereto, transmitted by or on behalf of the Company to Investor in connection with the Transaction, whether prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and whether or not such information is marked “confidential”. The term “Evaluation Material” does not include, and the obligations hereunder do not apply to, information, knowledge or data which (i) was in Investor’s or its Representatives’ (as defined below) possession prior to disclosure by the Company, or (ii) was or becomes available to Investor or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a party other than the Company provided that such party is not known to Investor, after reasonable inquiry, to be under an obligation of confidentiality to the Company with respect to such information, or (iii) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to the public (other than as a result of disclosure by Investor or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement), or (iv) Investor can demonstrate has been independently developed by it or on its behalf without reliance on the Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material transmitted by or on behalf of the Company shall remain the sole property of the Company.
2. Use of Evaluation Material. The Evaluation Material will be used by Investor solely in connection with its evaluation of a possible Transaction, and not for any other purpose whatsoever. The Evaluation Material will be kept confidential by Investor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not be disclosed to any person, except that Investor may disclose the Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its employees, officers, directors, partners, members, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, agents, consultants and advisors (these persons being collectively called “Representatives”) who (a) need to know such information in order for Investor to be
able to evaluate a possible Transaction and (b) have been directed by Investor to treat the Evaluation Material in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Representatives” as applied to Investor shall not include any potential principal, co-investor or source of equity financing that is not a party to this Agreement. Investor shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives. Neither Investor nor any of its Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, (x) market or use (other than as permitted by the Agreement) any Evaluation Material, (y) reproduce or otherwise copy any Evaluation Material except in connection with the Transaction, or (z) disclose, sell, license, offer to sell or license or otherwise transfer or make available any Evaluation Material to any person other than as otherwise permitted by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Investor will use all reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of Evaluation Material, including, without limitation, efforts commensurate with those it employs for the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information. The term “person” as used in this Agreement will be interpreted broadly to include, without limitation, any agency, corporation, individual, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity.
3. Exceptions. If Investor or its Representatives receive a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Evaluation Material, or if Investor or its Representatives are requested or required to disclose any Evaluation Material under law, governmental order, judicial order, regulatory or statutory requirement, discovery request, oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process, Investor shall notify the Company reasonably promptly following Investor or its Representatives first becoming aware of such requested disclosure, so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the Company’s sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Furthermore, if the Company seeks such a protective order or other appropriate remedy in connection with a third-party request or requirement to disclose the Evaluation Material, Investor and its Representatives will not oppose such efforts. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Company waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and Investor or its Representatives are advised by legal counsel that they are legally compelled to make such disclosures, Investor or its Representatives, as the case may be, (i) may without liability hereunder furnish only that portion of the Evaluation Material or other information regarding a possible Transaction that Investor or its Representatives are advised by legal counsel is legally required, (ii) will give the Company notice of the disclosures to be made to the extent legally permissible and (iii) will, if applicable, request that confidential treatment be accorded the Evaluation Material or other information regarding a possible Transaction so disclosed to the extent legally permissible; it being understood and agreed that there can be no such assurance that the tribunal or governmental or similar authority will grant any such request.
4. No Warranty. ALL EVALUATION MATERIAL IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND THE COMPANY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, PERFORMANCE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR ITS MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
5. No Legal Obligation, Representation, or Warranty. The parties agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into between the Company and Investor with respect to the Transaction, neither the Company nor Investor will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Nothing contained in any discussions between Investor and the Company or in any Evaluation Material shall be deemed to constitute a representation or warranty. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement, or understanding, whether oral or written, or any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing, or conduct.
6. Return of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the written request of the Company, Investor will, at its own expense,
(i) reasonably promptly redeliver to the Company or, at the at Investor’s option, destroy all copies (including permanently erasing or deleting any electronic copies) of the Evaluation Material in the possession or control of Investor or any of its Representatives and
(ii) reasonably promptly destroy all analyses, notes, data, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other documents and materials prepared by Investor or any of its Representatives in connection with their evaluation and review of a possible Transaction that contain, reflect or are based upon or generated from, in whole or in part, any of the Evaluation Material. Upon the Company’s written request, Investor will confirm any such destruction to the Company in writing. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Evaluation Material, Investor will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality hereunder respecting Evaluation Material, including without limitation, with respect to oral Evaluation Material and their obligation not to use any Evaluation Material for any purpose other than as specifically permitted in this Agreement.
7. Non-Solicitation. For a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, Investor will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire or offer to enter into any contract with any executive officer of the Company with whom Investor has contact, or of whom Investor otherwise becomes aware, during its discussions with the Company or its evaluation of a possible Transaction; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit Investor from engagement in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to the Company’s employees; and provided, further, that Investor shall not be prohibited from soliciting or hiring any such employee whose employment has been terminated by the Company or its affiliates.
8. Standstill. For a period of eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, and except in connection with the Transaction, Investor will not, directly or indirectly, and Investor will cause any person controlled by Investor not to, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, partnership, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its affiliates, (iii) make, or in any way participate in any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (v) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) advise, assist or encourage any other person in connection with any of the foregoing. Investor also agrees during such period not to (x) request the Company, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence), (y) take any action that would reasonably be expected to require the Company or any of its affiliates to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement or the possibility of a Transaction, or (z) communicate with the Company’s stockholders (other than communications with any of the officers of the Company, and any other employees of the Company designated by such officers, in the manner contemplated by this Agreement) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.
9. Acknowledgement. Investor acknowledges that it is aware, and that it will advise its Representatives who receive the Evaluation Material, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer (and options, warrants and rights relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.
10. Public Disclosure. Each of the Company and Investor acknowledge and agree that it will not, and it will cause its respective employees, representatives, affiliates and agents not to, publicly disclose, confirm or acknowledge the existence, or terms and conditions, of this Agreement, or the fact that the Company may be considering a possible Transaction with Investor, other than in a press release approved by each party hereto or as otherwise specifically agreed in writing by the parties hereto, except to the extent the Company believes in good faith, after consultation with counsel, it is required by any law, rule or listing requirement to make such disclosure, provided that the Company shall not identify the Investor or any of its affiliates by name without the Investor’s consent.
11. No License. Investor acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to Investor or any of its Representatives to any Evaluation Material, or to any copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patent rights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights of the Company.
12. Third-Party Contacts. Neither Investor nor any of its Representatives shall knowingly contact any employee (other than the officers of the Company and other employees designated by such officers in the manner contemplated by this Agreement), supplier or customer of the Company regarding the Transaction or the Company’s prospects, without the Company’s prior written consent.
13. No Commitment. Each of the Company and Investor understands and agrees that no contract or agreement or binding obligation providing for or with respect to any Transaction shall be created or deemed to exist unless and until a definitive agreement has been executed and delivered with respect thereto, and that, unless and until a definitive agreement between the parties has been executed and delivered, no party has any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to enter into or pursue a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression, whether before or after the execution of this Agreement.
14. Equitable Remedies. Investor hereby agrees that a failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement would cause the Company irreparable harm and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy for an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by Investor or any of its Representatives because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered by the Company in the event that this Agreement is breached. Accordingly, the Company will be entitled to specific performance of this Agreement and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach without proof of actual damages. Investor further agrees to waive, and to use its reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. Any such equitable remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Company.
15. Authority. By signing below, each of the undersigned representatives of the parties hereto represents and warrants that he or she has full authority to execute this Agreement on his or her respective party’s behalf and to bind his or her respective party to the terms of the Agreement.
16. No Waiver. No course of action or failure to act by either party will constitute a waiver by a party of any right or remedy under this Agreement, and no waiver by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing.
17. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. However, if any provision of this Agreement is prohibited or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder thereof or any of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
18. Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without reference to its conflicts of law principles. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois, which will be the sole venue for resolution of all disputes related to this Agreement. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.
19. Entire Agreement; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Investor and the Company regarding the matters set forth herein, and no representations or promises have been made that are not fully set forth herein. This Agreement shall be binding solely on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
20. Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall serve as an original, but all of which shall constitute but one agreement. For purposes of executing this Agreement, any signed documents transmitted by facsimile machine with automatic confirmation of receipt shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original document. The signature of any party transmitted by facsimile machine shall be considered to be an original signature and any such document shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as an original document executed, delivered and exchanged between the parties. At the request of any party, any executed document delivered by facsimile machine shall be re-executed by all parties in a “hard-copy” form. The parties hereto hereby agree that none of them shall raise the use of a facsimile machine for the transmission of signatures as a defense to this Agreement and each such party hereby waives such defense.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT
 This Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this ""Agreement""), is made as of September 17, 2001 between EarthLink, Inc. a Delaware corporation (""EarthLink""), and PeoplePC, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""PeoplePC""). EarthLink and PeoplePC are sometimes referred to herein individually as a ""Party"" and collectively as the ""Parties.""
 1. Purpose. EarthLink and PeoplePC wish to have discussions relating to a potential transaction (the ""Transaction"") between EarthLink (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders) and PeoplePC (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders). In the course of such discussions, each Party expects to make available to the other Party and its Representatives (as defined herein) Evaluation Material (as defined herein) concerning the businesses, financial condition, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, and prospects of such Party. As a condition to making such information available, each Party is entering this Agreement and agrees that all Evaluation Material received by it or its Representatives from the other Party or any of its Representatives shall be treated in accordance with this Agreement.
 2. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) the term ""Receiving Party"" means the Party receiving Evaluation Material; (ii) the term ""Furnishing Party"" means the Party providing Evaluation Material or causing Evaluation Material to be provided; (iii) the term ""Representatives"" means the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors engaged in connection with the review and evaluation of the Transaction) of the specified Party; and (iv) the term ""Evaluation Material"" means all proprietary and confidential information concerning the Furnishing Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in verbal, visual, written, electronic or other form, which is made available by the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Primary Evaluation Material""), together, in each case, with all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, studies, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based in whole or in part thereon prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Derivative Evaluation Material""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term ""Evaluation Material"" shall not include, and the Parties' obligations herein (other than their obligations under paragraph 6 of this Agreement) shall not extend to information which (a) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Furnishing Party; (b) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Evaluation Material; (c) is now or hereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party's Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives and such source is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party following reasonable inquiry, under any obligation to the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to keep such information confidential; or (e) is transmitted by or on behalf of the Furnishing Party after receiving written notification from the Receiving Party of the termination of discussions relating to the Transaction or written instructions from the Receiving Party not to furnish any further Evaluation Material.
 3. Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material.
 (a) Confidentiality of Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material (i) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and considering the Transaction; (ii) shall be kept strictly confidential by the Receiving Party; and (iii) shall be provided by the Receiving Party solely to those of its Representatives to whom disclosure is reasonably required to facilitate the Receiving Party's evaluation or consideration of the Transaction, it being the intention of the Parties to restrict the dissemination of Evaluation Material to as small a working group as practicable. The Parties agree that all Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Furnishing Party. Before providing access to Evaluation Material to any Representative, the Receiving Party shall inform such Representative of the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and shall advise such Representative that, by accepting possession of or access to such information, such Representative is agreeing to be bound by this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.
 (b) Compulsory Disclosure of Evaluation Material. If the Receiving Party or its Representatives are requested or required in any judicial, arbitral or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or otherwise), or the Receiving Party is so requested or required to disclose any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under paragraph (3)(e) of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall give the Furnishing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Furnishing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall reasonably cooperate with the Furnishing Party in seeking such an order. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party is nontheless, in the opinion of the Receiving Party's or (in the case of disclosure requested or required of a Representative, such Representative's) outside counsel or General Counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall use all requisite reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material to the extent such assurances are available. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Receiving Party may disclose Evaluation Material under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b) without liability hereunder.
 (c) Other Public Disclosure. Except (i) for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party consistent with advice of counsel, for the disclosing Party not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or order, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the order Party, neither Part shall:
 (x) make any disclosure (and each Party shall direct its Representatives not to make any disclosure) to any person of (A) the fact that discussions, negotiations or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, or the fact that either Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or (C) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any proposed Transaction, including the status of the discussions or negotiations related thereto, or
 (y) make any public statement concerning a proposed Transaction.
 (d) Notice If either Party proposes to make any disclosure in reliance on clause (i) above, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party with the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and shall in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the other Party concerning the nature and scope of the information it proposes to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may make such public announcement or public statement if in the opinion of such Party's outside counsel or General Counsel, such public announcement or public statement is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or of any rule or regulation of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system on which such Party's securities are listed or trade. In such event, the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to give advance notice to the other Party and to consult with the other Party on the timing and content of any such public announcement or public statement.
 (e) Certain Securities Law Restrictions. Each Party acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may contain material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party. Each Party further acknowledges its awareness of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on persons in possession of material nonpublic information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either Party that any Evaluation Material in fact contains material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party.
 (f) Contact with Employees and Representatives. Neither Party shall communicate with any employee of the other Party regarding the Transaction or disclose any Evaluation Material to any employee or Representative of the other Party, other than the employees and Representatives named on the working group lists provided by the Parties from time to time.
 (g) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party will be restricted from using the information contained in the Evaluation Material that is retained in the minds of Representatives who have had access to the other Party's Evaluation Material, unless such use shall infringe on any of such Party's patent rights, trademark rights or copyright rights.
 4. Accuracy of Evaluation Material: No Representations or Warranties. Each Party acknowledges and agrees (a) that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by either Party or any of its respective Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (b) that the Parties shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties (if any) that may be made in a definitive written agreement for the Transaction, signed and delivered by both Parties, and then only to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided therein.
 5. No Solicitation.
 (a) For a period of one year subsequent to the termination of discussions regarding a Transaction, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by the other Party (or any of its subsidiaries) with whom the hiring Party first has contact, or who first becomes known to the hiring Party. In the course of the Parties' discussions and due diligence with respect to the proposed Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either Party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring Party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring Party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring Party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other Party or (iii) is identified by a third party executive search firm or employment agency without any assistance from such Party.
 (b) For a period one year from the date of this Agreement, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party or the other Party's board of directors, either directly or indirectly through any affiliate or Representative or otherwise: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, by purchase, tender offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise, ownership or control of any voting securities, or any direct or indirect right to acquire any voting securities, of the other Party, any subsidiary thereof, or any successor corporation thereto; (ii) make, or in any way participate in any ""solicitation"" of ""proxies"" (as such terms are used in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other Party; (iii) seek or propose to influence or control the management or policies of the other Party; (iv) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of any merger, acquisition or other business combination or extraordinary transaction involving the other Party or any of its subsidiaries or any securities or assets of the other Party or any of its subsidiaries; (v) form, join or in any way participate in a ""group""( as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in connection with any of the foregoing, or (vi) request the other Party or any of the other party's Representatives to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph 5(b) in any manner which may reasonably be expected to compel or result in public disclosure; provided that such limitations shall expire upon the public announcement of a third party tender offer for more than fifty percent of the outstanding voting 3
securities of the other Party or a business combination between the other Party and a third party. Each Party (the ""Representing Party"") represents and warrants to the other Party that as of the date of this Agreement the Representing Party does not directly or indirectly own or possess voting or dispositive control over any voting securities of the other Party.
 6. Return and Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time after termination of discussions by either Party with respect to the Transaction, upon the request of the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly (and in no event later than five business days after such request) (a) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the Furnishing Party all copies of all Primary Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is in a visual or written format and erase or destroy all copies of all such Primary Evaluation Material which is stored in electronic format, and (b) destroy or cause to be destroyed all Derivative Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Nothing herein shall obligate the Receiving Party to provide any Derivative Evaluation Material to the Furnishing Party. Notwithstanding the return, destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material hereunder, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
 7. Remedies. Each Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this Agreement by it or any of its Representatives, and that in addition to all other remedies which either Party may have, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.

 8. Miscellaneous.
 (a) No License. Neither Party grants a license, by implication or otherwise, under any of its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to the Receiving Party. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other Party's Evaluation Material. The Furnishing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently or in the future develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Material. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for its products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Evaluation Material, provided that the Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.
 (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the confidentiality of their discussions, negotiations and investigations concerning a Transaction.
 (c) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Parties.
 (d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement unless the enforcement of such provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.
 (e) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement to consummate a Transaction, to conduct or continue negotiations with respect to a Transaction, or to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, and neither Party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or by virtue of any other written or oral expression by the Parties' respective Representatives unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction is executed and delivered by both Parties, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Both Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not to provide Evaluation Material to the Receiving Party under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. If either Party determines not to proceed with negotiations with respect to a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of such determination.
 (f) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws thereof.

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
This Confidentiality Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into as of October 17, 2016 by and between Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, a Canadian corporation (“Fairfax”), and Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, AG, a Swiss company (“Allied World”).
WHEREAS, in order to evaluate a possible business combination or similar transaction (the “Possible Transaction”) between Fairfax (or one of its affiliates) and Allied World, each of Fairfax and Allied World may disclose and deliver to the other party (such first party, when disclosing such information, being the “Disclosing Party” and such other party, when receiving such information, being the “Receiving Party”) certain information about the Disclosing Party and/or its subsidiaries for the sole purpose of enabling the Receiving Party to evaluate, negotiate and consummate the Possible Transaction; and
WHEREAS, as a condition to pursuing these discussions and exchanging information, the parties wish to enter into this Agreement to restrict the use and disclosure of such discussions and information and to provide for certain other matters;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Fairfax and Allied World mutually agree as follows:
1. Non-Disclosure Agreement.
(a) All information that is furnished directly or indirectly by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives (as defined below), whether or not marked as confidential and whether furnished before or after the date hereof, whether in oral, written or electronic form, together with any notes, reports, summaries, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other materials prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that contain, references to or are based upon, in whole or in part, any information so furnished to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives pursuant hereto (such notes, reports, summaries, analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other materials are referred to herein as “Derivative Materials”), is referred to herein as “Proprietary Information”. Proprietary Information does not include, however, information that (i) was or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, which source the Receiving Party does not know, after reasonable inquiry, to be in violation of any legal duty or obligation owed to the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives with respect to such information, (ii) was or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of a breach by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of this Agreement or a violation by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of any other non-use or confidentiality obligation), (iii) was previously in the possession of the Receiving Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without reference to the
Proprietary Information. The term “Representative” means, as to any person, such person’s affiliates, officers, directors, general partners, members, employees, consultants, investment bankers, financial advisors, accountants, legal counsel, consultants and potential lenders. The term “affiliate” has the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the regulations promulgated under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
(b) Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement or as required by applicable law, regulation, stock exchange rule or by legal, judicial, regulatory or administrative process (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) (“Legally Required”), (a) the Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep all Proprietary Information confidential and not disclose or reveal any Proprietary Information to any person other than its Representatives who are participating in evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction (all of whom shall be informed of the confidential nature of such Proprietary Information) and shall cause its Representatives to treat such Proprietary Information in a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that each party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its respective Representatives, (b) the Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than in connection with evaluating, negotiating, advising or financing with respect to the Possible Transaction or the consummation of the Possible Transaction, and (c) neither party shall, nor cause or permit their respective Representatives to, disclose to any person the existence or terms of this Agreement or that discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning the Possible Transaction, or any term, condition or other matter relating to the Possible Transaction (the information referred to in this clause (c), the “Transaction Information”). For the avoidance of doubt, each of those affiliates and Representatives of a Receiving Party that do not receive or have access to the Proprietary Information of the other party and the Transaction Information shall not be bound by or subject to the terms of this Agreement.
2. Legally Required Disclosure; Return or Destruction of Proprietary Information. In the event the Receiving Party (or any of its Representatives) shall be Legally Required to disclose any Proprietary Information or Transaction Information, the Receiving Party shall, in advance of such disclosure, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with notice of such requirement and a description of the Proprietary Information and Transaction Information that the Receiving Party or its Representative intends to disclose and to reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to the extent it may seek to limit such disclosure, including, if requested, taking all reasonable steps, at the Disclosing Party’s expense, to resist or avoid any such legal, judicial, regulatory or administrative process or to obtain a protective order in respect thereof. Upon either party’s request, each party hereto shall (and shall cause its Representatives, and any other person, to whom it has disclosed any Proprietary Information or Transaction Information) promptly either (at the Receiving Party’s option) return to the other party hereto or destroy (and certify in writing to the other party by an authorized officer supervising such destruction) all copies or other reproductions of Proprietary Information of the other party, other than any Derivative Materials, in its possession or the possession of any of its Representatives, and shall not retain any copies or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of such materials. The Receiving Party shall destroy all Derivative Materials, and such destruction will be certified in writing to the Disclosing Party by an authorized officer supervising such destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain data or electronic records containing Proprietary Information or Derivative Materials for the purposes of complying with its record retention policies or as required by applicable law so long as such data or records are not accessible in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of Proprietary Information required by this Paragraph 2, for the duration of the term of this Agreement, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by all duties and obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof.
3. Standstill. Each party hereby represents to the other party that, as of the date hereof, neither it nor any of its affiliates has beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries (other than securities owned by any benefit plan of such party). Each party further covenants and agrees, in consideration of it being furnished with Proprietary Information, that neither it nor any of its affiliates who have received or had access to the Proprietary Information of the other party (a “Restricted Affiliate”) will, at any time commencing on the date hereof and ending on the earliest of (a) the twelve (12) month anniversary of this Agreement, (b) the execution and delivery by Fairfax (or its affiliate(s)) and Allied World of a definitive agreement to effect the Possible Transaction and (c) a Fundamental Change Event (as defined below) with respect to the other party, directly or indirectly, unless requested in writing (or by email) by the other party’s chief executive officer, chairman or board of directors: (i) acquire (or agree, offer, seek or propose to acquire, in each case, publicly or privately), by purchase, tender offer, exchange offer, agreement or business amalgamation or combination or in any other manner, any ownership, including beneficial ownership, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of any material assets or businesses or any securities of the other party or any of its subsidiaries, or any rights or options to acquire such ownership (including from any third party); (ii) publicly or privately offer to enter into, or publicly or privately propose, any merger, business combination, amalgamation, recapitalization, restructuring or other extraordinary transaction with the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) initiate any stockholder proposal or the convening of a stockholders’ meeting of or involving the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) solicit proxies (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act) or consents to vote with respect to any matter from, or otherwise seek to influence, advise or direct the vote of, holders of any shares of capital stock of the other party or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital stock; (v) otherwise seek or propose to influence, advise, change or control the management, board of directors, governing instruments, affairs or policies of the other party or any of its subsidiaries; (vi) make any public disclosure, or take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public disclosure, with respect to any of the matters set forth in this Agreement or (vii) assist, advise, act in concert or participate with or encourage others to, including as part of a “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, any of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit a party from making a non-public proposal to the other party with respect to any transaction of the type described in clause (ii) of this Paragraph 3, so long as such proposal is not knowingly made by such party in a manner that would require the public disclosure thereof by either party. A “Fundamental Change Event” means a party has after the date of this Agreement entered into a definitive written agreement with a third party providing for (i) any acquisition of a majority of the voting securities of such party by any person or group, (ii) any acquisition of a majority of the consolidated assets of such party and its subsidiaries by any person or group, or (iii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination, amalgamation or any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction (provided that, in the case of any transaction covered by the foregoing clause (iii), immediately following such transaction, any person (or the direct or indirect shareholders of such person) will beneficially own a majority of the outstanding voting power of such party or the surviving parent entity in such transaction).
4. Non-Solicit. In consideration of being furnished the Proprietary Information by the other party, each party agrees that, for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of this Agreement, such party and its Restricted Affiliates shall not employ or solicit to employ any of the current officers or employees of the other party or its subsidiaries with whom such party or its Representatives has had contact in connection with the evaluation of the Possible Transaction or who were specifically identified to such party during the period of investigation of the other party pursuant to this Agreement, without obtaining the prior written consent of the other party. The use of an independent employment agency or employee search firm (so long as it is not directed by such party to solicit employees of the other party or its subsidiaries) or newspaper, trade publication or online job advertising and the hiring as a result thereof of any employee shall not be construed as a breach of this Agreement.
5. Term. This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the earlier of (a) one (1) year from the date hereof and (b) the execution and delivery by Fairfax and Allied World of a definitive agreement to effect the Possible Transaction.
6. Miscellaneous. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of New York and will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be amended or modified only in a written instrument executed by the parties hereto. It is understood and agreed that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. This remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity. The parties hereto agree that unless and until a definitive agreement is executed and delivered with respect to the Possible Transaction, neither party intends to be, nor shall either be, under any legal obligation with respect to the Possible Transaction or otherwise, by virtue of any written or oral expressions by themselves or their respective Representatives with respect to the Possible Transaction, including any obligation to commence or continue discussions or negotiations, except for the matters specifically agreed to in this Agreement. Neither party hereto makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, on which the other party may rely as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information and only those representations and warranties made in writing in a definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction, if any, shall have any legal effect. The parties hereto also agree that, other than as may be set forth in a definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction, neither party hereto shall have any liability whatsoever to the other party, including in contract, tort or under federal or state securities laws, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from, any errors or omissions in the Proprietary Information. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts which may be delivered by way of PDF or similar electronic facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

The term Evaluation Material does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Recipient or any of its Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (ii) was within a Recipient’s or its Representatives’ (on behalf of Recipient) possession, prior to its being furnished to Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of Provider or (iii) is or becomes available to Recipient or its Representatives (on behalf of Recipient) from a source other than the Provider or its Representatives, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, Provider with respect to such information or (iv) Recipient can reasonably show was independently developed by Recipient or Recipient’s Representatives without the use of or reference to any Evaluation Material provided by or on behalf of Provider or its Representatives.

For the avoidance of doubt, Roark Capital Acquisition LLC shall be a Representative of FOCUS Brands Inc. under this Agreement.
(e) The term “Person” includes the media and any corporation, partnership, group, individual or other entity.
3. Use of Evaluation Material. Each Recipient shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction and (ii) keep the Evaluation Material confidential, and, subject to Section 5, will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, disclose any of the Evaluation Material in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that any of such information may be disclosed to Recipient’s Representatives who need to know such information for the sole purpose of helping Recipient evaluate a Possible Transaction. Each Recipient agrees to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of such Recipient’s Representatives.
This Agreement does not grant Recipient or any of its Representatives any license to use Provider’s Evaluation Material except as provided herein. In addition, all proprietary and intellectual property rights in and to the Evaluation Material shall remain the sole property of Provider, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed in any way to grant to Recipient or its Representatives or any other Person any express or implied option, license or other right, title or interest in or to any Evaluation Material, or to any intellectual property rights embodied in such Evaluation Material.

5. Legally Required Disclosure. If a Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, other requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 above, such Recipient shall provide Provider with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement together with copies of the material proposed to be disclosed so that Provider may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Provider, a Recipient or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled or required to disclose Evaluation Material or any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under Section 4 or would be liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such Recipient or its respective Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such requiring Person only that portion of such Evaluation Material or any such facts which Recipient or its Representatives is legally compelled or required to disclose, provided that Recipient and/or its Representatives cooperate with Provider to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Material or such facts by the Person receiving the material. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Recipient nor Recipient’s Representatives shall be required to provide notice or seek consent to disclose any information in connection with a routine audit by, or blanket request from, a regulatory or governmental entity with jurisdiction over Recipient or Recipient’s Representatives, and not directed at the Company or the Possible Transaction; provided that the Recipient or its Representatives, as applicable, inform any such authority of the confidential nature of the information disclosed to them and to keep such information confidential in accordance with such authority’s policies or procedures.
6. “Click Through” Agreements. The terms of this Agreement shall control over any additional purported confidentiality requirements imposed by an offering memorandum or electronic database, dataroom, or similar repository of Evaluation Material to which Recipient or its Representatives are granted access in connection with this Agreement or a Possible Transaction, notwithstanding acceptance of such an offering memorandum or submission of an electronic signature, “clicking” on an “I Agree” icon or other indication of assent to such additional confidentiality conditions, it being understood and agreed that Recipient’s and its Representatives’ confidentiality obligations with respect to the Evaluation Material are exclusively governed by this Agreement and may not be reduced or enlarged except by an agreement executed by the Parties hereto in traditional written format.
7. Return or Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time upon the request of a Provider for any reason, a Recipient will, and will direct its Representatives to, promptly, but not later than 10 business days, after receipt of such notice or request, destroy or return (at Recipient’s option) all Evaluation Material and all documents that incorporate Evaluation Material, and no copy or extract thereof (including electronic copies) shall be retained, except that Recipient and its Representatives may retain one copy to be kept confidential and used solely for archival, legal, and compliance purposes. Recipient shall provide to the Provider written confirmation of destruction signed by an authorized representative of Recipient. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Material, Recipient and its Representatives will continue to be bound by such Recipient’s obligations hereunder with respect to such Evaluation Material.
8. No Solicitation. Recipient will not, within eighteen months from the date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly solicit the employment or consulting services of or employ or engage as a consultant any of the senior or key employees of the Provider or any of its subsidiaries nor any other employee of the Provider or any if its subsidiaries with whom Recipient has had direct contact in connection with its evaluation of a Possible Transaction or of whom it has become aware as a result of its receipt of any Evaluation Material, so long as they are employed by the Provider or any of its subsidiaries and for two months thereafter. For the purposes of clarification, the mere receipt of Provider’s employee list by Recipient shall not be considered a solicitation of or a direct contact with such employees pursuant to this section. A Recipient is not prohibited from: (i) soliciting by means of a general advertisement not directed at any particular individual or the employees of the Provider or its subsidiaries generally or (ii) engaging any recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit individuals for employment on behalf of such Recipient (and soliciting any person identified by any such recruiting firm or organization) so long as such Recipient does not identify either Provider or any of the individuals employed by Provider to be solicited by such recruiting firm or organization. The provisions of this Section 8 shall terminate and be of no further effect upon the acquisition of such Provider by a third party.
9. Standstill. Participant does not own any of the capital stock of the Company as of the Effective Date. Participant agrees that, for a period of one year after the date of this Agreement (the “Standstill Period”), unless specifically invited in writing by the Company, neither it nor (1) any of its majority-owned subsidiaries, (2) its Representatives (acting on its behalf), or (3) Roark Capital Acquisition LLC or its affiliates who receive Evaluation Material directly from Roark Capital Acquisition LLC or Participant or at their direction, will in any manner, directly or indirectly:
(a) effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in, or in any way assist any other Person to effect, seek, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in:
(i) any acquisition of any securities (or any acquisition of Beneficial Ownership thereof) or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(ii) any tender or exchange offer, merger or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(iii) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
(iv) any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) or consents to vote any voting securities of the Company;
(b) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined under the Act) with respect to the securities of the Company;
(c) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit an unsolicited proposal for or offer of (with or without condition), any extraordinary transaction involving the Company or its securities or assets;
(d) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company;
(e) take any action which may reasonably be expected to force the Company to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in (a) above; or
(f) enter into any discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.
Participant also agrees, and will cause its Representatives to agree, during the Standstill Period, not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this Section 9 (including this sentence).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9 to the contrary, if, at any time during the Standstill Period, a public announcement is made by the Company or any other Person (other than Participant or its Representatives) that a third party (other than Participant or its Representatives) intends to acquire at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, voting control or a material part of the Company’s assets (by way of a tender offer, exchange offer, proxy contest, acquisition or other similar transaction), or if a definitive agreement is executed by the Company with a third party relating to such an acquisition of capital stock or assets, the restrictions set forth in this Section 9 shall immediately terminate and cease to be of any further effect on Participant.
Participant further agrees, and will cause its Representatives to agree, that unless otherwise directed by the Company in writing (i) all communications with the Company regarding a Possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, facility tours, or management meetings, and (iii) discussions or questions regarding procedures with respect to a Possible Transaction, will be submitted or directed by Participant or its Representatives only to David Pace, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, or a person or persons designated in writing by David Pace. Further, except upon the Company’s prior written consent, neither Participant nor its Representatives acting on behalf of Participant involved with a Possible Transaction or who have received Evaluation Material will, directly or indirectly, contact any stockholder, director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, or any customer or supplier of the Company, regarding the Evaluation Material or a Possible Transaction. Nothing contained herein shall prevent Participant or its Representatives from maintaining any contacts in the ordinary course of business unrelated to a Possible Transaction or from conducting consumer surveys or other due diligence, in each case, without disclosing or relying on any Evaluation Material.
10. Maintaining Privileges. If any Evaluation Material includes materials or information subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each Party understands and agrees that the Parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual understanding of the Parties that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Evaluation Material that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine.
11. Compliance with Securities Laws. Each Recipient acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may include material nonpublic information (within the meaning of the securities laws of the United States) with respect to Provider. Each Recipient agrees not to use and will cause its Representatives to agree not to use any Evaluation Material of Provider in violation of applicable securities laws.
12. Not a Transaction Agreement. Each Party understands and agrees that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction exists between the Parties unless and until a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, and each Party hereby waives, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) relating to the existence of a Possible Transaction unless and until both Parties shall have entered into a final definitive agreement for a Possible Transaction. Each Party also agrees that, unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Neither Party is under any obligation to accept any proposal regarding a Possible Transaction and either Party may terminate discussions and negotiations with the other Party at any time.
13. No Representations or Warranties; No Obligation to Disclose. Each Recipient understands and acknowledges that neither Provider nor its Representatives makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material furnished by or on behalf of Provider and shall have no liability to Recipient, its Representatives or any other Person relating to or resulting from the use of the Evaluation Material furnished to a Recipient or its respective Representatives or any errors therein or omissions therefrom. As to the information delivered to Recipient, Provider will only be liable for those representations or warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding a Possible Transaction, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating Provider to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any Person.
14. Modifications and Waiver. No provision of this Agreement can be waived or amended in favor of either Party except by written consent of the other Party, which consent shall specifically refer to such provision and explicitly make such waiver or amendment. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.
15. Remedies. Each Party understands and agrees that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by either Party or any of its Representatives and that the Party against which such breach is committed shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threat thereof. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach by either Party of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Party against which such breach is committed.
16. Legal Fees. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either Party or its Representatives has breached this Agreement, then the Party which is, or the Party whose Representatives are, determined to have so breached shall be liable and pay to the other Party the reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the other Party in connection with such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.
17. Governing Law. This Agreement is for the benefit of each Party and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state.
18. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants or restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and if a covenant or provision is determined to be unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration, scope or otherwise, then the Parties intend and hereby request that the court or other authority making that determination shall only modify such extent, duration, scope or other provision to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and enforce them in their modified form for all purposes of this Agreement.
19. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring either Party by virtue of the authorship at any of the provisions of this Agreement.
20. Term. This Agreement, and all obligations and other provisions hereunder, shall terminate two years after the date of this Agreement.
21. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, arrangements and discussions between the Parties regarding such subject matter.
22. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be deemed to constitute a single instrument.
23. Consent to Representation. This agreement also constitutes notice to Participant that the Company has engaged DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms as its legal counsel in connection with the Possible Transaction, and Participant hereby (i) consents to the continued representation of the Company by DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms in relation to the Possible Transaction notwithstanding the fact that DLA Piper LLP (US) may have represented, and may currently or in the future represent, Participant and/or any of its respective affiliates with respect to unrelated matters and (ii) waive any actual or alleged conflict and actual or alleged violation of ethical or comparable rules applicable to DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms that may arise from its representation of the Company in connection with the Possible Transaction, including but not limited to representing the Company against Participant and/or its affiliates in litigation, arbitration, or mediation in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any dispute (including litigation, arbitration, or mediation) between the Parties related to this Agreement, DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms will not represent either Party. In addition, Participant hereby acknowledges that the consent and waiver under this paragraph is voluntary and informed, and that Participant has obtained independent legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver. Participant further agrees that they are each aware of the extent of their respective relationships, if any, with DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliate firms, and do not require additional information from DLA Piper LLP (US) in order to understand the nature of this consent. Each of DLA Piper LLP (US) and its affiliated firms are an express third party beneficiary of this paragraph.

As used herein. “Representatives” shall mean (i) employees of Receiving Party; (ii) attorneys, accountants, or other professional business advisors and, additionally,
(iii) employees of the Receiving Party and those entities directly or indirectly owned by the Receiving Party, in each case, who shall be informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.
4. The above restrictions on the use or disclosure of the Confidential Information shall not apply to any Confidential Information that: (a) is independently developed by Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, or is lawfully received free of restriction from a third party having the right to furnish such Confidential Information; (b) has become generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party; (c) at the time of disclosure to Receiving Party was known to such party free of restriction; or (d) Disclosing Party agrees in writing is free of such restrictions.
5. Neither party is required to disclose any particular information to the other and any disclosure is entirely voluntary and is not intended to be construed as: (a) granting rights by license or otherwise under any trademark, patent, copyright or other intellectual property right; (b) creating a commitment as to any product, including the development or functionality of any product; (c) soliciting any business or incurring any obligation not specified herein; or (d) prohibiting either party from associating themselves with competitors of the other party for purposes substantially similar to those involved herein.
6. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict either party’s right to develop, make, use, market, license or distribute products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information as long as it shall not thereby breach this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed products or services similar to or competitive with those of the other party disclosed in the Confidential Information. Further, either party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals (defined below) resulting from access to or work with Confidential Information disclosed hereunder. The term “residuals” means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory by persons who have had access to the Confidential Information so long as such persons have not studied the information for the purpose of replicating the same from memory. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. The party using any information that it claims to be residuals will have the burden of proving that the information constitutes residuals.
7. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Disclosing Party or the Evaluation, unless prohibited by law, the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Disclosing Party (i) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy; (ii) to consult with the Receiving Party with respect to the Disclosing Party’s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process; or (iii) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained in a timely manner, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, the Receiving Party or its Representative shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and to require that all Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment.
8. To the extent that any Confidential Information may Include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information provided by a party that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.
9. Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall (at the Receiving Party’s election) promptly return or destroy (provided that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of the Receiving Party) all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or an intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in the Receiving Party’s possession or in the possession of any Representative of the Receiving Party; provided, however: (i) that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Confidential Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered; (ii) that the Receiving Party shall not, in connection with the foregoing obligations, be required to identify or delete Confidential Information held electronically in archive or back-up systems in accordance with general systems archiving or backup policies; and (iii) that the Receiving Party shall not be obligated to return or destroy Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is required to retain a copy pursuant to applicable law, and further provided that the Receiving Party will not, and the Receiving Party will use reasonable measures to cause its employees not to, access such Confidential Information so archived or backed-up.
10. Each Party hereto acknowledges that neither it nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Confidential Information.
11. Until a separate definitive agreement regarding a potential relationship or transaction has been executed by the parties, neither party shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to any proposal, term sheet, letter of intent, or draft agreement relating to any such potential relationship or transaction (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (a) may conduct the process that may or may not result in definitive agreement in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party); and (b) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties’ consideration of the potential relationship or transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party and requesting that the other party return or destroy the Confidential Information as described above). Either party can end the discussions at any time, for any reason, and without liability to the other. Any business decision either party makes in anticipation of definitive agreements is at the sore risk of the party making the decision, even if the other party is aware of or has indicated approval of, such decision.
12. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information.
13. In consideration of the Information being furnished to SAP and the Company, each of SAP and the Company hereby agree that, until twelve (12) months after the date of termination of this Agreement, such party will not solicit for employment with such party or any of its subsidiaries, or employ, any of the current officers or employees of the other party with whom such party has had contact during the term of this Agreement and who became known by such party or who was identified to such party as part of the Evaluation under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict or preclude either party from (A) making generalized searches for employees (by use of advertisements in the media, the engagement of search firms or otherwise), (B) continuing its ordinary course hiring practices that are not targeted specifically at employees of the other party or (C) hiring an employee of the other party who first initiates an employment discussion with such party, so long as such party has not violated the restrictions on solicitation contained in this Agreement.
14. In consideration of the Confidential Information being provided to a Receiving Party for purposes of the Evaluation, the parties agree that until one (1) year after the date of termination of this Agreement, neither party nor any of each party’s affiliates or its Representatives acting on the party’s behalf will, unless specifically invited in writing by the other party’s Board of Directors or its duly authorized representative: (i) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any voting securities or direct or indirect rights to acquire any voting securities, or indebtedness of the other party or any subsidiary thereof, or any successor entity; (ii) make, directly or indirectly, any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “34 Act”)) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the other party; (iii) make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer of any merger, consolidation, stock purchase tender or exchange offer, restructuring or business combination, involving the other party or to purchase, directly or indirectly, a material portion of the assets of the other party or its subsidiaries; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act) in connection with any of the foregoing; (v) request the other party or any of the other party’s Representatives to amend or waive any provisions of this paragraph in a manner that would require public disclosure of such request; or (vi) take any action that could reasonably be expected to require the other party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of any of the events described in sub-clauses (i) through (v). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, (1) each party shall be permitted at any time and from time to time to submit to the Chief Executive Officer of the other party one or more offers, proposals or indications of interest related to a transaction between the parties, provided that each such submission is made on a confidential basis and states that the provider does not intend to make a public announcement related to such submission or its text or contents and that the provider of such submission believes, after discussion with its counsel, that the receipt thereof by the other party does not require public disclosure of such submission and (2) no party shall be bound by the foregoing restrictions in the event that any person or “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the 34 Act) other than such party or its affiliates shall (x) acquire or publicly propose to acquire, by purchase, merger, tender offer, reorganization, consolidation or otherwise, beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the other party or assets of the other party or its subsidiaries representing more than 50% of the consolidated earning power of the other party and its subsidiaries and the other party’s Board of Directors has recommended to such other party’s shareholders that such acquisition be approved or (y) enter into an agreement or publicly propose to enter into an agreement providing for the merger or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the other party in which, following consummation of such transaction, substantially all of the persons or entities who, immediately prior to such transaction, had beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting power of the other party would not continue to beneficially own by virtue of their exchange or retention of securities of such other party representing at least 50% of the voting power of the combined entity and would not have the ability to elect a majority of the directors of the combined entity and the other party’s Board of Directors has recommended to such other party’s shareholders that such merger, consolidation or similar transaction be approved.
15. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either party hereto, each party hereto shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction or otherwise if the other party or any of its Representatives breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement.

17. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without giving effect to its principles or rules regarding conflicts of laws, other than such principles directing application of New York law. The parties agree the courts of the State of California shall be the exclusive venue for disputes arising under this Agreement. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect.
18. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties hereto as to Confidential Information disclosed hereunder in connection with the Evaluation and merges all prior discussions between them relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the parties have entered into, or enter into in the future, other agreements which contain terms concerning ownership or use of work product of either party or software license provisions and rights, then this Agreement shall not supersede either party’s rights and obligations as provided in such other agreements, unless such other agreement specifically provides otherwise. Neither Party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of each of the parties by their respective duly authorized officers or representatives. Any waiver of a provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a subsequent waiver of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. It is further understood and agreed that no failure or delay by either party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
19. The term of this Agreement shall be one (1) year beginning with the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier by either party at such party’s sole discretion upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. The provisions herein concerning the disclosure, protection and use of Confidential Information, including Sections 3, 4, 7 and 9, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The non-solicit and standstill obligations shall remain in effect as provided in Sections 13 or 14, as applicable.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts or by facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement."
"EXECUTION VERSION
NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made effective as of February 18, 2013, by and between Central European Distribution Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“CEDC”) and W&L Enterprises Ltd. (the “Recipient”).
 WHEREAS, CEDC has issued (i) 3.00% Convertible Notes due 2013 (the “Convertible Notes”) and (ii) $380 million 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 and €430 ($556.6 million) 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2016 (collectively, the “2016 Notes” and together with the Convertible Notes, the “Notes”).
 WHEREAS, the Recipient holds 7,517,549 shares of CEDC’s outstanding common stock (the “Common Stock”).
 WHEREAS the Recipient and CEDC wish to enter into discussions with respect to a potential restructuring of the Notes and Common Stock (a “Restructuring”).
WHEREAS, CEDC, in such discussions, may disclose certain confidential information to the Recipient in order to initiate, facilitate, and/or progress such restructuring discussions (the “Purpose”).
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration for receiving certain confidential information and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Scope of Confidential Information.
1.1 Subject to Section 1.2 below, “Confidential Information” means confidential, secret, proprietary or other non-public information pertaining to the business, operations, brands, marketing plans, financial matters, legal matters, products, projects, business plans or practices, research and development, product development, intellectual property, financial models, trademarks, trade secrets, accounting and financing data, and methods of production, distribution or procurement, suppliers, distributors, consultants, advisors or employees, directors or officers of CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries (defined below) (together, the “CEDC Group”) that is disclosed or otherwise made available, either orally or in writing, by any member of the CEDC Group to the Recipient or its affiliates, agents, or advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, attorneys, banks and other sources of equity and debt financing and accountants) (collectively, “Representatives”).
1.2 Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include any information that (a) is or becomes publicly available (other than through a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient), (b) is in the possession of or known to the Recipient or its Representatives prior to such information having been furnished to Recipient hereunder, (c) is independently conceived, developed or discovered by the Recipient or on its behalf, (d) is made available to the Recipient or its Representatives by any person other than a member of the CEDC Group without any known breach of any obligation of confidentiality of such other person, or (e) is the subject of a written confirmation from CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries or any member of the CEDC Group stating that any such information is not Confidential Information. In clarification of the foregoing, a general disclosure in the public domain will not cause more specific (but related) information to be excluded as Confidential Information under one of the above exceptions.
1.3 “Subsidiary” of any entity means any other entity in which such first entity owns or Controls, directly or indirectly, an amount of the voting securities, other voting interests or voting partnership interests sufficient to elect at least a majority of such other entity’s board of directors or other governing body (or, if there are no such voting interests, 50% or more of the equity interests of such other entity). For purposes of this Section 1.3, “Control” means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of an individual, corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
2. Use and Disclosure of Confidential Information.
2.1 The Recipient agrees that all Confidential Information will be held and maintained by it in the strictest confidence, will be used by it solely and exclusively for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating and implementing a Restructuring, and will not, directly or indirectly, be used or disclosed by it for any other purpose whatsoever. CEDC acknowledges that Recipient is engaged in businesses similar to those conducted by CEDC and the CEDC Group or other industries in the ordinary course of Recipient’s business. The Recipient will use reasonable care to maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information, provided that such care shall be at least as great as the precautions taken by the Recipient to protect its own confidential information of similar nature.
2.2 The Recipient agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of CEDC, directly or indirectly, disclose all or any portion of the Confidential Information, or the substance thereof, to any third party other than its Representatives in connection with the Purpose, except, subject to Section 2.3 below, to the extent required by applicable law or legal process.
2.3 The Recipient agrees that if the Recipient is required by any law, court or governmental order to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient will provide CEDC, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, with prompt written notice of such requirement so that CEDC or the applicable member of the CEDC Group may seek an appropriate protective order with respect thereto. If such an order is not obtained, only that portion of the Confidential Information shall be furnished that is legally required to be furnished, at the sole expense of CEDC or one of its Subsidiaries, and the Recipient shall exercise commercial efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to CEDC shall not be required where disclosure is made (i) in response to a request by a regulatory or self-regulatory authority, or (ii) in connection with a routine audit or examination by a bank examiner or auditor, and such request, audit or examination does not reference CEDC or this Agreement.
2.4 The Recipient shall ensure that each of its Representatives who are either provided with Confidential Information, or otherwise have access to such Confidential Information, are informed of its confidential nature and are directed to abide by the terms of this Agreement applicable to Representatives or appropriate duties or obligations of confidentiality imposing confidentiality obligations on such Representatives (except that there shall be no requirement to so inform where the Representative to whom the information is to be disclosed is subject to professional obligations to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information or is otherwise bound by requirements of confidentiality in relation to the Confidential Information). The Recipient agrees to be liable for any breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its affiliates or Representatives. The Recipient shall use reasonable efforts to provide written notice to CEDC of any use or disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of this Agreement of which Recipient is aware, including without limitation written details regarding the circumstances and the identity of the individuals or entities who as a result received or may have received access to such Confidential Information.
3. Certain Rights and Limitations.
3.1 The parties hereto are independent of one another and this Agreement does not create any agency, partnership or similar relationship between the parties hereto. CEDC acknowledges that neither the Recipient nor any of its affiliates, nor its or their Representatives, will be deemed to have made any representation or warranty or commitment with respect to the Purpose except as may be set forth in one or more final, legally binding definitive agreements. Except as otherwise provided by CEDC, the Recipient (i) acknowledges that neither CEDC nor any of its Representatives make any representation or warranty hereunder, either express or implied, as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information, provided, however, that CEDC, the CEDC Group and any of their Representatives shall use good faith efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information furnished to Recipient hereunder is true, accurate and complete to the best of their knowledge, and (ii) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law that in the absence of fraud or willful misconduct on their part neither CEDC nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives on any basis (including, without limitation, in contract, tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) as a result of the review by the Recipient or its Representatives or the use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or its Representatives in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
3.2 The Recipient agrees that, upon written request by CEDC, all Confidential Information (and all copies, summaries and notes of the contents or parts thereof) and all Company property received by the Recipient shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, be either returned to CEDC or, to the extent technically practicable, destroyed (at the Recipient’s or its Representatives’ option), except that Recipient and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information as is required to comply with applicable law or regulation or professional standards or internal compliance requirements. The Recipient’s obligations under Section 2 hereof shall survive the return of such tangible embodiments of Confidential Information until termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Recipient nor any of its Representatives shall be required to delete electronically stored Confidential Information to the extent such deletion would be technologically impracticable or inconsistent with the archival records retention policy of the Recipient or its Representatives.
3.3 The Recipient shall not remove, obscure, overprint, deface or destroy any notice of confidentiality, copyright, trademark, logo, legend or other notices of ownership or confidentiality from any originals or copies of Confidential Information the Recipient obtains from the CEDC Group.
3.4 CEDC understands and acknowledges that the Recipient and an affiliate of the Recipient are currently reporting persons with respect to CEDC’s common stock on a Schedule 13D under the provisions of §§ 240.13d-1(a) and 13d-2(a) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, among others, and that accordingly the Recipient and its affiliate will have ongoing disclosure obligations thereunder, which shall not be restricted or limited by this Agreement, including that this Agreement shall be disclosed and publicly filed as an amendment to such Schedule 13D.
4. Remedies. The Recipient acknowledges that a breach of any of the terms of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to CEDC for which CEDC may not be adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that, in addition to all other remedies available to CEDC, including any member of the CEDC Group, in an action at law, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Recipient of the terms of this Agreement, CEDC shall, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security, be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief, including, but not limited to, specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. Each party's rights and obligations under this Agreement are cumulative and are in addition to and not in limitation of such party's rights and obligations under law, equity or any other written agreement.
5. Miscellaneous.
5.1 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and take effect as an enforceable contract in accordance with the laws of the State of New York governing such agreements, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles thereof that would require applicability of any other law. The parties hereto agree that any dispute between them relating to this Agreement will be resolved solely in the manner set forth in clause (i) below:
(i) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the State of New York and in the Borough of Manhattan, and all appellate courts relating thereto, for the purpose of any suit, action, proceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Agreement. Service of process in connection with any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on each party hereto anywhere in the world by the same methods as are specified for the giving of notices under this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such courts and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND REPRESENTS THAT COUNSEL HAS BEEN CONSULTED SPECIFICALLY AS TO THIS WAIVER.
5.2 Any notices or other correspondence (hereinafter collectively referred to as “correspondence”) required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by postage prepaid first class mail, courier or facsimile or delivered by hand to the party to whom such correspondence is required or permitted to be given hereunder, and shall be deemed sufficient upon receipt when delivered personally or by courier, overnight delivery service or confirmed facsimile, or three (3) Business Days after being deposited in the regular mail as certified or registered mail (airmail if sent internationally) with postage prepaid, if such notice is addressed to the party to be notified at such party’s address or facsimile number as set forth below:

5.3 This Agreement contains the complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings whether written or oral, express or implied. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, including without limitation the heirs, executors and legal representatives of each such party. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that all members of the CEDC Group are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Except where expressly indicated otherwise, the words “written” or “in writing” shall include, but not be limited to, written or printed documents, electronic and facsimile transmissions and computer disks or tapes (whether machine or user readable). If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Upon such determination of invalidity or unenforceability, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. No amendment, modification or alteration of the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing and executed by both parties hereto. A failure or delay in exercising any right in respect to this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right. Any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose given. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original for all purposes.
6. Securities Laws. The Recipient acknowledges that it is aware (and, if applicable, that its Representatives who are apprised of this matter have been advised) that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of such company, or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities. The Recipient agrees that, to the extent that it has actually received Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement that constitutes material non-public information, it will not trade any securities of CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the termination of this Agreement and that it will not use any Confidential Information in contravention of the United States securities laws.
7. Termination.
7.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect at all times until the earliest to occur of (i) the filing of an exchange offer, offering memorandum or disclosure statement with respect to the 2016 Notes or Convertible Notes, provided that, to the extent CEDC and the Recipient continue discussions on the terms of a Restructuring following such filing, this period shall extend until the filing of an amended exchange offer, offering memorandum or disclosure statement reflecting such discussions or (ii) 9:00 a.m. (GMT) on March 5, 2013, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect (the “Termination Date”), other than with respect to the rights and obligations of CEDC and Recipient per Section 7.2 hereof.
7.2 On the Termination Date, CEDC shall publicly file a document (the “Cleansing Document”) containing all of the written and oral Confidential Information that constitutes material non-public information and that was provided by CEDC or its advisors to any of (a) the Recipient or its Representatives or (b) any holder of securities who is subject to a confidentiality agreement substantially similar to this Agreement (or to such holder’s Representatives) that was subsequently shared with the Recipient or its Representatives; provided that such Confidential Information shall not include any information only disclosed to the Recipients' advisors and specifically designated as ‘Non-Cleansing Information’ by CEDC at the time of such disclosure (such Confidential Information other than the ‘Non-Cleansing Information’ being the “Disclosure Information”). As promptly as practicable, CEDC will provide the Recipient with a draft of the Cleansing Document. The Cleansing Document shall be the offering memorandum and/or disclosure statement and/or Form 8-K or any periodic report required or permitted to be filed under the Exchange Act with the Securities Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or, if the SEC’s EDGAR filing system is not available, in such other manner that CEDC reasonably determines results in public dissemination of such information. If CEDC does not file the Cleansing Document on the Termination Date as required in accordance with this Section 7.2, then Recipient and/or its Representatives shall be entitled to disclose the Confidential Information that was provided by CEDC or any of its Subsidiaries hereunder without liability to the extent that Recipient or its Representatives reasonably believes that the information constitutes material non-public information that is required to allow it to freely trade, through the issuance of a press release or similar form of public communication, without any liability or breach under this Agreement (such an announcement, the “Recipient’s Cleansing Announcement”). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Cleansing Document filed by CEDC pursuant hereto is not in sufficient detail to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of each of the Recipients or their Representatives, the Recipients and their Representatives will be cleansed of any Confidential Information hereunder such that, following the filing of the Cleansing Document by CEDC, no Recipient shall be restricted, prevented or prohibited from trading any securities under applicable insider dealing or market abuse laws or regulations in any jurisdiction or pursuant to any other applicable laws or regulations, then the Recipients may make a Recipient’s Cleansing Announcement in the manner set forth above in this Section 7.2.

The contractor and any subcontractor(s) shall presume that the VA computer systems and storage media that the contractor or subcontractor access have sensitive information and applications, the modification or disclosure of which could cause significant harm or embarrassment to VA beneficiaries and employees and to VA's ability to perform its mission. If the security requirements for accessing, handling, and storing VA data and systems are specified in the contract, the contractor will comply with the contractual security requirements. If the contract does not contain the requirements, the contractor will handle the VA property with the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized access, use, dissemination, publication, or destruction that the contractor uses to protect its own sensitive information and systems.
b. Any VA information, software, applications, computer systems, and hardware accessed by the contractor in the performance of the contract remain the sole property of VA.
c. To the extent that any software or applications on the VA systems are protected by copyright, the contractor agrees that it will not copy or disclose them without first obtaining VA's prior written authorization, which will be provided only where authorized under applicable copyright law.
d. The contractor, the contractor's employees, and any subcontractor and subcontractor's employees will access the VA information, software, applications, computer systems, and hardware which VA provides, or provides access to, only to the extent necessary, and only for the purpose of performing the contract. The contractor will take reasonable steps to ensure that it will allow only those contractor and subcontractor employees who need to see the VA materials in order to perform the contract to do so. However, this agreement also applies to any other VA systems or data to which the contractor may have access to or be disclosed to the contractor.
e. The contractor will not authorize anyone else to access, disclose, modify, or destroy the information, software or applications on the VA systems provided or accessed under this contract without VA's prior written authorization.
f. The contractor and its employees shall not make any copies of any VA information, including software or applications that are not copyrighted, except as necessary to restore VA computer systems or data storage devices to an operating state. Any copies made by the contractor or subcontractor shall be identified as VA property and handled as sensitive information under this non-disclosure agreement.
g. Any information that the contractor and its employees learns about VA data and VA computer systems shall not be recorded except to the extent necessary to perform the contract, and such information, whether recorded or not, shall be handled as sensitive information under this agreement. The contractor may not use or disclose it except as the contractor is permitted to use or disclose VA sensitive information under the contract and this nondisclosure agreement.
h. The contractor may disclose VA sensitive information to persons other than in the performance of this contract as authorized by the contract and this agreement in only two situations: (1) pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (2) with VA's prior written authorization. Prior to any disclosure pursuant to a court order, the contractor shall promptly notify VA of the court order and provide VA with a copy by fax or e-mail, whichever is faster, and notify by telephone the VA individual designated in advance to receive such notices. If the contractor cannot notify VA before being compelled to produce the information under court order, the contractor will notify VA of the disclosure as soon as practical. The notice under this provision will include the following information to the extent that the contractor knows it, if it does not show on the face of the court order: the records disclosed pursuant to the order, to whom, where, and when, for what purpose, and any other information that the contractor reasonably believes is relevant to the disclosure.
i. The contractor will refer all requests or demands for production of , or access to, VA data and systems to VA for response. The contractor will immediately inform VA by telephone, fax and/or e-mail of any access, disclosure, disposition or destruction of VA data and systems not authorized under the contract or this agreement. To the extent known, the contractor will notify VA of the information disclosed, to whom, how when, the reason for the access, disclosure, disposition or destruction, and any other information that the contractor considers relevant. VA will provide the contractor with the name, title, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the VA official whom the contractor will notify if the records are requested, sought under a court order, or if any unauthorized access, modification, disposition, or destruction of VA sensitive information or computer systems occurs.
j. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees will cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority response for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any unauthorized access, disclosure, disposition, or destruction of VA property. The contractor will also cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA property, to obtain monetary or other compensation for a third party, or to obtain injunctive relief against any third party who accessed, modified, disclosed, or destroyed VA sensitive data and computer systems except as authorized under the contract or this agreement.
k. Upon completion or termination of the contract for any reason, the contractor will immediately deliver all VA records, data, copies of VA records and data, software and equipment, and information about VA data and systems recorded or documented by the contractor, in its possession or the possession of any subcontractors, to the VA official designated in the contract or pursuant to this agreement. The contractor will not retain any copies of any of these documents.
l. All additions to, or modifications of, this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.
m. This agreement is made under, and shall be governed by, the laws of the United States.
4. SECURITY
a. Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall satisfy all requirements for appropriate security eligibility in dealing with access to sensitive information and information systems belonging to or being used on behalf of VA. To satisfy VA requirements, procedures defined in VA Directive & Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program are required.
b. The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO). Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations.
c. All costs associated with obtaining clearances for contractor provided personnel will be the responsibility of the contractor. Further, the contractor will be responsible for the actions of all individuals provided to work for VA under this contract. In the event that damages arise from work performed by contractor provided personnel, under the auspices of this contract, the contractor will be responsible for all resources necessary to remedy the incident.
5. SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTEGRITY
The contractor warrants and represents that the contractor-supplied software, other than the key software, does not and will not contain any program routine, device, code, or instructions (including any code or instructions provided by third parties) or other undisclosed feature, including, without limitation, a time bomb, virus, software lock, drop-dead device, malicious logic, worm, Trojan horse, bug, error, defect, or trap door, that is capable of accessing, modifying, deleting, damaging, disabling, deactivating, interfering with or otherwise harming the contractor software, any computers, networks, data, or other electronically stored information, or computer programs or systems (collectively, ""disabling procedures""). Such representation and warranty applies regardless of whether such disabling procedures are authorized by the contractor to be included in the contractor software.
If the contractor incorporates into the contractor software programs or routines supplied by other vendors, licensors, or contractors (other than the key software), the contractor shall obtain comparable warranties from such providers, or the contractor shall take appropriate action to ensure that such programs or routines are free of disabling procedures. Notwithstanding any other limitations in this agreement, the contractor agrees to notify VA immediately upon discovery of any disabling procedures that are or may be included in the contractor software. If disabling procedures are discovered or reasonably suspect to be present in the contractor software, the contractor, as its entire liability and VA's sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty in this section, agrees to take action immediately, at its own expense, to identify and eradicate (or to equip VA to identify and eradicate) such disabling procedures and carry out any recovery necessary to remedy any impact of such disabling procedures.

(2) Any supplies or parts thereof corrected or furnished in replacement shall be subject to the conditions of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. This warranty shall be equal in duration to that set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies. (3) The Contractor shall not be obligated to correct or replace supplies if the facilities, tooling, drawings, or other equipment or supplies necessary to accomplish the correction or replacement have been made unavailable to the Contractor by action of the Government. In the event that correction or replacement has been directed, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the nonavailability. (4) The Contractor shall also prepare and furnish to the Government data and reports applicable to any correction required (including revision and updating of all affected data called for under this contract) at no increase in the contract price.

(2) If the Contracting Officer does not require correction or replacment of defective or nonconforming supplies or the Contractor is not obligated to correct or replace under paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Government shall be entitled to an equitable reduction in the contract price. (3) The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of any breach of the warranty in paragraph (b) of this clause within 45 days after discovery of the defect or intrusion. The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written recommendation within 5 work days as to the corrective action required to remedy the breach. After the notice of breach, but not later than 10 work days after receipt of the Contractor's recommendation for corrective action, the Contracting Officer may, in writing, direct correction or replacement as in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, and the Contractor shall, notwithstanding any disagreement regarding the existence of a breach of warranty, comply with this direction. If it is later determined that the Contractor did not breach the warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the contract price will be equitably adjusted. (4) If supplies are corrected or replaced, the period for notification of a breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall be two years from the furnishing or return by the Contractor to the Government of the corrected or replaced supplies or parts thereof, or, if correction or replacement is effect by the Contractor at a Government or other activity, for two years thereafter.

"MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement ('Agreement"") is made and entered into as of __________, 20__ (""Effective Date"") by and between ______________________________ (“Producer”) and___________________________________, (“Agency”) (each a ""Party"" and collectively referred to herein as the ""Parties"").
For purposes of this Agreement “Agency” means the undersigned Advertising Agency, “Client” means the advertiser client of the Agency identified on the signature page of this Agreement; “Commercial” means a commercial production referred to in the Producer’s bid/specification form. The term “Agency Affiliate” means (i) the wholly owned subsidiary of the Agency’s parent (“Owner”) where the Agency is also a wholly owned subsidiary (ii) which Agency Affiliate is an advertising agency and does not operate as a commercial production, post production business or acts as an in-house cost consulting entity. Agency represents that it is soliciting bona fide bids for the production of the Commercial and Producer represents that its bid, if submitted, shall be a bona fide bid. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement are inconsistent with those in Client’s or Agency’s bid/specification form, production agreement or purchase order that address the subject matter of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Agency is signing this Agreement for itself and for its Client who is also a “Party,” “Recipient” and “Discloser” under this Agreement.
Now, therefore, the Parties agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information. Each Party receiving Confidential Information (as defined below) (each, a ""Recipient,"" and together, the ""Recipients""), is receiving confidential disclosure of certain confidential or proprietary technical, business, operational, financial and/or commercial information, trade secret information and/or any information of the other designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or by similar designation, or which under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential (""Confidential Information"") for the purpose of exploring, establishing, performing or carrying out a contractual business relationship for the production by the Producer of the Commercial and/or other commercial productions for the Client (collectively and severally, the “Transaction""). Each disclosing Party (each a ""Discloser"") would not disclose its Confidential Information without the Recipient's agreement to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence and to use such Confidential Information solely as permitted under this Agreement. Confidential Information can be in any form (e.g. electronic, digital, analog, hard copy or oral). Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Party to disclose its Confidential Information.
Specifically, with respect to the Producer, the term “Confidential Information” includes confidential and proprietary information of Producer disclosed in connection with the Transaction (during each phase including pre-production, conference(s), pre-bid, bid, production, shoot, wrap and post-production) and regardless of whether a commercial production project is awarded to Producer, including, but not limited to, production costs, discounts, bids, budgets, treatments, prices, relationships with employees, independent contractors and vendors, specifications, sources, layouts, breakdowns, approach to a commercial project, financial and technical information, ideas, designs, specifications, techniques, models, data, programs, processes, technologies and methods of producing the work, all customized terms of, and attachments to, the Producer’s bid/specification form or production contract or other production documents, processes, know-how, customer lists, marketing plans, systems and reports, and information discussed by Producer at any Agency or Client meetings.
2. Non-Use and Non-Disclosure. Recipients will not disclose, distribute, copy or use any Confidential Information or the fact that a Transaction is being considered or is under a production contract without the prior written consent of the other Party and then only to the extent specified in such consent. Confidential Information may be used only to the extent reasonably required for the purposes of evaluating, producing or carrying out the Transaction; provided however, that Recipients may only disclose the Confidential Information to those of its contractors, vendors, directors, officers, advisors, agents and employees (""Representatives"") who need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating, performing or carrying out or producing the Transaction and who shall be bound by a written agreement or other legally enforceable written obligations to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives, whether or not such Representatives are associated with the Discloser at the time of the breach.
Without limiting the foregoing, where the Discloser is the Producer and a Recipient Representative is a cost consultant of the Client or Agency, the Recipient shall secure its Representative’s express written agreement that it will not make any business or other use of, and will in perpetuity hold in confidence, all Confidential Information acquired or learned by such Representative and shall not use or disclose such information except as permitted in this Agreement. Prohibited uses and disclosures by such Representative include, but are not limited to, uses for or disclosures to a competitor of the Producer and uses for or disclosures to any other client or prospective client of such Representative, regardless of whether the Confidential Information is aggregated with other information or its not identified with the Producer.
Producer Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Owner (unless an independent third party is required by the FTC/DOJ) for purposes permitted under this Agreement and disclosed, on an aggregate basis, to other Agency Affiliates provided: (i) the Owner and each Agency Affiliate Recipient agrees to be bound by this Agreement; (ii) Producer Confidential Information to be disclosed is at least three months old; (iii) Producer Confidential Information is aggregated with similar types of confidential information of at least 4 other commercial producers with whom the Agency or Agency Affiliate have contracted to produce commercials and who have consented in writing to have their confidential information aggregated and disclosed in accordance with this procedure provided however that no aggregated producer confidential information represents more than 25% on a weighted basis of any statistic and further provided that all information is sufficiently aggregated such that it would not allow a Recipient to identify the Confidential Information of the Producer or of any other producer whose confidential information is aggregated.
The obligations of confidentiality in this Agreement do not extend to any item of Confidential Information which (i) is publicly known at the time of its disclosure, (ii) is lawfully received by a Recipient from a third party not known to the Recipient to be under a similar confidential agreement to this Agreement or under obligation of confidentiality to the Discloser, (iii) is published or otherwise made known to the public by the Discloser of Confidential Information, (iv) was generated independently by the receiving Recipient without reliance on Confidential Information (as proven by supporting documentation evidencing such independent generation) or (v) was received either prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement or was received for the first time only after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
3. Maintenance of Confidentiality. Recipient agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable measures. Recipient shall reproduce Discloser's proprietary rights notices on any copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original. Recipient shall immediately notify Discloser upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information.
If the Recipient receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of a valid subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental body, Recipient agrees to (i) immediately notify the Discloser of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that the Discloser may seek an appropriate protective order or other reliable written assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to Confidential Information, and (ii) only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed. At all times, the Discloser shall retain sole ownership of its Confidential Information.
4. Return of Materials. At the request of the Discloser, Recipient will promptly return to the Discloser or at Discloser’s instructions destroy any written or electronic Confidential Information and all physical media on which Confidential Information was received from the other Recipient, including any copies thereof, with a letter confirming that the Confidential Information has not been reproduced or copied or that all copies have been returned and that none of the Confidential Information was disclosed to anyone except in accordance with this Agreement. The Recipient and its Representatives shall not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of such written or electronic material, except as may be needed to comply with applicable law and, provided that Recipient may retain one copy of Confidential Information in its confidential files for use only in the event a dispute arises between the Parties hereunder and only in connection with that dispute.
5. No Warranty. All confidential information is provided ""as is"" and Disclosers make no warranties of any kind, express, implied or otherwise, regarding the accuracy, utility, completeness or performance of any Confidential Information.
6. No License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to the Recipient in any copyrights or other intellectual property of the Discloser, nor shall this Agreement grant any Party any proprietary rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other Party.
7. Term. Recipient's obligations under this Agreement with respect to disclosures of Confidential Information made hereunder shall expire five (5) years from the date this Agreement is executed by the Parties.
8. Remedies.

THIS AGREEMENT between _ , a corporation having offices at ( Company ), and AMPHENOL Tuchel Industrial GmbH, (“Amphenol”), is effective as
WHEREAS, for the purpose stated in Section 2 below, Company and Amphenol (collectively referred to as the “Parties” and individually referred to as a “Party”) have determined to establish terms governing the use and protection of Confidential Information (as defined in Section 1 below) that one Party (“Owner”) may disclose to the other Party (“the Recipient”).
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:
1. “Confidential Information” means information that relates to the purpose stated in Section 2 below that has been designated as proprietary by the disclosing party with an appropriate conspicuous stamp or legend on the document exchanged or, although not related to such purpose, is nevertheless disclosed, and that should reasonably have been understood by the Recipient, because of appropriate and conspicuous legends or other markings, to be proprietary and confidential to the Owner, an Affiliate of the Owner or to a third party. The term “Affiliate” means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling controlled by, or under common control with a Party. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form (including magnetic media) or by oral, visual or other means. In addition, information and data disclosed orally shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement provided; (a) the disclosing party clearly identifies the orally disclosed data as proprietary at the time of disclosure, and (b) such orally disclosed data is subsequently reduced to writing, marked with an appropriate stamp or legend and provided in writing as Confidential Information pursuant to Article 2 within ten (10) days of such oral disclosures.
2. Confidential Information disclosed hereunder is intended to be used for the purpose of discussing the following general business opportunities: (the “Purpose”).
3. The Recipient shall protect such Confidential Information from disclosure to others, using the same degree of care used to protect its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance, but in any case using no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information received hereunder to (i) its Affiliates, to its employees and agents, and its Affiliates’ employees and agents, who have a need to know the Confidential Information, and who agree to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure. Confidential Information shall be used solely for the Purpose and shall not otherwise be disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the Owner.
4. The restrictions of this Agreement on use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information, which is:
(a) in the public domain as of the date of this Agreement or which later comes into the domain from a source other than the Recipient;
(b) in the Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time of Owner’s communication thereof to the Recipient;
(c) developed by the Recipient independently of and without reference to any of the Owner’s Confidential Information or other information that the Owner disclosed in confidence to any third party and there is tangible evidence to support such independent development;
(d) rightfully obtained by the Recipient from third parties authorized to make such disclosure without restriction; or
(e) approved for release by prior written authorization of the Owner.
5. In the event the Recipient is required by law, regulation or court order to disclose any of the Owner’s Confidential Information, the Recipient will promptly notify the Owner in writing prior to making any such disclosure in order to facilitate seeking a protective order by the Owner or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority. The Recipient agrees to cooperate with the Owner in seeking such order or other remedy. The Recipient further agrees that if the Owner is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information, which it is legally required, and it will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.
6. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement (including without limitation, information in computer software or held in electronic storage media) shall be and remain the property of the Owner. All such Confidential Information in tangible form shall be returned to the Owner promptly upon written request or the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and shall not thereafter be retained in any form by the Recipient, its Affiliates, or any employees or independent contractors of the Recipient or its Affiliates. The Recipient shall also certify to the Owner the timely destruction of all copies of Confidential Information and all notes and memoranda, in whatever form maintained, incorporating any Confidential Information.
The Parties’ representatives primarily responsible for coordinating disclosure and receipt of Confidential Information and further responsible for destruction and/or return of Confidential Information, upon termination of this Agreement are:

Any notice required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be given in writing to the individuals whose names are set forth above either via hand delivery or by confirmed facsimile transmission or by Federal Express or comparable overnight carrier.
7. No licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement. Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information which it does not wish to disclose or to enter into any other agreement or transaction or to purchase from or provide to the other Party any service or product.
8. The Owner represents that it has the authority to disclose to the Recipient any Confidential Information, which it elects to disclose hereunder. The Owner shall not, however, have any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in, or any decisions made by the Recipient in reliance on, any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.
9. Each party agrees to protect Confidential Information received from the other by exercising, at a minimum, the same level of care it uses to protect its own confidential information and agrees that it will (a) use such Confidential Information only for the purposes of this Agreement; (b) only make such Confidential Information available to its employees having a “need to know”; (c) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third person, except that Confidential Information may be disclosed to the demand of the Government (d) not copy or reproduce Confidential Information in whole or in part, except as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, provided that, if they do copy or reproduce Confidential Information in whole or in part, the reproduction shall carry a proprietary notice or legend similar to that which appears on the original; (e) not manufacture, sell, use, or have made devices embodying or utilizing Confidential Information, except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.
10. Except as may be required by law or to enforce the terms hereof, neither Party shall disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement, or the substance of any discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement.
11. The Parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is unique and valuable, and that disclosure in breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Owner for which monetary damages alone may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, the Parties agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality, the Owner shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or anticipated breach without the necessity of posting a bond. Any such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages.
12. Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except to an Affiliate or successor in interest, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
13. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
14. This Agreement: (a) is the complete agreement of the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior such agreements with respect to further disclosures concerning such subject matter; (b) may not be amended or in any manner modified except by a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both Parties; and (c) shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany without regard to its choice of law provisions.
15. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the Parties as expressed herein.
16. In addition to all remedies available in law and equity, a party who breaches or attempts to breach this Agreement shall be liable to the other party for all legal fees and costs incurred in the successful enforcement of this Agreement or the successful establishment of breach of this Agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative.

1. Definition. CI means Discloser’s non-public written information, in any form, and all copies, summaries and extracts which is identified in writing as confidential at the time of disclosure, and any information disclosed in non-tangible form that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and summarized in a writing labelled as “confidential” delivered to Recipient within 15 days after disclosure.

2. Confidentiality Obligations.

Recipient is responsible for any breach of this NDA by any of its representatives. Recipient will not modify, reverse engineer, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the CI without Discloser’s prior written consent.

Unless expressly set forth in this NDA, Recipient does not receive any license or intellectual property rights to Discloser’s CI. Each party agrees that Recipient (A) may independently develop and acquire software, hardware, and other technology for its own products, services, and processes, and that having access to Discloser’s CI does not prohibit Recipient from freely developing or acquiring similar products without obligation to Discloser; and (B) is free to use the residuals of CI for any purpose, where “residuals” means that CI disclosed in non-tangible form that may be retained in the memories of representatives of Recipient.
4. Termination. Either party may terminate this NDA upon 10 days’ written notice. However, all CI provided under this NDA will remain subject to the terms of this NDA.
5. General. All CI is provided “AS IS” and all warranties, express, implied, or otherwise are disclaimed.

The parties will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations in their use and disclosure of CI. This NDA may be executed in counterparts and may be signed electronically or with handwritten signatures. The English language version of this NDA will be the version used if any dispute arises.

THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into this _____________ day of _______________________, 20___, between Champion Aerospace LLC, a Delaware corporation (“Champion”), and _____________________________________________________________________, a _____________________ corporation (“Company”). When Champion or Company receives Confidential Information (as defined herein) from the other party, it is a “receiving party” hereunder, and when Champion or Company discloses Confidential Information to the other party, it is a “disclosing party” hereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means confidential and proprietary information (regardless of whether such Confidential Information is in written, oral, visual or electronic form) (a) that consists of Trade Secrets (as hereinafter defined), discoveries, technical, engineering, financial, pricing and/or other business data and documentation, sales information, inventions, know-how, manufacturing techniques and specifications, process technologies, business plans, all disclosed by the disclosing party in furtherance of the purpose set forth in Section 2; (b) regarding the current and/or prospective business of the disclosing party; or (c) that is marked as confidential, proprietary or privileged by the disclosing party. “Trade Secrets” means any business or technical information (including but not limited to a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process) that derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable through independent development or through reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and that is the subject of efforts reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy thereof. The existence of a Trade Secret will not be negated merely because the information comprising the Trade Secret has also been developed and used by or owned independently by more than one person, or has been licensed to any other persons.
2. Use of Confidential Information. The receiving party is entitled to use the Confidential Information of the disclosing party solely for the purpose of quoting and manufacturing products for Champion. .

No public announcement or disclosure of the purpose set forth in this Agreement is to be made by either party unless such announcement has been approved by both parties.
3. Duties with respect to Confidential Information. The receiving party shall exercise the same degree of care and protection with respect to the Confidential Information of the disclosing party that it exercises with respect to the protection of its own confidential information of a similar nature but not less than a reasonable degree of care and shall prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information to anyone except to those of its employees that have a need to know such information solely in connection with the permitted use as set forth in Section 2 and who shall be required to observe the restrictions set forth in this Agreement. The receiving party shall not disclose, disseminate, discuss or communicate any part or all of the Confidential Information to any third party, person or entity. Confidential Information shall be used by the receiving party only for the purpose set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement and for no other purpose whatsoever. The receiving party will report immediately to the disclosing party any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.
[Company] will promptly disclose to Champion any Confidential Information developed, discovered or invented by Company in connection with the design, manufacture and supply of products to Champion. Furthermore, at the request of Champion, Company will promptly deliver to Champion all Confidential Information and all documents and materials (whether in written, graphic or machine readable form and all copies thereof) that were made or compiled by Company during the course of Company’s relationship with Champion. Company acknowledges that all such Confidential Information, and any improvements or derivations of any intellectual property used in the course of such relationship, is and shall continue to be the exclusive proprietary property of Champion, whether or not prepared in whole or in part by Company and whether or not disclosed to or entrusted to the custody of Company. Confidential Information created by Company will be considered a work for hire in which the ownership of all right, title and interest therein and thereto vests in Champion. To the extent Confidential Information created by Company is not considered a work for hire, Company will assign, and upon creation thereof does hereby assign, to Champion all right, title and interest in and to such Confidential Information, including any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret rights therein.
Company is or may become a supplier of products to Champion. Any processes, tooling and or equipment owned by Champion and used by Company are to be used exclusively by Company in the production of products for or on behalf of Champion.

4. Exceptions to Confidentiality.

6. Breach. The receiving party acknowledges and agrees that the disclosing party’s remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that in the event of any actual or threatened breach by the receiving party of any of its obligations imposed by this Agreement, the disclosing party shall have the right to a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent or minimize such breach. The receiving party hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, the requirement that the disclosing party post bond prior to entry of an injunction and also waives in such injunction proceeding the defense that disclosing party has an adequate remedy at law.
7. Term; Return of Confidential Information.
7.1 Unless terminated earlier by mutual agreement of the parties or terminated by Champion in the event of breach by Company of any obligation set forth herein, the term of this Agreement shall continue until the

8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be deemed to be executed within and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of South Carolina, without regard to conflicts of law principles. The parties agree that any suit, action, or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement be brought in the State or Federal Courts situated in Greenville County, SC, that the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of any such court, and that the parties irrevocably waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such court is an inconvenient forum.
9. Regulatory Compliance; Export Control. Company understands and agrees that the information disclosed, made available, or provided herein is private, confidential, proprietary, and may also be controlled technical data or technology under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), or subject to other laws or regulations. Company agrees and covenants that it will not release, show, make available, disclose or deliver in any form or fashion all or any part of this information to any person who is not a U.S. Citizen, a lawful permanent resident of the United States (i.e., valid “Green Card” holder – a Visa is irrelevant for this purpose), or who has received Political Asylum in the United States without first having determined whether it is lawful to do so under U.S. laws including the EAR, ITAR , and OFAC. Further, Company will not release, show, make available, disclose or deliver in any form or fashion all or any part of this information to any non-U.S. Person without having first obtained the necessary license or approval that may be required from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Department of State, Department of Treasury, or other agency, department, or office. Company agrees that if a license or other approval is necessary it will promptly advise Champion in writing of its determination and confirm that it has not released any controlled technical data or technology and that it is seeking a license or other approval.
10. Assignment. Neither this Agreement, nor any rights or obligations hereunder, may be assigned or delegated by either party without the prior written consent of the other party. This Agreement shall benefit and be binding upon the parties hereto together with its respective employees, officers, directors, subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates.
11. Miscellaneous. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all existing agreements and all other communications between them concerning such subject matter, whether written or oral. This Agreement shall not be modified except in writing signed by all parties hereto. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. In the event any term of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, neither the validity of the remaining part of such term nor the validity of any other term of this Agreement shall in any way be affected thereby and the provisions shall be reformed as necessary to carry out the intent of the parties to the fullest extent permitted by law.

RECITAL
Disclosing Party desires to provide Receiving Party with certain of its proprietary and confidential information for the limited purpose of evaluating the possibility of engaging in a mutually beneficial transaction or relationship. In consideration thereof, and as a condition to disclosure of such information, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

(d) use, and require its Representatives to use, the Confidential Information only for the purpose expressly stated herein; provided that nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit or prevent either Party from continuing to operate its business in the ordinary course, including conducting business with any person who happens also to be a customer or vendor of the other Party.
3. Neither Party hereto shall be obligated to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information that:
(a) prior to any disclosure by Disclosing Party was known by Receiving Party, free of any known obligation to keep it confidential;
(b) is or becomes publicly available by other than unauthorized disclosure by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives;
(c) can verifiably be shown to have been developed by Receiving Party or its Representatives independently of any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party; or
(d) is disclosed by a third party, which disclosure does not violate any obligation of confidentiality.
4. Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party pursuant to a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency; provided that Receiving Party only discloses that portion of the Confidential Information that is specifically required by the order, and further provided that Receiving Party provides Disclosing Party with: (a) prior written notice of such order, and (b) reasonable opportunity to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order or similar relief.

6. The disclosure of any Confidential Information by Disclosing Party under the terms of this Agreement does not constitute a representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee or inducement by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information.
7. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party unless such Confidential Information is sold by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives any rights by license or otherwise in any Confidential Information, or under any trademark, patent, patent application, design work, copyright, trade secret or any other property right now owned or hereafter owned or controlled by Disclosing Party.
8. At any time upon written demand by Disclosing Party, Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately return (or, at the option of Disclosing Party, destroy) all tangible or electronic Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives under this Agreement, along with all copies, extracts and reproductions of such information and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, specifications, designs, plans, enhancements, data, prototypes, derivative works and all other works prepared by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that are derived from or based on any of the Confidential Information.

Provided, however, that Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information, subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement, in accordance with their respective internal record retention policies for legal, compliance or regulatory purposes or to establish the rights of Receiving Party and its Representatives under this Agreement.

11. Receiving Party acknowledges that any disclosure or misappropriation of any of the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement may cause Disclosing Party irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to ascertain and, therefore, agrees that Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies and relief that would be available at law or in equity without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be waived, amended or modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which such waiver, amendment or modification is sought to be enforced. The term “person” as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any individual, group or entity. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement is not assignable and is binding on any successors of Receiving Party. If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason adjudged to be void, invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement shall continue and remain in full force and effect.

Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
5. No Grant of Rights. No license, intellectual property right or other ownership or use right is conveyed solely by this Agreement, except the limited right to use Confidential Information described in Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement.
6.

"CONFIDENTIALITY, NON-DISCLOSURE & APPROPRIATE USE AGREEMENT
FAU has a legal responsibility to safeguard the confidentiality and security of our patients’ protected health information (“PHI”) as well as operational, proprietary, and student and employee information (collectively “FAU Confidential Information”). This information may include, but is not limited to, patient health records, as well as information regarding human resources, payroll, fiscal matters, research, and strategic planning, and may exist in any form, including electronic, video, spoken, or written. This Agreement applies to all members of the workforce, including but not limited to, employees, volunteers, students, faculty, physicians, and third parties, whether temporary or permanent, paid or not paid, visiting, or designated as affiliates or associates, who are employed by, contracted with, or under the direct control of FAU. This Agreement also applies to all users who are granted access to FAU-issued computing and technology resources (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, printers, etc.), application systems or access to the FAU network, whether the user is affiliated with FAU or not, and whether access to or use of the information systems occurs locally or from remote locations. I hereby agree as follows:
 I will maintain patient privacy and protect and safeguard the confidentiality and security of PHI and FAU Confidential Information in accordance with Florida and federal laws and FAU policies and procedures.
 I understand that access to health information created, received, or maintained by FAU or its affiliates is limited to those who have a valid business, medical, or professional need to know the information. I understand that FAU has implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of PHI, and I agree not to bypass or disable these safeguards.
 I will not disclose any PHI to any individual or third party, except as specifically authorized by FAU policies and procedures, and upon receiving a written authorization from the patient (unless otherwise required by applicable law), and then only on a need-to-know basis.
 I will not use any PHI in an inappropriate, unethical, detrimental or unauthorized manner.
 I will not discuss any information regarding FAU or patients in an area where unauthorized individuals may overhear such information, including waiting rooms, hallways, elevators and other public areas. I understand that it is strictly prohibited to discuss any FAU Confidential Information or PHI in public areas even if a patient’s name is not used.
 I understand that I will be given a unique User ID and password to access electronic health, operational, proprietary, student or employee or other confidential information. I understand that my User ID and password are confidential, may only be used by me, that I am responsible for safekeeping my password, that I am also responsible for any activity initiated by my User ID and password, and that in certain circumstances my User ID and password may be equivalent to my legal signature. If I suspect that my User ID or password has been compromised, I should immediately contact FAU’s Office of Information Technology (“FAU OIT”).
 I have no expectation of privacy when using FAU information systems. FAU shall have the right to record, audit, log, and/or monitor access to or use of its information systems that is attributed to my User ID. I agree to practice good workstation security measures on any computing device that uses or accesses a FAU information system. Good security measures include, but are not limited to, maintaining physical security of electronic devices, never leaving a device unattended while in use, and adequately shielding the screen from unauthorized viewing by others.
 I understand that only encrypted and password protected devices may be used to transport PHI or other Restricted Data (defined below).
 I understand that smartphones and other mobile devices used to access FAU information systems must be configured to encrypt any Restricted or Sensitive Data (defined below), including photographs and videos, in persistent storage.

1. Defined Terms.
(a) “Confidential Information” shall include all information pertaining to the Assignors and their respective affiliates, employees, salespersons, independent contractors, agents, officers, directors, customers, suppliers, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, dealers, predecessors, successors and assigns disclosed by the Disclosing Party (or by a third party at the direction of the Disclosing Party) to the Receiving Party, regardless of the form or manner of disclosure (including, but not limited to, information learned by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party’s employees, agents, officers, directors, professional advisors or other representatives or through inspection of the Assigned Assets or the books and records of the Assignors), and including, but not limited to: (i) information that relates to the Assignors’ trade secrets, products, services, product specifications, data, inventions, ideas, techniques, know-how, past, current and planned research and development, current and planned methods and processes, client lists, current and anticipated client, service provider and consultant requirements, price lists, market studies, business strategy and plans, business opportunities, computer hardware, software and programs (including object codes and source codes), computer database technologies and systems, and distribution, marketing, financial, merchandising, customer, sales and/or salary information; (ii) all information concerning the Assignors’ business and affairs, operations, finances, assets, liabilities, forecasts, historical financial statements, financial projections and budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending, budgets, strategic plans, marketing and advertising plans, publications, agreements, the names and backgrounds of clients and consultants and other service providers, key personnel, personnel training, and techniques and materials; (iii) third party confidential information in the custody or care of the Disclosing Party to the extent the same is subject to a duty of confidentiality to such third party; (iv) all offering documents and materials (including offering memoranda, supplements thereto and similar documents); (v) all notes, analyses, compilations, statistics, studies, summaries, interpretations, and other material prepared by or for the Receiving Party which contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect, in whole or in part, any of the foregoing; and (vi) the existence and terms and conditions of this Agreement and the existence and content of the discussions between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party regarding a Possible Transaction. Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party need not be identified as “confidential” to be deemed “Confidential Information” pursuant to this Agreement.
(b) “Confidential Materials” shall mean all materials containing Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all writings and recordings, including the originals and all non-identical copies, whether different from the original by reason of any notation made on such copies or otherwise (including, without limitation, e-mails and attachments, correspondence, memoranda, notes, diaries, minutes, statistics, statements, tags, labels, invoices, brochures, periodicals, telegrams, receipts, returns, summaries, pamphlets, books, inter-office and intra-office communications, offers, notations of any sort of conversations, working papers, applications, permits, file wrappers, indices, telephone calls, meetings or printouts, teletypes, telefaxes, invoices, work sheets, and all drafts, alterations, modifications, changes and amendments of any of the foregoing), and graphic or aural representations of any kind (including, without limitation, photographs, charts, microfiche, microfilm, video tape, recordings, motion pictures, plans, drawings, and surveys), and all materials within the full scope of FED.R.CIV.P. 34 including, but not limited to, all electronic, mechanical, magnetic, or optical records or representations of any kind (including, without limitation, computer files and programs, tapes, cassettes, discs, recordings), metadata, and information stored on a computer, laptop, hand-held computer device, disk, CD, DVD, and any mechanical recording or production of any oral material.
2. Trade Secrets. All trade secrets of the Assignors also shall be entitled to all of the protections and benefits of the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the “Trade Secrets Act”) and any other applicable laws. If any information that the Disclosing Party deems to be a trade secret of the Assignors is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade secret, then such information nevertheless shall be considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement. In the case of trade secrets, the Receiving Party waives any requirement that the Disclosing Party submit proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a bond or other security. Additionally, the Receiving Party acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement (including Section 17 below) shall place a time limitation on the period of protection of such trade secret, it being agreed that the trade secrets of the Assignors shall enjoy perpetual protection against unauthorized disclosure or use, subject only to the provisions of the Trade Secrets Act and other applicable laws.
3. Limitations. The term “Confidential Information” shall not include such portions of the Confidential Information that: (i) are already published or available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors (collectively, the “Representatives”); (ii) become available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Disclosing Party or one of the Disclosing Party’s employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors) that is not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party by a legal, contractual, or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party or the Assignors; (iii) can be shown by written documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reliance upon any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials of the Disclosing Party; and/or (iv) was demonstrably within the actual possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives prior to it being furnished by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant to this Agreement.
4. Property of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials are and shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. By disclosing information to the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right or interest in the patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret information, or intellectual property rights of the Assignors. The Disclosing Party reserves the right to limit the Receiving Party’s access to the premises, facilities, equipment, customers, vendors, data and other materials, information and personnel of the Assignors (including, without limitation, as provided in Section 9 below).
5. Non-Disclosure. The Receiving Party: (i) shall treat the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials as confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) shall not use or disclose to any person the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials for any purpose other than in connection with the consideration of a Possible Transaction, subject in all cases to the provisions of this Agreement; (iii) shall not copy or reproduce any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; (iv) shall reveal the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials only to its Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials in connection with a Possible Transaction, and who (A) are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials, and (B) before receiving the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, agree to maintain their confidentiality in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (v) except as provided in Section 7 below, shall not, without the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent, disclose (A) to any other person, other than its Representatives, the fact that the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials have been made available to the Receiving Party, (B) that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction, or (C) any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect thereto; (vi) shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials from disclosure to any person or entity other than its Representatives, including taking reasonable security precautions at least as great as the precautions the Receiving Party takes to protect its own confidential information; and (vii) segregate all Confidential Information and Confidential Materials from the confidential information or confidential materials of others. At the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall require its Representatives to sign a copy of this Agreement. Regardless of whether the Receiving Party’s Representatives sign a copy of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives, and shall fully cooperate with the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials and prevent the unauthorized use of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials.
6. Return of Confidential Information and Confidential Materials. The Receiving Party shall keep a written record of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials furnished to it and the location of such Confidential Information and Confidential Materials. At any time, at the Disclosing Party’s request, all copies of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials shall be returned to the Disclosing Party within five (5) business days of such request; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall be permitted to retain a list that contains general descriptions of the documents it has returned to the Disclosing Party to facilitate the resolution of any controversies after the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials have been returned. To the extent that the Receiving Party utilizes any portion of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to prepare its own analyses, compilations, studies, data, notes, interpretations or other documents (the “Notes”), at any time, at the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party shall destroy the Notes and promptly thereafter provide the Disclosing Party with written certification of their destruction. The Receiving Party shall also, within ten (10) days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, certify in writing that it has satisfied its obligations under this Section 6 or explain why the Receiving Party has been unable to do so. All Confidential Information and Confidential Materials shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement even after their return or destruction or the termination of this Agreement.
7. Legal Compulsion to Disclose Confidential Information or Confidential Materials. In the event that the Receiving Party is issued any subpoena or other process requesting any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, the Receiving Party agrees that it will immediately furnish a copy of such subpoena or other process, via overnight delivery, to counsel to the Assignee, Edward J. Peterson, Esq. and Matthew B. Hale, Esq. of Stichter, Riedel, Blain & Postler, P.A., 110 East Madison Street, Suite 200, Tampa, Florida 33602, and to the Disclosing Party at the address set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, then the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Receiving Party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials which the Receiving Party determines in its reasonable discretion is required to be disclosed and the Receiving Party shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance from the person to whom it furnishes the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information or Confidential Materials. The Receiving Party also agrees that it will, to the extent authorized by law, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party in opposing the production of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials; provided, however, in the event the Receiving Party incurs any cost or expense in providing such cooperation, the Disclosing Party shall promptly reimburse the Receiving Party for any such cost or expense upon the Receiving Party’s tendering of a receipt therefor. If an opinion of independent counsel is required prior to compliance with a subpoena or court order, the Disclosing Party agrees to reimburse the Receiving Party for the associated costs.
8. Attorney-Client Privilege. The Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived, its attorney-client privilege with respect to any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials (including, without limitation, Confidential Information or Confidential Materials pertaining to pending or threatened litigation) which may be disclosed hereunder by the Disclosing Party and with respect to which the Disclosing Party has asserted, or is entitled to assert, its attorney-client privilege. The Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to require that such Confidential Information or Confidential Materials be disclosed only to certain specified Representatives and to the Receiving Party’s legal counsel and that no further disclosure thereof be made.
9. HIPAA Compliance. The Receiving Party agrees that it will not have access to any patient care information or records of the Assignors that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), absent the execution of a separate agreement that addresses HIPAA requirements. Until the consummation of the Possible Transaction, the Receiving Party agrees that it shall not contact or otherwise communicate with any patients (past, present, or future) of the Assignors without obtaining the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party and allowing one or more Representatives of the Disclosing Party to be present at the time of any meetings with any such patients. To the extent confidential patient or other information protected by HIPAA is inadvertently disclosed to the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party shall hold such information in strictest confidence, shall notify the Disclosing Party of its receipt of such information, and shall promptly thereafter return such information to the Disclosing Party and destroy any and all copies thereof. This Section 9 shall survive the closing of the Possible Transaction and/or the termination of this Agreement.
10. Remedies. The Receiving Party shall indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party harmless from any damages, losses, costs, or liabilities arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and other litigation expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials and the damage that would result to the Disclosing Party if information contained therein were disclosed to any third party, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives.

The Parties further agree that unless and until a Definitive Agreement between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction (including, without limitation, any obligation to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract) by reason of this Agreement, the transmission of any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, any written or oral expression with respect to a Possible Transaction or for any other reason.

"CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND NON-DISCLOSURE STATEMENT
The undersigned Prospective Investor (“Investor”) is executing this Agreement as of _____________________,20__, in connection with the distribution of certain confidential information relative to the possible retail/commercial development site (the ""Development"") offered by (“Owner”). Any and all information, including but not limited to, location, financial information, title reports, surveys, and other agreements, documents, materials and oral and/or written information with respect to the Property, whether delivered or made available concurrently with this Agreement or to be delivered in the future (collectively, the Confidential Information"") shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement
The Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the Investor’s limited use and benefit in determining whether the Investor desires to express any further interest in the acquisition and development of the Property.
With respect to the Confidential Information, the Investor agrees as follows:
1. NON-DISCLOSURE. Investor shall keep the Confidential Information permanently and strictly confidential, and not to disclose or divulge any Confidential Information to, or reproduce any Confidential Information for the benefit of any person or entity other than the Investor’s employees, representatives, consultants, and agents who are actively and directly participating in the analysis of the Development, and in such cases only to the extent reasonably required for such analysis. The Investor also agrees to inform all such employees, representatives, consultants, and agents of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, to provide them with a copy of this Agreement, to obtain their agreement to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to take such other action as may be reasonably necessary to cause such employees to comply with these confidentiality provisions. Investor is strictly prohibited from publishing any news release, public announcement, denial or confirmation with respect to the Development, this Agreement or any information about the Property. The Investor agrees to be fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement caused by such employees, representatives, consultants, and agents.
2. LIMITATION ON USE. Investor’s use of the Confidential Information shall solely be for the purpose of evaluating the Property and the Development. If the Investor elects not to proceed with the Development, or if the undersigned is informed that the Property is no longer available for purchase or if the Investor is otherwise requested by the Owner to return the Confidential Information, the Investor will promptly return all Confidential Information (and all reproductions or destroy electronic copies thereof if any);
3. INDEMNIFICATION. Investor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Owner and its affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, partners, agents and employees) from and against all claims, actions, causes of action, damages, losses and liabilities (including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) arising out of or based upon any breach of this Agreement. The Investor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Owner harmless against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses arising in any way related to claims(s) by another broker, finder or similar agent for commissions, fees or other compensation for bringing about a sale of the Property to the Investor if such claims(s) is based from dealings with the Investor.
The undersigned further understands, warrants and agrees that:
1. Nothing contained in the Confidential Information should be construed as a representation by any person as to the current condition or future performance of the Property. The Confidential Information speaks as of the date thereof and should not be deemed to imply that there has been no change in the condition of the Property since that date. Financial projections, if any, are provided for general reference purposes only, as they are based in part on assumptions about the general economy, competition, and other factors beyond the control of the Owner. Therefore, due to inherent limitations involved in predicting future events, actual cash flows, income and expense will differ from projections and/or from financial conditions in previous years, and the difference may be material.
2. Owner has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information those materials which Owner believes to be reliable and relevant for the purpose of the Investor's evaluation of the Property and the Development, but the Investor acknowledges that neither Owner nor any of its agents, representatives, or employees makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information.
3. The Confidential Information is being delivered or made available to the Investor with the understanding that the Investor will independently investigate all matters that the undersigned deems appropriate in evaluating the Property and the proposed Development.
4. The extent and irreparable nature of the damages that may result from a breach of this Agreement may make Owner’s legal remedies for such a breach inadequate. Therefore, in the event of such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Owner shall be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief without proof of actual damages, in addition, and not in substitution for, any other remedy Owner may have.
5. All written Confidential Information and any copies thereof in the Investor's possession or the possession of the Investor's employees or agents, including, without limitation, that portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Investor, shall be returned to Owner promptly upon its request. All unwritten Confidential Information shall be held by the Investor and kept strictly confidential by the Investor and its employees, representatives, and agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in perpetuity.
6. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan; and in the event of any suit or action or appeal therefrom to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its costs and attorney's fees.
7. Each person executing this Agreement in a representative capacity represents and warrants that he and/or she is authorized to sign this Agreement on behalf of the entity set forth below.
8. The Investor acknowledges that the Confidential Information would not have been furnished to the undersigned in the absence of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not constitute Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement: (i) information that has become generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by or through the Investor or its employees, representatives, and agents; (ii) information that was available to the Investor on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the undersigned by the Owner; and (iii) information that becomes available to the Investor from a source not subject, to the best knowledge of the Investor after due inquiry, to any prohibition against disclosing the information to the undersigned. Undersigned acknowledges that the location of the Property is Confidential Information.
Brokers may not obtain the Confidential Information without first obtaining the signature of a qualified Prospective Investor.

A. EACH PARTY ENVISAGES PROVIDING CERTAIN INFORMATION TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE PURPOSE(S): A POTENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP;
B. EACH PARTY HAS AGREED THAT DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND EXCLUDED INFORMATION
1.1. “Confidential Information” shall mean information that is revealed by or obtained through a party (whether in writing, orally or by any other means) (a “Disclosing Party”) to the other (a “Receiving Party”) including, without limitation, (i) all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information including, for example, pricing, strategies, studies, assessments, plans, compilations, program devices, formulae, designs, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes and any information directly relating to the integrity or security of computer networks or systems; (ii) information traditionally recognized as trade secrets; (iii) all data and information about a party’s customers (current, former or prospective) and Employees and Advisors (as such terms are defined below); (iv) the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Disclosure Purpose); and (v) all copies of any of the foregoing or any analyses, studies or reports that contain, are based on, or reflect any of the foregoing.
1.2. The confidentiality obligations set forth under this Agreement do not extend to Excluded Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Excluded Information” means information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate (i) was known to the Receiving Party without restriction prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (ii) became publicly available through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) was developed at any time by the Receiving Party independent of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
2. RESTRICTED USE
2.1. The Receiving Party must keep Confidential Information under its control, establish and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard Confidential Information and shall treat the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as it protects its own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature but, in any event, with no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall only use the Confidential Information for the Disclosure Purpose.
2.2. The Receiving Party shall not disclose, duplicate, transmit or otherwise disseminate in any manner the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, except to the Receiving Party’s officers, directors and employees (collectively “Employees”), and the Receiving Party’s agents, contractors and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, legal advisors, auditors and accountants) retained by the Receiving Party (collectively “Advisors”). All such persons receiving Confidential Information shall have a need to know and shall be bound by professional duty or in writing (in advance) to confidentiality and non-use obligations at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be liable to the Disclosing Party in the event that any of its Employees or Advisors breach such obligations, and upon the Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party shall promptly provide documentary proof of its compliance with the immediately preceding sentence.
2.3. Each party may only make as many copies of Confidential Information as are reasonably necessary for its permitted use under the terms hereof, and each such copy will be marked with the same proprietary notices, indicia and legends that appear on the originals.
2.4. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information to comply with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or with a mandatory requirement of a governing regulatory body, such party shall, to the extent permitted by law and as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances, inform the Disclosing Party to allow it an adequate opportunity to object to the disclosure order or to take such other actions as are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the information. The Receiving Party shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party in such party’s reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure by means of a protective order or a request for confidential treatment.
3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CURRENT OR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
3.1. As between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, Confidential Information and all applicable intellectual property rights embodied in the Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving Party or any of its Employees or Advisors, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, except to the extent as expressly stated in this Agreement.
3.2. The Disclosing Party understands that Receiving Party may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties that may be similar to Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that Receiving Party will not develop products, or have products developed for it that compete with the products, systems or services contemplated by Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
4. WARRANTIES NOR REPRESENTATIONS
4.1. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RELATION TO ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS OR COMPLETENESS OF ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
5. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE
5.1. Each party agrees to advise the other party promptly in writing of any unauthorized misappropriation, disclosure or use by any person of the other party’s Confidential Information which may come to its attention and to take all steps reasonably requested by the disclosing party to limit, stop or otherwise remedy such misappropriation, disclosure or use.
5.2. The unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information may cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party which could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Each party therefore authorizes the other party to seek any temporary or permanent injunctive relief necessary to prevent such disclosure or use, or threat of disclosure or use.
6. TERM ; TERMINATION ; EFFECTS OF TERMINATION
6.1. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date stated above. This Agreement shall continue in force for three (3) years unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 6.2.
6.2. Each party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason, by serving at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the other party.
6.3. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement the Receiving Party's right to use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information ceases and the Receiving Party must, upon the Disclosing Party’s request and at the Receiving Party’s expense, promptly return to the Disclosing Party or permanently destroy all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in its power, possession or control. Having acknowledged that it, particularly within a networked environment, the return and/or destruction of electronically stored information may be impossible, extremely or otherwise unduly difficult or costly, the immediately preceding sentence is not intended to, and does not obligate the Receiving Party to make extra-ordinary efforts to destroy electronically stored copies of the Confidential Information, provided that, in relation to any such copy that is not destroyed the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use shall continue as per the provisions of this Agreement.
6.4. Notwithstanding Section 6.3, the Receiving Party may retain a reasonable number of copies of the Confidential Information (and any materials embedding the same) (“Retained Copies”) for the sole purpose of (i) satisfying any legal or regulatory requirements regarding record and data retention that the Receiving Party is obligated to comply with; (ii) enforcing this Agreement; and/or (iii) archiving consistent with good business practices and the Receiving Party’s internal policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use as set forth in this Agreement shall continue in respect of such Retained Copies as per the provisions of this Agreement.
6.5. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Receiving Party’s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use hereunder shall continue in force during the term of this Agreement and shall survive for three (3) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement or, in the case of trade secrets, until such time as the Confidential Information does not qualify as a trade secret.
7. GENERAL PROVISIONS
7.1. Notice. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be served in writing to Imperva or Company (as applicable) to the attention of “Legal Department” at the notice address indicated above and will be deemed given: (i) upon receipt if by personal delivery; (ii) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (iii) two (2) days after it is sent if by overnight delivery by a major commercial delivery service.

7.3. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
7.4. Relationship of the Parties. The parties hereto are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between Imperva and Company. Neither party shall have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. This Agreement does not express or imply any commitment on behalf of either party to disclose any particular information to the other party or to purchase or sell goods or services from or to the other party, or to conclude any similar business transaction with the other party.

A provision of or a right created under this Agreement may not be (i) waived except in a writing executed by the party granting the waiver; or (ii) varied except in a writing duly executed by the parties.

"NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT
NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT
This AGREEMENT (this ""Agreement""), is made as of October 7, 2002 (the ""Effective Date""), by and between MERITAGE CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (""Meritage""), MTH-HOMES NEVADA, INC., an Arizona corporation (the ""Company""), ZENITH NATIONAL INSURANCE CORP., a Delaware corporation (""Zenith""), and PERMA-BILT, a Nevada corporation (""Seller"" and, together with Zenith, ""Selling Parties"").
R E C I T A L S
Seller is engaged in homebuilding and home sales operations.
Zenith indirectly owns all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Seller.
The Business will be acquired by the Company pursuant to a Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2002 (the ""Master Agreement""). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Master Agreement.
Selling Parties have intimate knowledge of the business practices of the Business, which, if exploited by Selling Parties in contravention of this Agreement, would seriously, adversely, and irreparably affect the ability of the Company to continue the businesses previously conducted by Seller.
To induce the Company to enter into the Master Agreement, Selling Parties have agreed to execute this Agreement.
In consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and covenants of the parties set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Selling Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
1. Noncompetition.
(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the * anniversary thereof (the ""Restriction Period""), neither Selling Parties nor any subsidiary, sister entity, or parent will, directly or indirectly, either as a partner or owner or in any other capacity:
(i) engage in the homebuilding or home sales business within 100 miles of the Las Vegas metropolitan area (a ""Competing Business"");
(ii) recruit, hire or discuss employment for a Competing Business with any person who is, or within the six month period preceding the date of such activity was, an employee of the Company or Meritage (other than as a result of a general solicitation for employment); or
(iii) solicit any customer or supplier of the Company for a Competing Business or otherwise attempt to induce any such customer or supplier to discontinue its relationship with the Company.
(b) Selling Parties represent to the Company and Meritage, and Selling Parties acknowledge, that:
(i) they are willing and able to engage in a business that is not a Competing Business;
(ii) enforcement of the restrictions set forth in this Section 1 would not be unduly burdensome to Selling Parties;
(iii) the period of time provided for in this Section 1 and the territorial restrictions and other provisions and restrictions set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company and its successors and assigns in the use and employment of the goodwill of the business conducted by Perma-Bilt Homes prior to the Effective Date; and
(iv) damages cannot compensate the Company in the event of a violation of this Section 1, and that if such violation should occur, injunctive relief shall be essential for the protection of the Company and its successors and assigns.
Accordingly, Selling Parties hereby covenant and agree that, in the event any of the provisions of this Section 1 shall be violated or breached, the Company shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the party or parties violating such covenants, without bond but upon due notice, in addition to such further or other relief as may be available at equity or law. Obtainment of such an injunction by the Company shall not be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of any right to assert any other remedies which the Company has at law or in equity. No waiver of any breach or violation hereof shall be implied from forbearance or failure by the Company to take action thereof. Zenith agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing this provision if it is determined that Selling Parties breached this Agreement.
(c) Selling Parties hereby agree that upon becoming a partner, member, owner or investor of another enterprise or any third-party during the period in which the terms of this Section 1 are in effect, each shall promptly disclose to such new enterprise or third-party the terms of this Section 1, and shall cause such enterprise or third-party to maintain such information in confidence. Selling Parties further agree and authorize the Company to notify others, including customers of the Company and any such future enterprise or third-party to which either Zenith or Seller may become a partner, member, owner or investor, of the terms of this Section 1 and of their obligations hereunder.
(d) Selling Parties hereby agree that the period of time in which this Section 1 is in effect shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of any breach of this Section 1(a) by Selling Parties.
(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Selling Parties or their affiliates or associates, any of their directors, officers or employees, or any of their representatives from investing in stocks, bonds, or other securities of any entity that engages in a Competing Business, provided, however, that in the case of capital stock, such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market or registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and such investment does not exceed, in the case of any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, three percent of the issued and outstanding voting power at the time of such investment. In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent any officer or director of the Selling Parties or their affiliates or associates from serving as a director or trustee of any Competing Business.
2. Protection of Information. Selling Parties recognize and acknowledge that the Company's trade secrets and all other confidential and proprietary information of a business, financial or other nature, including without limitation, proprietary information of the Company, as it exists from time to time (collectively, ""Confidential Information""), are valuable and unique assets of the Company and therefore agree that, during the Restriction Period, except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, or the rules of any exchange on which any securities of Zenith are or will be listed, they will not, and will use their best efforts to ensure that their directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents and consultants do not, disclose any Confidential Information concerning the Company and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates, to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, for any reason whatsoever, unless previously authorized in writing to do so by Meritage. It is understood that Confidential Information shall not include any information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by Selling Parties or that is disclosed by Selling Parties in accordance with the terms of a prior written consent of Meritage. For the purpose of enforcing this provision, the Company may resort to any remedy available to it under the law. In the event that any Selling Party is requested pursuant to, or required by, Applicable Laws, regulation or rules of any securities exchange or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Company, the Selling Parties agree that they shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Company to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, to consult with the Selling Parties with respect to the Company taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process, or to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Section 2. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Company waives compliance with the terms of this Section 2, Selling Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to disclose only that portion of any Confidential Information which Selling Parties are advised by counsel is legally required and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information so disclosed shall be accorded confidential treatment in accordance with this Section 2.
3. Severability. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Restriction Period is unenforceable, the Restriction Period shall mean *. Additionally, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, then such provision will be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification will render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.
4. Waiver. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.
5. Injunctive Relief. Selling Parties acknowledge and agree that Meritage and the Company would be irreparably harmed by any violation of Selling Parties' obligations under Sections 1 and 2 hereof and that, in addition to all other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, the Company will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or enjoin any such violation.
6. Assignment by Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Zenith, Seller, Meritage or the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon such consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the terms ""Zenith,"" ""Seller,"" ""Meritage"" and ""Company,"" respectively, as used herein shall mean such other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. For purposes of Sections 1 and 2 hereof, the term ""Company"" shall mean all joint ventures (50% or more owned by Company), subsidiaries and parent companies of Company (whether corporate, partnership or other form), including the subsidiary that operates the Business as a division of Meritage Corporation.
7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the complete agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior written, or prior or contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements between the parties that may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by Meritage and Selling Parties.
8. Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions relating to its validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Nevada.
9. Notice. All notices, consents, and other communications hereunder will be in writing and deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand, (b) sent by telecopier (with receipt confirmed), or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by Express Mail, Federal Express, or other express delivery service (with delivery confirmation), in each case to the appropriate addresses and telecopier numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and telecopier numbers as a party may designate as to itself by notice to the other):

Seller also acknowledges that Purchasers and Parent have a reasonable present and future expectation of continuing the Business within the Territory.
2.02 CONFIDENTIALITY AND TRADE SECRETS.
(a) Seller acknowledges and agrees that as the owner of the Division it has created substantial confidential information used in and concerning the business and has been afforded an unique opportunity to acquire confidential information concerning the Business and that the misappropriation or disclosure of such confidential information would cause irreparable harm to Purchasers and Parent. Seller acknowledges that such confidential information includes, without limitation, financial information concerning the Business, the names and addresses of actual and potential customers of the Business, studies of prospective market areas for the Business, supply sources of the Business, products of the Business, technical data concerning the Business, ideas of the Business, processes of the Business, financial matters concerning the Business, and trade secrets of the Business, such information collectively being referred to as the ""Confidential Information."" For purposes of this Agreement ""trade secrets"" means any information that derives independent value from being secret. Confidential Information shall not include any information or documents that (i) are or become publicly available without breach of this Section 2.02, (ii) Seller receives from any third party who, to the best of Seller's knowledge upon reasonable inquiry, is not breaching an obligation of confidence with Purchasers or Parent (including such an obligation under an agreement assigned to Purchasers pursuant to the Asset Sale Agreement) or without an accompanying obligation of confidence, or (iii) is required to be released by law. In the event that Seller is requested in any court or governmental proceeding to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall give Purchasers and Parent prompt notice of such request, such that Purchasers or Parent may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief, and in any such proceeding Seller will disclose only so much of the Confidential Information as is required to be disclosed.
(b) Seller will keep confidential and will not for a period of three (3) years after the execution of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, divulge to anyone, use or otherwise appropriate any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose whatsoever except to authorized representatives of Purchasers or the Parent.
(c) With respect to any trade secrets included in the Confidential Information, Seller also agrees not to use or disclose any of such trade secrets at any time until such trade secrets become generally available to the public by independent discovery or development and publication through no fault of Seller. Seller acknowledges and agrees that these prohibitions against disclosure of Confidential Information are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that Purchasers or Parent may have available pursuant to the laws of any jurisdiction or at common law to prevent disclosure of trade secrets or proprietary information, and the enforcement by Purchasers or Parent of any of their rights and remedies pursuant to this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or available remedies they may possess in law or equity absent this Agreement.
2.03 NON-COMPETITION. Seller agrees that for a period of three (3) years following the execution of this Agreement, it will not, without Purchasers' prior written consent, Directly or Indirectly Compete with Purchasers in the Business within the Territory.
2.04 NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-INTERFERENCE. Seller agrees that for a period of one (1) year after the execution of this Agreement, it will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, partnership, firm or corporation hire any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date, or request or induce any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date to terminate his or her employment and accept employment with another entity.
2.05 REMEDIES. Seller acknowledges that any violation of this Article II will cause irreparable harm to Purchasers and Parent and that damages are not an adequate remedy. Seller, therefore, agrees that Purchasers and Parent shall be entitled to an injunction, without the necessity of posting any bond, enjoining, prohibiting, and restraining Seller from the continuance of any such violation, in addition to any monetary recovery that might be available to Purchasers and Parent by reason of a violation of this Agreement and any other remedies at law or in equity, including without limitation specific performance.
2.06 INDEPENDENT. The covenants set forth in the foregoing Sections of Article II are and shall be deemed and construed as separate and independent covenants. Should any part or provision of such covenants be held invalid, void, or unenforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision thereof. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any portion of Section 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 or 2.04 is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction because its duration, the Territory, and/or the Business or any definition or restriction are invalid or unreasonable in scope, such duration, Territory, and/or Business or any definition or restriction, as the case may be, shall be redefined by consideration of the reasonable concerns and needs of Purchasers such that the intent of Purchasers, the Company and Seller, in agreeing to Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 and 2.04, will not be impaired and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent of the applicable laws.
ARTICLE III

From and after any such assignment by Purchasers or Parent, the term ""Purchasers"" or ""Parent,"" as the case may be, shall mean such assignee, and such assignee may enforce any of the rights of Purchasers or Parent under this Agreement as if it were the original party hereto.

United Dominion Industries

301 South College Street
Charlotte, NC 28202-6039
Dear Mr. Bearse:
You have requested information regarding lmo Industries Inc. (the ""Company"", ""us"" or ""we"") in connection with your consideration of a possible negotiated transaction with the Company (a ""Possible Transaction""). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:
CONFIDENTIALITY OF EVALUATION MATERIALS
You and your representatives (as defined herein) will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (""CSFB""), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the ""Evaluation Materials""). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.
The term ""Evaluation Materials"" includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as ""confidential"". The term ""Evaluation Materials"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you or your representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not to your knowledge prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you.
USE OF EVALUATION MATERIALS
You and your representatives will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential and will not disclose the Evaluation Materials, in any manner, in whole or in part; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, ""your representatives"") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you and shall agree to treat such information confidentially in accordance with this Agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. You will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your representatives.
In the event that you or any of your representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company (at the Company's expense) in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) you shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by you or your representatives not permitted by this Agreement.
NON-DISCLOSURE
The disclosure of your possible interest in negotiating a transaction with the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that you have entered into this Agreement, that Evaluation Materials have been made available or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof. The term ""person"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.
RETURN OF DOCUMENTS
Upon the Company's request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Materials, you and your representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
NO UNAUTHORIZED CONTACT OR SOLICITATION
During the course of your evaluation, you agree that all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to CSFB or employees or representatives of the Company specified by CSFB.
Without the Company's prior written consent, the persons who are involved in the possible transaction will not for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment any person who is now employed by the Company (or whose activities are dedicated to the Company) in an executive or management level position or otherwise considered by the Company to be a key employee.
STANDSTILL
You agree that until one year from the date of this Agreement, you will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a ""group"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. Except as provided above, you also agree during such period not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives) to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.
NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
Although the Company and CSFB have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of your investigation, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, CSFB or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, CSFB or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to you or any other person resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by you or any of your representatives, except as may be set forth in a definitive sale agreement. Only those representations or warranties that are made in a definitive agreement relating to the Company (""Sale Agreement"") when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.
You also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto. You also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and you with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term ""Sale Agreement"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by you.
You further understand and agree that (i) the Company and CSFB shall be free to conduct the process regarding a transaction involving the Company as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a Sale Agreement without prior notice to you or to any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such sale may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person and (iii) you shall not have any claims whatsoever against the Company, CSFB or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, owners, affiliates, agents or representatives arising out of or relating to a transaction involving the Company (other than those as against the parties to a Sale Agreement with you in accordance with the terms thereof).
LEGAL REMEDY
You understand and agree that the Company would be irreparably injured and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives and that the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.
You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and you agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), and further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to your address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against you in any such court. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.
This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.
This Agreement and all of your obligations hereunder shall expire five years after the date hereof.
If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.
Very truly yours,

In order to pursue a potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship, Kaplan and Company recognize that there is a need to disclose to each other certain confidential information of each party to be used solely for the purpose of evaluating this opportunity.
Each party intends to protect such confidential information of the other party from unauthorized use and disclosure. In consideration of the disclosures, the parties hereby agree as follows:
1. This Agreement shall apply to: (a) confidential or proprietary exchanged material and information (in written, taped or computerized form or format) that is clearly and prominently marked ""Proprietary or ""Confidential"" or that is not so marked but, by its nature, is such that it reasonably should be held in confidence, including, but not limited to, technical, developmental, marketing, editorial, sales, operating, performance, cost, know-how, computer programming techniques, and any new or planned programs and services; (b) the existence and substance of oral and written communications between the parties about the potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship; and (c) the existence of the discussions between Company and Kaplan about the potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship.

3. The parties may disclose the Confidential Information to their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, subsidiaries and affiliates working in connection with the purpose for which the Confidential Information is disclosed but only to the extent necessary to carry out that purpose and subject to all requirements of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement. The party receiving the Confidential Information (the ""Receiving Party"") may also disclose Confidential Information to a third party pursuant to paragraph 4(g) below and subject to the notice provision set forth therein.

Receiving Party furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be so disclosed.
5. The Receiving Party shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise analyze, restructure and/or copy or in any way recreate in whole or in part any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.

Subject only to the Receiving Party's limited use of the Confidential Information for the purpose set forth above in this Agreement, the Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, and the Receiving Party shall not violate any of the Disclosing Party's intellectual property or other rights in or to the Confidential Information.

 In connection with a potential transaction (the ""Transaction"") between Holdings and Big Sky, Big Sky has and will furnish to Holdings certain information (""Information"") including but not limited to financial, marketing and operational information, and such other information necessary for Holdings to evaluate the transaction. The term ""Information"" shall mean all information that Big Sky has furnished or is furnishing to Holdings, whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement, whether tangible or intangible and in whatever form or medium provided, as well as all information generated by Holdings or by its Representatives, as defined below, that contains, reflects or is derived from the furnished information.
 In consideration of Big Sky's disclosure to Holdings of the Information, Holdings agrees that it will keep the Information confidential and that the Information will not, without the prior written consent of Big Sky, be disclosed by Holdings or by its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (collectively, ""Representatives""), in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and shall not be used by Holdings or by its Representatives, other than in connection with evaluating the Transaction. Moreover, Big Sky agrees to transmit the Information only to such of its Representatives who need to know the Information for the sole purpose of assisting Holdings in evaluating the Transaction and who are informed of this Agreement.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above restrictions shall not apply to the following:
(i) Information that is publicly available at the time of disclosure (through no act of Holdings of any of its Representatives);
(ii) Information that is disclosed to Holdings by a third party that did not disclose it in violation of a duty of confidentiality;
(iii) Information that was known to Holdings before such Information was provided to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of Big Sky;
(iv) disclosures that are required to be made by Holdings or any of its Representatives under legal process by subpoena or other court order or other applicable laws or regulations (provided, however, that Holdings makes reasonable efforts to provide copies of such Information to, or informs Big Sky before disclosure), or that are requested by Big Sky.
 Without the prior written consent of Big Sky, neither Holdings nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the fact that Holdings has received any Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction, including the status thereof. Likewise, without the prior written consent of Holdings, neither Big Sky nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the fact that Holdings has received any Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction, including the status thereof.

Holdings agrees that neither Big Sky nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to it or to any of its Representatives resulting from the provision or use of the Information.
 Each party acknowledges that it has been informed that the other party is a publicly-traded corporation and that the Information and the Transaction must be secured from any use or dissemination until such time as proper disclosure can be provided to shareholders and the securities markets in order to protect the interests of shareholders of each party and so that the rules and statutes pertaining to information about and trading in publicly held securities can be followed.

 Each party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement by it, the other would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, each party shall be entitled to an injunction of injunctions (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement, and that neither party nor any of its Representatives will oppose the granting of such relief.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
THIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) between Universal Hospital Services, Inc. (“UHS”) and Emergent Group, Inc. (“Company”), is effective October 26, 2010.
Whereas, UHS and Company intend to engage in confidential discussions for the purpose of evaluating a potential business transaction between UHS and Company (“Business Transaction”), and as part of the Business Transaction, each party anticipates that it will disclose to the other party certain information that its deems confidential and/or proprietary.
Now, therefore, to assure the confidentiality of the parties’ confidential information and to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of this information, UHS and Company agree as follows:
1. Confidential Information Defined. The term “Confidential Information” means all confidential and proprietary information belonging to one party (the “Disclosing Party”) that is revealed to the other party (the “Receiving Party”) during the Disclosure Period, which begins on the effective date and ends April 26, 2011. Confidential Information, regardless of the form in which it appears, may include, without limitation, information about customers, business and marketing plans, financial data, expertise of employees, forecasts and strategies that is related to the business of the Disclosing Party and is of the type of information that would reasonably be deemed to be confidential.
2. Use Restriction. The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information for the sole purpose of evaluating and negotiating the Business Transaction.
3. Disclosure Restrictions and Exceptions. The Receiving Party will disclose Confidential Information only to its employees and to its representative whose participation is necessary or helpful to evaluate and advance to the Business Transaction and who have agreed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party will limit the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Receiving Party is not prohibited from disclosing Confidential Information it is legally compelled to disclose (by deposition, subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order or otherwise), provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of any such required disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained and the Disclosing Party has not waived compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Party is advised by opinion of counsel it is legally required to furnish and will exercise reasonable efforts to limit the scope and content of such disclosure and obtain confidential treatment of such Confidential Information, Furthermore, the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement do not apply with respect to any Confidential Information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than from the improper action of the Receiving Party, (b) is developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, (c) was in the Receiving Party’s possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (d) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party.
4. Nondisclosure of Possible Business Transaction. Except as permitted by the previous paragraph, neither the Receiving Party nor the Receiving Party’s representatives will disclose to any person the fact that the Confidential information has been made available to the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s representatives or that the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party’s representatives have inspected any portion of the Confidential Information.
5. Waiver. The failure of a party to insist, in one or more instances, upon performance of any of the provisions or conditions of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any other provision or condition of this Agreement, and no present waiver will be construed as a future waiver of such provision or condition.
6. Remedies. Because of the unique and proprietary nature of Confidential Information, it is understood and agreed that remedies at law for a breach by the Receiving Party of its obligations under this Agreement may be inadequate and that in the event of such breach or threatened breach the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance. The remedies set forth in this Section are in addition to any other remedies available for any such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the breaching party.
7. Assignment. This Agreement is not assignable by either party without the prior express written consent of the other, except that UHS may assign this Agreement to an affiliate or to a successor in interest to which the business relates.
8. Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement states the entire understanding of the parties regarding the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and it cannot be altered or amended without a writing signed by both parties. This Agreement will not be construed to create any obligation on the part of either party to retain the other party’s services or to compensate the other party in any manner.
9. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all documents or other materials furnished by the Disclosing Party constituting Confidential Information, together with all copies thereof in the possession, custody or control of the Receiving Party, without retaining any copies. Any destruction must be confirmed by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Receiving Party is not required to return or destroy computer files stored in the ordinary course of its business as a result of automated back-up procedures (subject, however, to the confidentiality restrictions set forth herein).
10. Term. The Receiving Party’s obligations imposed pursuant to this Agreement will continue for two years from the date hereof. ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:

Scope of Confidential Information
1. “Confidential Information” means, for each party, whether in oral, written or in electronic form:
(i) any information, data, intellectual property (including trade secrets), facts and financial information relating to the existing or proposed business, products, customers or services of such party and its affiliates that are treated as confidential by it, or ought to be considered confidential from their nature or the circumstances surrounding their disclosure; (ii) the existence of, and either party's potential participation in, the Proposed Transaction (including the contents and details of any discussions and negotiations of the terms, conditions and other matters with respect thereto); and (iii) any reports, analyses, forecasts, memoranda, compilations, studies, notes or summaries of such information, or other written or electronic documents prepared by, or on behalf of or for the Recipient or affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, members or other equity holders, agents or advisors (“Representatives”) of the Recipient, to the extent that they use, contain, relate to, reflect, or are derived from such information (collectively, “Derivative Confidential Information”).
2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information which would otherwise be considered “Confidential Information”, is not subject to the terms of this Agreement if such information is:
(a) in the public domain other than as a consequence of a breach of the obligations contained in this Agreement or other duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information;
(b) known by the party receiving the Confidential Information (the “Recipient”) prior to the disclosure of the Confidential Information by the disclosing party (the “Disclosing Party”) without any other obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party;

(d) received by the Recipient from a third party who is not subject to obligations similar to the obligations contained in this Agreement, including any duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information.
Obligation to Maintain Confidentiality
3. The Recipient will keep, and will cause its Representatives to keep, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party confidential. The Recipient will not disclose the Confidential Information or use or permit the Confidential Information to be disclosed or used, to or by any person except Recipient’s Representatives, in each case, who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. In any such case Confidential Information will be disclosed only to those Representatives with a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of the Proposed Transaction, and (iv) only so much of the Confidential Information as is necessary for a particular individual to perform his or her function will be disclosed to that individual. Under no circumstances shall the Recipient or its Representatives use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose other than evaluating and negotiating the Proposed Transaction. In any event, the Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.
4. The Recipient agrees to take all reasonable steps (including those steps that the Recipient takes to protect its own information, data or other tangible or intangible property that it regards as confidential) to ensure the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
5. Except as provided in Section 3, the Recipient will not, without the consent of the Disclosing Party, (i) disclose to any person the fact that it has obtained the Confidential Information, or (ii) make any disclosure respecting any Proposed Transaction between the parties to any third party, including, without limitation, any suppliers, customers or clients of each party.
6. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may disclose to other potential parties for a Proposed Transaction that it is considering or negotiating a Proposed transaction and the terms and conditions thereof, but may not disclose the involvement of the Company or any other information identifying the involvement of the Company.
7. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Representatives may disclose Confidential Information to the extent necessary to defend any litigation claim or cause of action brought against it by the other party relating to the Proposed Transaction or this Agreement; provided that the Disclosing Party agrees to use (and to cause its applicable Representatives to use) reasonable efforts, at the other party's expense, to obtain assurances that any such disclosed Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.
8. If the Recipient, or anyone else to whom Confidential Information is provided as permitted by this Agreement, receives notice indicating that it may or will be legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, Recipient will make a reasonable effort to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek, at its expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this Agreement. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained for whatever reason, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with this Agreement, the compelled person will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which Recipient is informed by advice of its counsel that it is required to disclose.
Ownership of Confidential Information
9. All right, title and interest in and to a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and the Confidential Information will be held in trust and confidence by the Recipient and its Representatives. No interest, license or any right respecting the Confidential Information, other than expressly set out in this Agreement, is granted to the Recipient under this Agreement by implication or otherwise.
10. All written, electronic or oral information that contains any part of a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information (including any Derivative Confidential Information) will remain the property of the Disclosing Party.
Return or Destruction of Confidential Information
11. The Recipient will, within five business days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, confirm that it has destroyed the original provided to Recipient (and all copies made by it) any documents (in whatever form or medium) provided, or made available for review by, the Disclosing Party (including any Derivative Confidential Information). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the parties agree that destruction will not be made of (i) any electronic copy of any Confidential Information that was created pursuant to the standard electronic backup and archival procedures of the Recipient if (x) personnel of the Recipient whose functions are not primarily internal information technology in nature do not have access to such retained copies and (y) personnel of the Recipient whose functions are primarily internal information technology in nature have access to such copies only as reasonably necessary for the performance of their internal information technology duties (e.g., for purposes of system recovery). The parties further agree that they will continue to treat as confidential in accordance with the Agreement, any Confidential Information retained pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 11.
No Liability Regarding Confidential Information
12. The Recipient acknowledges that (i) the Disclosing Party is not obligated to provide any information pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the Confidential Information is being given to it without liability on the part of the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, and (iii) no representation or warranty with respect to the Confidential Information is made by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives. The Recipient agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or its Representatives.
General
13. The Recipient agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives, and that any court having competent jurisdiction may enter a preliminary and/or permanent restraining order, injunction or order for specific performance, without posting any bond, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity available to the Disclosing Party.
14. This Agreement will terminate on the first anniversary of the date hereof.
15.

16. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement is distinct and severable and a declaration of invalidity or unenforceability of any provision by a court of competent jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to its subject matter. No amendment or waiver of this Agreement will be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound.
17. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.
18. This Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to be applicable.
19. Each of the parties hereto expressly agree that they will not, and will not permit any of its Representatives to directly or indirectly, hire an employee of the other party, or solicit or induce any employee of the other party to leave such employee’s position with the other party, for a period of one year. However, this paragraph shall not prohibit the Potential Acquiror or any of its affiliates from soliciting or hiring an employee who responds to a general solicitation of employment.
20. To the extent that any Confidential Information includes materials subject to the attorney-client privilege or similar privileges or protections, such disclosure is inadvertent and the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party.
21. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by PDF) with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an original of this Agreement.
22. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.

Verizon Communications Inc.
140 West Street
New York, New York 10007
Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have indicated an interest in evaluating a potential acquisition (the “Transaction”) of Terremark Worldwide, Inc. (the “Company”). In evaluating the Transaction, you have requested certain information regarding the Company and the Transaction from the Company. As a condition to your receipt of such information, you agree to treat any information concerning the Transaction or the Company which is furnished to you in connection with evaluating the Transaction (all such information, collectively, the “Confidential Information”) in accordance with the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement (this “Agreement”) and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions herein set forth.
1. You hereby agree that the Confidential Information will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and implementing the Transaction and that such information will be kept confidential by you; provided that any such information may be disclosed to your officers, directors, employees, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, consultants, other agents or representatives and financing sources (such Persons hereinafter collectively being referred to as your “Representatives” who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating and implementing the Transaction, have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and have been advised that such information is to be kept confidential, and provided, further, that such officers, directors, employees, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, consultants, other agents or representatives and financing sources shall not be deemed to be your Representatives unless (but solely to the extent that) you furnish Confidential Information to them. You agree you will be liable for any breaches of the terms of this Agreement by such Representatives.
You and the Company also each agree, on behalf of itself, its affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, disclose to any Person the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to you, that discussions or negotiations have taken place or are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof.
2. The term “Confidential Information” does not include any information which (a) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives in breach of this Agreement), (b) was available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company, (c) becomes available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known by you or your Representatives (as applicable) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company, or is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to you or your Representatives (as applicable), or (d) is or was independently developed by you or your Representatives without reference to, incorporation of, or other use of any Confidential Information.
3. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and our current discussions, the Company may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information and you and the Company may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of our discussions or by any breach of this Agreement by you, the Company or the Representatives of you and the Company. Without prejudice to other rights and remedies otherwise available, you and the Company therefore agree that the other party hereto shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other party hereto or the Representatives of the other party hereto.
4. In the event you or any of your Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand, order or similar process) to disclose any of the contents of the Confidential Information, or you or the Company or any of the respective Representatives of you or the Company become so legally compelled to disclose either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction between the Company and you, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof, the Company and you each agrees that each party and its respective Representatives may do so without liability, but each party hereto also agrees (i) to promptly notify the other party prior to any such disclosure to the extent practicable and legally permissible and (ii) to cooperate with the other party in any attempt it may make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Confidential Information.
5. The Company may elect at any time to terminate further access by you to the Confidential Information. Following any written request by the Company, you agree, at the Company’s election, to either promptly redeliver to the Company or destroy all written Confidential Information in your possession or your Representatives’ possession, and you and your Representatives will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material. You further agree that all documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by you or your Representatives based on the Confidential Information shall be destroyed, and you shall delete, to the extent reasonably practicable, all Confidential Information from any computer or other electronic device. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such destruction or deletion shall be
required where prohibited by law, regulation, regulatory process or proceeding, or stock exchange regulation, or where the Confidential Information is part of the record of proceedings of your Board of Directors; provided, that any such Confidential Information so retained shall continue to be held confidential in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
6. You and the Company also agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into between the Company and you with respect to the Transaction, neither the Company nor you will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Nothing contained in any discussions between you and the Company or in any Confidential Information shall be deemed to constitute a representation or warranty. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.
7. You agree that certain Confidential Information may be deemed material non-public information under applicable securities laws. Without limitation of the other restrictions on use or transfer of Confidential Information described herein, you agree that while such information remains non-public, you will not engage, and will direct your Representatives not to engage, in any transactions in the securities of the Company in a manner which would constitute a violation of such laws.
8.

9, Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of a definitive agreement, if any, with respect to the Transaction and without prejudice thereto, each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that none of the other party or any of such other party’s respective Representatives and none of the respective officers, directors, partners, shareholders, members, employees, agents or persons in control of such other party’s Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty to such party, such party’s Representatives or to any other person as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information furnished by or on behalf of such party, and each party hereto hereby further acknowledges and agrees that none of such persons shall have any liability to the other party or any of such other party’s Representatives relating to or arising from or in connection with such other party’s use or the use by such other party’s Representatives of any Confidential Information furnished by or on behalf of such party to such other party or its respective Representatives or for any inaccuracies contained therein or any omissions therefrom. Each party hereto also acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information furnished to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of the other party and that such party shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties as may be made to it and contained expressly in any definitive agreement with respect to the Transaction, to the extent in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in any such definitive agreement.
10. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consents to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America located in the State of New York for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement (and irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to commence any such action, suit, or proceeding except in such courts), (b) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such courts and (c) waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
11 The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding solely upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. The Company agrees that you may assign all rights, powers, privileges, and obligations under this Agreement with respect to any or all of the proposed Transaction to any of your affiliates.
12. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto and may be modified only by a separate written agreement executed by you and the Company expressly modifying this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes and cancels any and all prior agreements between the parties hereto, express or implied, relating to the Transaction; provided that the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of November 13, 2009 between the parties hereto shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the matters contemplated thereby.
13.

MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT
 This Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this ""Agreement"") is made as of September 6, 2001 between EarthLink, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""EarthLink""), and CIDCO, Incorporated., a Delaware corporation (""CIDCO""). EarthLink and CIDCO are sometimes referred to herein individually as a ""Party"" and collectively as the ""Parties.""
 1. Purpose. EarthLink and CIDCO wish to have discussions relating to a potential transaction (the ""Transaction"") between EarthLink (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders) and CIDCO (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders). In the course of such discussions, each Party expects to make available to the other Party and its Representatives (as defined herein) Evaluation Material (as defined herein) concerning the businesses, financial condition, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, and prospects of such Party. As a condition to making such information available, each Party is entering this Agreement and agrees that all Evaluation Material received by it or its Representatives from the other Party or any of its Representatives shall be treated in accordance with this Agreement.
 2. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) the term ""Receiving Party"" means the Party receiving Evaluation Material; (ii) the term ""Furnishing Party"" means the Party providing Evaluation Material or causing Evaluation Material to be provided; (iii) the term ""Representatives"" means the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors engaged in connection with the review and evaluation of the Transaction) of the specified Party; and (iv) the term ""Evaluation Material"" means all proprietary and confidential information concerning the Furnishing Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in verbal, visual, written, electronic or other form, which is made available by the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Primary Evaluation Material""), together, in each case, with all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, studies, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based in whole or in part thereon prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (""Derivative Evaluation Material""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term ""Evaluation Material"" shall not include, and the Parties' obligations herein (other than their obligations under paragraph 6 of this Agreement) shall not extend to, information which (a) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Furnishing Party; (b) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Evaluation Material; (c) is now or hereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party's Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives and such source is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party following reasonable inquiry, under any obligation to the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to keep such information confidential; or (e) is transmitted by or on behalf of the Furnishing Party after receiving written notification from the Receiving Party of the termination of discussions relating to the Transaction or written instructions from the Receiving Party not to furnish any further Evaluation Material.
 3. Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material.
 (a) Confidentiality of Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material (i) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and considering the Transaction; (ii) shall be kept strictly confidential by the Receiving Party; and (iii) shall be provided by the Receiving Party solely to those of its Representatives to whom disclosure is reasonably required to facilitate the Receiving Party's evaluation or consideration of the Transaction, it being the intention of the Parties to restrict the dissemination of Evaluation Material to as small a working group as practicable. The Parties agree that all Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Furnishing Party. Before providing access to Evaluation Material to any Representative, the Receiving Party shall inform such Representative of the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and shall advise such Representative that, by accepting possession of or access to such information, such Representative is agreeing to be bound by this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.
 (b) Compulsory Disclosure of Evaluation Material. If the Receiving Party or its Representatives are requested or required in any judicial, arbital or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or otherwise), or the Receiving Party is so requested or required to disclose any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under paragraph (3)(c) of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall give the Furnishing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Furnishing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall reasonably cooperate with the Furnishing Party in seeking such an order. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the opinion of the Receiving Party's or (in the case of disclosure requested or required of a Representative, such Representative's) outside counsel or General Counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall use all requisite reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material to the extent such assurances are available. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Receiving Party may disclose Evaluation Material under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b) without liability hereunder.
 (c) Other Public Disclosure. Except (i) for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party consistent with advice of counsel, for the disclosing Party not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or order, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall:
 (x) make any disclosure (and each Party shall direct its Representatives not to make any disclosure) to any person of (A) the fact that discussions, negotiations or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, or the fact that either Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or (C) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any proposed Transaction, including the status of the discussions or negotiations related thereto, or
 (y) make any public statement concerning a proposed Transaction.
 (d) Notice. If either Party proposes to make any disclosure in reliance on clause (i) above, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party with the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and shall in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the other Party concerning the nature and scope of the information it proposes to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may make such public announcement or public statement if in the opinion of such Party's outside counsel or General Counsel, such public announcement or public statement is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or of any rule or regulation of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system on which such Party's securities are listed or trade. In such event, the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to give advance notice to the other Party and to consult with the other Party on the timing and content of any such public announcement or public statement.
 (e) Certain Securities Law Restrictions. Each Party acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may contain material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party. Each Party further acknowledges its awareness of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on persons in possession of material nonpublic information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either Party that any Evaluation Material in fact contains material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party.
 (f) Contact with Employees and Representatives. Neither Party shall communicate with any employee of the other Party regarding the Transaction or disclose any Evaluation Material to any employee or Representative of the other Party, other than the employees and Representatives named on the working group lists provided by the Parties from time to time.
 (g) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party will be restricted from using the information contained in the Evaluation Material that is retained in the minds of Representatives who have had access to the other Party's Evaluation Material, unless such use shall infringe on any of such Party's patent rights, trademark rights or copyright rights.
 4. Accuracy of Evaluation Material; No Representations or Warranties. Each Party acknowledges and agrees (a) that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by either Party or any of its respective Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (b) that the Parties shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties (if any) that may be made in a definitive written agreement for the Transaction, signed and delivered by both Parties, and then only to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided therein.
 5. No Solicitation. For a period of one year subsequent to the termination of discussions regarding a Transaction, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by the other Party (or any of its subsidiaries) with whom the hiring Party first has contact, or who first becomes known to the hiring Party, in the course of the Parties' discussions and due diligence with respect to the proposed Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either Party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring Party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring Party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring Party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other Party or (iii) is identified by a third party executive search firm or employment agency without any assistance from such Party.
 6. Return and Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time after termination of discussions by either Party with respect to the Transaction, upon the request of the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly (and in no event later than five business days after such request) (a) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the Furnishing Party all copies of all Primary Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is in a visual or written format and erase or destroy all copies of all such Primary Evaluation Material which is stored in electronic format, and (b) destroy or cause to be destroyed all Derivative Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Nothing herein shall obligate the Receiving Party to provide any Derivative Evaluation Material to the Furnishing Party. Notwithstanding the return, destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material hereunder, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
 7. Remedies. Each Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this Agreement by it or any of its Representatives, and that in addition to all other remedies which either Party may have, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that either Party should institute proceedings to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all expenses relating to the enforcement of this Agreement, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies.
 8. Communications. CIDCO recognizes EarthLink will incur substantial expenses in conducting a due diligence investigation of CIDCO, and in consideration for EarthLink's doing so, CIDCO agrees to cease and terminate immediately, and to cause its Representatives to cease and terminate immediately, any negotiations (other than with EarthLink and its Representatives) with respect to any proposals relating to any business combination, tender offer or acquisition transaction involving the acquisition by any third party of all or any portion of the stock or assets of CIDCO (any such proposal being a ""Third-Party Offer"" and any such acquisition being a ""Third-Party Acquisition""). In addition, CIDCO agrees that from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date a definitive agreement for EarthLink's acquisition of CIDCO is executed, or (b) October 31, 2001 (as the same may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties, the ""Restricted Period""), CIDCO will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its Representatives, to directly or indirectly, solicit, consider or encourage any inquiries or proposals for (or which may reasonably be expected to lead to) any Third-Party Offer, or engage in discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications with or provide any information to, or otherwise assist or cooperate with any person, entity or group in connection with any Third-Party Offer. Immediately upon receipt of any Third-Party Offer or related inquiry during such period, CIDCO agrees to inform EarthLink of the fact of such Third-Party Offer or related inquiry, including, among other things, the identity of the third-party making such offer or inquiry. Without limiting its application to the entirety of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, including without limitation EarthLink's remedies of specific performance and injunction, shall be specifically applicable to violations of this first paragraph of Section 8.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 8 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of CIDCO from, only to the minimum extent required, complying with the mandatory disclosure requirements of Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with regard to an unsolicited Third-Party Offer, pursuant to advice of outside legal counsel, provided, that any recommendation by the Board of Directors other than to recommend rejection of such offer shall be considered an immediate breach of this Section 8.
 In consideration of the efforts and resources to be expended by EarthLink in its due diligence investigation of CIDCO and related matters, CIDCO agrees that in the event that it violates any provision of the first or second paragraphs of this Section 8 in any manner during the Restricted Period, CIDCO shall become liable to pay, and shall immediately pay, to EarthLink One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) plus the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of EarthLink including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other professional charges incurred by EarthLink in connection with the proposed Transaction. The parties hereby agree that EarthLink would be substantially harmed as a result of such a violation of this Section 8, that the specific damages incurred by EarthLink would be difficult of determination, and that this amount constitutes a reasonable estimate of such damages to be incurred by EarthLink and shall constitute reasonable liquidated damages for a breach of this Section 8.
 9. Miscellaneous.
 (a) No License. Neither Party grants a license, by implication or otherwise, under any of its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to the Receiving Party. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other Party's Evaluation Material. The Furnishing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently or in the future develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Material. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for it products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Evaluation Material, provided that
the Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.
 (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the confidentiality of their discussions, negotiations and investigations concerning a Transaction.
 (c) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Parties.
 (d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement unless the enforcement of such provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.
 (e) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement to consummate a Transaction, to conduct or continue negotiations with respect to a Transaction, or to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, and neither Party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or by virtue of any other written or oral expression by the Parties' respective Representatives unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction is executed and delivered by both Parties, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Both Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not to provide Evaluation Material to the Receiving Party under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
In connection with a potential transaction (“Proposed Transaction”) between 3M Company (“Interested Party” or “Receiving Party”), and Cogent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Company” or “Disclosing Party”), the parties wish to protect and preserve the confidential and/or proprietary nature of certain information and materials of the Company that may be disclosed or made available to the Interested Party or its Representatives (as defined below) in connection with certain discussions, negotiations or dealings between the parties relating to the Proposed Transaction.
In consideration of the foregoing and the rights and obligations set forth herein, both parties hereby agree as of July 31, 2008 (the “Effective Date”):
1. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND OTHER DEFINITIONS.
1.1 “Proprietary Information” means any and all information and material disclosed by Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives in connection with the Proposed Transaction or in the course of the parties’ evaluation and negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, together with all communications, data, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, records, notes, lists, financial statements or other materials or information prepared by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that contain or otherwise reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party or that reflect the review of, interest in, or evaluation of all or any portion of the Proposed Transaction or Disclosing Party’s business (collectively, “Derived Information”), whether tangible or intangible, furnished or prepared in writing or in oral, graphic, electronic or any other form or manner. In addition, Proprietary Information shall include (x) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Proposed Transaction or that Interested Party has made or may make an offer to acquire Company’s stock or assets or that any Proprietary Information has been shared between the parties and their respective Representatives in connection therewith, (y) the proposed terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction (including any financial terms and conditions) and the status thereof, and (z) the existence, context, and scope of this Agreement.
Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or other action or inaction by Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement (including any disclosure or other action or inaction by Representatives of Receiving Party that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if undertaken by Receiving Party itself); (ii) is or becomes known or avai1able to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than Disclosing Party or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives) that, to the best of the knowledge of Receiving Party, is not prohibited from disclosing such Proprietary Information to Receiving Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (iii) is or was independently developed by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without violation of any obligation under this Agreement.
1.2 “Representatives” means as to any person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, accountants and their respective Representatives).
1.3 “person” shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.
2. NON-DISCLOSURE AND LIMITED USE.
2.1 Non-Disclosure. Without the written consent of Disclosing Party and except as otherwise required by applicable law, Receiving Party shall keep, and shall cause its Representatives to keep, all Proprietary Information confidential and shall not disclose or reveal, and shall cause its Representatives not to disclose or reveal, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information to any person, other than to its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction and who are bound by restrictions regarding the disclosure and use of such Proprietary Information (either contractual, legal or fiduciary) owed to Company, Interested Party or any their respective Representatives that are comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement. Each party shall inform all of its respective Representatives and shall cause its respective Representatives to inform their Representatives who receive Proprietary Information hereunder of the confidential nature of such information and the Proposed Transaction, as well as the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction or in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.
2.2 Degree of Care. Receiving Party shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential proprietary information of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer (except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding a contractual obligation to the contrary) any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof, or determine or attempt to determine any source code, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof. Receiving Party shall not use Proprietary Information for any purpose or in any manner that would constitute a violation of any laws or regulations, including without limitation the export control laws of the United States.
2.3 Designated Representatives. Neither Interested Party nor its Representatives shall initiate or maintain contact with any officer, director, stockholder, employee or agent of Company or its subsidiaries regarding the Proposed Transaction, except with the express consent of Company. All (i) communications regarding the Proposed Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for on-site access or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to the Representatives designated by the Company.
2.4 Compelled Disclosure of Proprietary Information. If Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, my rule, regulation or policy statement of any national securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of Receiving Party’s securities are listed or quoted) or by legal process to disclose any Proprietary Information, or any other information concerning Disclosing Party, its subsidiaries or affiliates, Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement, in order to enable Disclosing Party (a) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, (b) to consult with Receiving Party with respect to Disclosing Party’s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process or (c) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which Receiving Party is advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Proprietary Information so disclosed.
2.5 Attornev-Client Privilege. To the extent that any Proprietary Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that thy have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the disclosure of such material is not intended to, and
shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege and any such Proprietary Information shall remain entitled to all protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or my other applicable privilege.
2.6 Definitive Agreement. Until a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction has been executed by the parties hereto, neither party hereto shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Proposed Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (i) may conduct the process that may or may not result in the Proposed Transaction in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party) and (ii) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties’ consideration of the Proposed Transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party). For purposes of this Agreement, the term “definitive agreement” does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement in principle.
2.7 No Representations or Warranties Regarding Proprietary Information. Subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction and without prejudice thereto each party acknowledges that neither the other party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Proprietary Information or any use thereof. Each party hereby expressly disclaims all such warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and accuracy, and any warranties arising out of course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade. Receiving Party shall not be entitled to rely on the completeness of any Proprietary Information, but shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties regarding the completeness of the Proprietary Information as may be made to it in a definitive agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of any such agreement, should the discussions between the parties progress to such a point.
3. NO SOLICITATION
3.1 No Solicitation of Employees. Interested Party agrees that neither it nor its affiliates will at any time until the one year anniversary of the Effective Date, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for employment (i) any key technical or management personnel of the Company that has first been introduced by the Company to the Interested Party in connection with the Proposed Transaction or who was otherwise substantively involved in the discussions of the Proposed Transaction or (ii) any other person who is now employed as an officer of the other party or any of its affiliates; provided, that the foregoing restrictions hall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party or its Representatives from making general public solicitations for employment for any position or from employing any employee of the Company who either responds to such a general solicitation for employment or otherwise contacts Interested Party on his or her own initiative and without solicitation by Interested Party in contravention of the above restriction. Additionally, the above restriction shall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party from making offers of employment or offering retention packages to any employees of Company or any of its affiliates in connection with the Proposed Transaction, provided that such offers have been disclosed to the Board of Directors of the Company.
4. SECURITIES ISSUES.
4.1 No Public Disclosure Required. Each party expressly confirms and agrees that, as of the date hereof, it is not required to make any public disclosure with respect to (a) the Proposed Transaction (or the terms or conditions of any other acts relating thereto), (b) any item of Proprietary Information (or the fact that Proprietary Information bas been made available to such party), or (c) any discussions or negotiations taking place between the parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, whether pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or similar requirements related to general disclosure. If, after the date of this Agreement either party determines that any such disclosure is required, no such disclosure shall be made unless and until such party consults with the other party regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure, and provides the other party a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure and comment thereon.
4.2 Restrictions on Sales of Securities. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information. However, this will not prevent Receiving Party from purchasing stock through its benefit plans in the ordinary course of business.
5. OWNERSHIP.
All Proprietary Information (including without limitation, all copies, extracts and portions thereof) is and shall remain the sole property of Disclosing Party, provided, that all Derived Information shall be the sole property of Receiving Party. Receiving Party does not acquire (by license or otherwise, whether express or implied) any intellectual property rights or other rights under this Agreement or any disclosure hereunder, except the limited right to use such Proprietary Information in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. All rights relating to the Proprietary Information that are not expressly granted hereunder to Interested Party are reserved and retained by Disclosing Party.
6. TERM.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided that Sections 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 and Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
7. REMEDIES.
Receiving Party agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Proprietary Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Proprietary Information may cause injury to Disclosing Party, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Receiving Party agrees that Disclosing Company, in addition to any other available remedies, may have the right to seek an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement ordered by the court. Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party immediately if Receiving Party has reason to believe that any person who has had access to the Proprietary Information (including Receiving Party or any of its Representatives) has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement or otherwise disclose any Proprietary Information in violation of the terms hereof. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any ether remedy.
8. RETURN OF MATERIALS.
If either party hereto shall determine that it does not wish to proceed with the Proposed Transaction, such party shall promptly advise the other party of that decision. In that case, or if the
Proposed Transaction otherwise is not consummated for any reason, Receiving Party shall, upon Disclosing Party’s written request, promptly deliver to Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information, and, at Disclosing Party’s sole election, return or destroy (provided that my such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of Receiving Party) all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or on intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in Receiving Party’s or any of its Representatives’ possession; provided, that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Proprietary Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered. However, Receiving Party may retain in the office of its legal counsel, one copy of Proprietary Information for record purposes only. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of any Proprietary Information, or documents or material containing or reflecting any Proprietary Information, the parties will continue to be bound by their obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for the term of this Agreement (or such other term as may be applicable to the specific obligation), except as otherwise specifically provided herein.

Confidentiality Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
In connection with your consideration of a possible transaction (a “Transaction”) involving ICx Technologies, Inc. or certain of its affiliates, subsidiaries, assets and/or business divisions (collectively, the “Company”), you have requested information. In consideration of, and as a condition to, your being furnished with such information and any other Evaluation Material (as defined below), the Company hereby requests your agreement as set forth herein. As used in this letter agreement (this “Agreement”), the term “Evaluation Material” means all information regarding the Company, its businesses, technology, products, prospects and plans, a Transaction or the fact that the Company may pursue a Transaction with you or other parties, the existence and terms of this Letter Agreement and other information furnished to you in connection with the Transaction by the Company or any of its Representatives (as defined below), irrespective of form or medium of communication, whether prepared by the Company, its Representatives or otherwise and whether furnished before, on or after the date of this Agreement, together with any and all analyses, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other materials prepared by you or your Representatives that contain, are based on or otherwise incorporate, in whole or part, such information. The term “Representatives” includes, without limitation, FLIR Systems, Inc.’s affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, representatives, financial institutions providing or underwriting solely debt financing or “controlling persons” (within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)); provided, that, should you provide Evaluation Material to any such financial institution seeking to arrange debt financing, you shall promptly provide written notice to the Company as to the identity of any such financial institution. The Company is being advised by Stone Key Partners LLC and the Stone Key Securities division of Hudson Partners Securities LLC (together, “Stone Key”).
Use of Evaluation Materials
You and your Representatives (i) will use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company involving you or your affiliates and (ii) will keep the Evaluation Material strictly confidential and (except as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process, and only after compliance with the paragraph titled “Compelled Disclosure” below) will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, disclose any information in the Evaluation Material to any person, except that the Evaluation Material (or portions thereof) may be disclosed to those of your Representatives who need to know such information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company (it being understood that prior to such disclosure your Representatives will be informed of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Material, will be provided with a copy of this Agreement and will agree to be bound by the terms hereof). You will make all reasonable, necessary and appropriate efforts to safeguard Evaluation Material from disclosure to anyone other than as permitted hereby. You agree to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your Representatives (including, without limitation, any actions or inactions by your Representatives that would constitute a breach if such Representatives were original signatories hereto).
The term “Evaluation Material” does not include any information which (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives) or (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a person not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or its Representatives or prohibited from transmitting the information to you by law, contractual obligation, fiduciary duly or otherwise. As used in this Agreement, the term “person” shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, joint venture, partnership, association or individual. You agree that the Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates, as applicable, and that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives, subsidiaries or affiliates has granted you any license, copyright, or similar right with respect to any of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you by or on behalf of the Company.
Non-Disclosure
Unless otherwise required by applicable law in the reasonable written opinion of your legal counsel, but only after compliance with the paragraph titled “Compelled Disclosure” below, neither you nor your Representatives will, without the Company’s prior written consent, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including, without limitation, the status thereof, the existence and terms of this Agreement and the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available to you. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby expressly confirm and agree that no public disclosure with respect to any discussions or negotiations concerning a possible Transaction is now required by reason of securities laws or similar requirements related to general disclosure and in the event you determine that such disclosure is required in the future, no such disclosures shall be made unless and until you have consulted, to the extent permitted by applicable law or cognizant authority, with the Company regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure and otherwise complied with this paragraph.
Without limitation of the foregoing, you further agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, enter in any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or any discussions which might lead to an agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any person regarding participation in a possible Transaction as a principal, coinvestor, an equity investor or any person other than a financial institution providing or underwriting debt financing. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Representatives” as applied to you shall not include any such potential principal, co-investor, equity investor or person other than a financial institution providing or underwriting debt financing.
Compelled Disclosure
In the event that you are requested or required to disclose all or any part of the information contained in the Evaluation Material pursuant to the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a federal, state or local governmental or regulatory body or pursuant to a civil investigative demand or similar judicial process or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law or cognizant authority, you will (i) notify the Company in writing immediately of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request or requirement, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request or requirement, (iii) if disclosure of any such information is required, disclose only that portion of the information which, upon written advice of your legal counsel, you are legally required to disclose and (iv) exercise your best efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. In any event, you will cooperate with the Company to obtain such a protective order or other assurance. Any expense you incur in connection with the Company’s desire to narrow or limit the scope of the request or requirement shall be the responsibility of the Company.
Non-Solicitation of Employees
Until the earlier of (i) the consummation by you of a Transaction, (ii) eighteen months after termination of discussions relating to a possible Transaction between you and the Company, and (iii) two years from the date of this Agreement, you will not, without the Company’s prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire, entice away or offer to enter into any contract with, or hire any employee of the Company: provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from engagement in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to the Company’s employees or hiring employees who respond to such a solicitation with no other action or by you or your Representatives in violation of this provision: and provided, further, that, following execution by you and the Company of a definitive agreement providing for a Transaction between you and the Company, this paragraph shall not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from offering employees employment in anticipation of and conditioned upon the consummation of such Transaction.
Standstill
You represent and warrant to the Company that, as of the date hereof, you do not beneficially own any securities of the Company or any securities or contract rights (other than broadly based index funds) the terms or value of which are dependent on securities of the Company. For a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, you will not, directly or indirectly, and you will cause any person or entity controlled by you not to, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any securities or contract rights (other than broadly based index funds) the terms or value of which are dependent on securities of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, partnership, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its affiliates, (iii) make, or in any way participate in any “solicitation” of “proxies” (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934 Act) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (v) negotiate, have any discussions or enter into any arrangements, understandings or agreements (whether written or oral) with, or advise, finance, assist or encourage, any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing, or, make any investment in any other person that engages, or offers or proposes to engage, in any of the foregoing (it being understood that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall not be permitted to act as a joint bidder or co-bidder with any other person with respect to the Company), (vi) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vii) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (viii) advise, assist or encourage any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing. Unless and until you have received the prior written invitation or approval of the Company to do so, you also agree during such period not to (x) request the Company (or Company Representatives), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence), (y) take any action which might require the Company or any of its affiliates to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement or the possibility of a merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction, including, without limitation, a Transaction or (z) communicate with the Company’s shareholders regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.
Prohibition on Trading
In addition, you hereby acknowledge that you are aware, and that you will advise your Representatives who receive any Evaluation Material, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer (and options, warrants and rights relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) is likely to purchase or sell such securities. You hereby agree that neither you nor your Representatives will use or communicate the Evaluation Material in violation of these laws.
Return or Destruction of Documents
If you determine that you do not wish to proceed with a Transaction or your evaluation thereof, you will promptly advise the Company and Stone Key in writing of that decision. In that case, or in the event that (i) a Transaction is not consummated by you or (ii) at any time the Company so requests, you will promptly (a) deliver to the Company all of the Evaluation Material, including all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives or
(b) destroy all Evaluation Material in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives (such destruction to be certified by you in writing to the Company). Notwithstanding the delivery or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you agree that you and your Representatives shall continue to be bound by your obligations under this Agreement.
No Unauthorized Contact
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company, all (i) communications regarding any possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information or Evaluation Material, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to Stone Key. You further agree not to contact any officers, directors or employees of the Company in connection with a possible Transaction without the prior written consent of the Company.
No Obligation, Representation or Warranty
This Agreement does not constitute or create any obligation of the Company or its Representatives to provide any Evaluation Material or other information to you, but defines the duties and obligations of you and your Representatives with respect to the Evaluation Material to the extent it may be disclosed or made available. Under no circumstances will the Company or any of its Representatives be obligated to disclose or make available any information, including, without limitation, any Evaluation Material, which the Company in its sole and absolute discretion determines not to disclose.

You agree that the Company will not be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Transaction by virtue of

Acting as Principal
You represent and warrant that you are acting as a principal in any possible Transaction and are not represented by any broker or similar party.

The Recipient further agrees that prior to granting such Representatives access to the Confidential Information, the Recipient shall inform such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and of the terms of this agreement and require such Representatives to agree to abide by all the terms included herein.

As a condition to such information being furnished to each party, its affiliates, its subsidiaries and other individuals and entities controlled, directly or indirectly, by such party (“Affiliates”), and the respective directors, employees, consultants, accountants, attorneys and advisors of such party and its Affiliates with which such party has entered into confidentiality agreements with material terms that are substantially similar to those in this Agreement (collectively with such Affiliates, “Associates”), each party agrees such information shall be provided to Associates for the limited purpose of evaluating, negotiating or consummating the Transaction, to treat the other party’s Confidential Information in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and to take or abstain from taking certain other actions, as described in this Agreement.

The term “Confidential Information” shall be deemed to include those portions of any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents (regardless of the form thereof) prepared by the receiving party or its Associates which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any information furnished to the receiving party or its Associates pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information, technical data or know-how which: (i) is in the possession of the receiving party or its Associates at the time of disclosure, as shown by files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (ii) prior to or after the time of disclosure becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving party or its Associates; (iii) is obtained by the receiving party or its Associates from a source other than the disclosing party or its Associates, which source would not be reasonably expected by the
receiving party or its Associates to have any obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party with respect to such information; (iv) is approved, in writing, for release by the disclosing party; or (v) the receiving party or its Associates can document was independently developed by the receiving party or its Associates without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

The receiving party shall inform its Associates of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall instruct them to treat the information confidentially. The receiving party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Associates and agrees, at its sole expense, to take all commercially reasonable measures to restrain its Associates from disclosure or use of the Confidential Information in breach of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will take commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of, and to avoid having Confidential Information of the other party enter the public domain, become publicly available, or be held by persons not authorized hereunder to have such Confidential Information, which measures shall include at least the same degree of care that the receiving party utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature.

2. Nonpublicity.

In the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained in such a proceeding, or the disclosing party fails to waive compliance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the receiving party agrees that it will, and will direct its Associates to, disclose only that Confidential Information of the disclosing party which its counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed and will exercise commercially reasonable efforts, and will direct its Associates to exercise their commercially reasonable efforts, at the request and expense of the disclosing party, to cooperate with the disclosing party in its efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information which is so disclosed.
4. No License Granted. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right, nor shall this Agreement grant either party any rights in or to the other party’s Confidential Information, except the limited right to review such Confidential Information solely for the purposes of determining whether to enter into, and the undertaking of or the advising with respect to, a Transaction.
5. No Representation of Accuracy.· Each party acknowledges that neither the other party nor any of its Associates has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information made available by the other party or its Associates. Each party agrees that, except as set forth in a definitive agreement executed by the parties, neither party nor any of its Associates shall have any liability to the other party or to any of its Associates relating to or resulting from the use of such other party’s Confidential Information or any errors therein m omissions therefrom. Only those representations or warranties made in a definitive agreement, when, as and if executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified therein, will have any legal effect.
6. Definitive Agreements. Each party acknowledges and agrees that other than with respect to the matters specifically set forth herein, no contract or agreement providing a Transaction shall be deemed to exist between the parties unless and until a definitive agreement has been executed and delivered. The parties further agree that each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals made by the other party or any of its Associates with regard to a Transaction and to terminate discussions or negotiations at any time.
7. Similar Products. Each disclosing party acknowledges that the receiving party or its Associates may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties, that is similar to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the receiving party or its Associates from developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, servicing or supporting or having developed, manufactured, marketed, sold, serviced or supported for it products, concepts, systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, provided that the receiving party and its Associates do not use any of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in connection with such activities. Neither party nor its respective Associates shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of its respective employees or consultants as a result of their having had access to Confidential Information of the other party or its Associates.
8. Residuals. The receiving party’s employees may use any Residuals for any purpose, provided that this paragraph does not grant or imply any license or other right to use any patent, trademark, copyright, mask work right or other intellectual property right. “Residuals” means information that is retained, as general knowledge and experience, in the
unaided memory of the receiving party’s employees who have had access to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information within the scope of the receiving party’s obligations under this Agreement, but who no longer have access to such Confidential Information.
