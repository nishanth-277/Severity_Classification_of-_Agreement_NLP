The Earth monitoring competition Copernicus Masters aims to support the development of market-oriented applications based on Earth observation data. In 2017, the Copernicus Masters is again enriched by the Copernicus Accelerator, a European Commission programme. Through this initiative, the 50 best finalists of the Copernicus Masters, selected by an international expert panel will automatically be granted access to a business coaching scheme provided by high-level professionals, that will act as mentors. To actively participate in the Copernicus Accelerator programme, Mentor commits to the following Non-Disclosure-Agreement and Terms of Participation.\n1 Eligibility\nMentor is a resident of one of the Copernicus participating countries1 or is employed with a legal identity registered in the territory of one of the Copernicus participating countries, willing to support and help develop the Ideas of the finalists of the Copernicus Masters 2017 (hereinafter \u201cParticipants\u201d). Professionals who pursue becoming mentors need to apply via the dedicated platform, inserting all required details, which can be edited anytime by Mentor. Their request needs to be validated by the Organiser and the European Commission, who can refuse participation in case of non-eligibility or conflict of interest. After verification of all details entered, the Organiser will notify the Mentor about the outcome of his/her submission.\nEven after validation, the Organiser cannot guarantee that there will be an actual match between Mentor and Participants. Mentor confirms that Mentor has not been involved in the development of any of the Ideas to be coached at any stage and that Mentor has no personal or commercial connection to any Participant of the Copernicus Accelerator that would influence an objective development of Ideas.\n1 The Copernicus Participating countries include all the EU Member States, in addition to Norway and Iceland.\n2 Procedure and Terms of Participation\nThe Copernicus Accelerator programme is comprised of different phases, for a total coaching support of approximately one year, aimed at helping Participants\u00b4 Ideas achieving measurable results. When submitting the request to become Mentor, Mentor needs to specify in which fields he/she can support Participants, in order to allow a suitable matchmaking with the requests and needs communicated by Participants.\nWhen a Mentor is requested by a Participant of the programme, he/she can access the Participant's profile and examine the submitted idea, in order to decide whether to confirm the request or not. Mentors can only advise up to two participants.\nMentors will meet the Participants at the Accelerator Bootcamp, that will take place in line with the Awards Ceremony of the Copernicus Masters, the European Satellite Navigation Competition (ESNC), and the accompanying Satellite Masters Conference from 6 - 8 November 2017 in Tallinn, Estonia. Mentor\u00b4s participation to this event is mandatory, as it will set forth the official start of their relationship: Mentor and Participants will begin developing a coaching plan together, that will include objectives and KPIs of their affiliation.\nMonthly virtual interactions need to be planned by Mentor, to ensure a continuous acceleration of the Participants Ideas\u00b4 towards business maturity. A mid-term review and survey will be required by April 2018, to evaluate progress made and ensure that the recommendations of the coaching plan are currently implemented by Participants. In case of a non-positive matching or non-compliance to his/her assigned duties (having monthly interactions with the mentees, keeping contacts with the Copernicus Accelerator team, promptly informing the organizers about any relevant issue connected to the coaching relationship), Mentor may be replaced by a more suitable candidate for the Participants\u00b4 needs.\nMentor will actively support Participants until July 2018, and will then submit a final report together, detailing the outcome of the coaching experience. The Organiser will continuously monitor all relationships, in order to assist both parties and guarantee a positive outcome of the programme. Mentor needs to deliver all requested reports and schedule all requested meetings. The Organiser will provide Mentor with templates for the documents to be produced. Mentors and Participants will meet again at the closing bootcamp, held in October/November 2018, that will official seal the closing of their mentoring relationship.\nAt the end of the coaching service, Mentor will fill in a questionnaire on the coaching service and the overall experience and will also be subject to a specific questionnaire compiled by Participants.\n3 Payment\nThe Organiser will reimburse Mentor the travel arrangements and accommodation for the Acceleration Bootcamp in Tallinn in 2017 (a maximum of EUR 800) and the closing bootcamp in 2018 (a maximum of EUR 700). The coaching service provided by Mentor is worth a maximum fee of EUR 5,000 (VAT excluded) per Participant coached, that will be remunerated to Mentor at the end of the programme, after the submission and approval of the final summary report of the coaching relationships. Payment shall be made within 30 days from the receipt of invoice, and following the invoice verification by Organiser. No deductions will be made from the gross fees paid to mentor who shall be solely responsible for ensuring that all and any Government taxes and other deductions are paid by him/her.\n4 Definition of Confidential Information\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any Idea disclosed to Mentor, all data and information, know-how, business concepts, software, procedures, products, services, development projects, and programmes contained in such Idea and/or its description and any conclusions. Confidential Information does not include:\n> information already known or independently developed by Mentor prior to the disclosure of any Idea;\n> information already in the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor; or\n> information received from a third party who was free to disclose such information.\nIn case of doubt any information is deemed to be Confidential Information unless Mentor proves that such information is not confidential.\n5 Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information / Obligations of Mentor\nMentor shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to review, assess and help develop the Participants\u00b4 Ideas.\nMentor shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party or to Mentor\u2019s employees and/or employer without the prior written consent of the Participants. Mentor shall require his/her employees who will have access to Confidential Information to commit to a non-disclosure agreement that protects the Confidential Information to at least the same degree as this Agreement. Mentor shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of, and avoid any unauthorised disclosure or use of Confidential Information. Such measures shall include the highest degree of care that Mentor utilises to protect Mentor\u2019s own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than reasonable care.\nNotwithstanding Mentor\u2019s right to assess and rate the Ideas of the Participants, Mentor shall not use the Confidential information for his/her own or third parties purposes and shall not file for any intellectual property right protection for the Confidential Information or parts of it.\nMentor shall notify Organiser immediately in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of any Confidential Information that may come to Mentor\u2019s attention. Mentor agrees to segregate all Confidential Information relating to this agreement from Confidential Information of others to avoid commingling.\n6 Discontinuation of Use, Return of Materials\nAt Organiser\u2019s first request, Mentor shall:\n(a) discontinue all use of Confidential Information;\n(b) return to Organiser and/or Participants all materials furnished by Organiser and/or Participants that contain Confidential Information;\n(c) destroy any copy and all materials produced by and under control of Organiser and/or Participants that contain Confidential Information;\n(d) erase and/or destroy any Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus of, under control of or used by Mentor;\n(e) remove the Confidential Information from any software or data base of, under control of/or used by Mentor that incorporates or uses the Confidential Information in whole or in part; and\n(f) warrant in writing to Organiser, within ten (10) days after Organiser\u2019s request, that Mentor has taken all actions set out under (a) through (e) in this Clause 4.\n7 Notice of Required Disclosure\nIf Mentor is required by mandatory, non-appealable judicial or administrative process and/or order to disclose Confidential Information, then Mentor shall promptly notify Organiser and allow Organiser and the Participants reasonable time to oppose such process unless this is not admissible under a mandatory law, judicial or administrative order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mentor shall disclose Confidential Information only to the minimum extent required to comply with such order.\n8 Proprietary Rights, Limited Right to Use\nAny and all proprietary rights, including but not limited to rights to and in inventions, patent rights, utility models, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, in and to any Confidential Information shall be and remain with the Participants respectively, and Mentor shall not have any right, license, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information, except the limited right to review, assess and help develop such Confidential Information in connection with the Copernicus Accelerator 2017.\n9 Term\nThis Agreement shall be effective as of 2 May 2017 and may not be terminated except for important cause. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, any Confidential Information must be kept confidential for as long as such Confidential Information is not publicly known unless it becomes part of the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor. This agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both parties.\n10 Governing Law\nThis Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by the material laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n11 Jurisdiction\nThe place of jurisdiction for any and all legal disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement is Munich (Landgericht M\u00fcnchen I). Imperative places of jurisdiction under German Law shall remain unaffected by the foregoing.\n12 Notification of Unauthorised Use\nMentor shall notify Organiser immediately upon discovery of any unauthorised use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Mentor, and will cooperate with\nOrganiser in every reasonable way to help Organiser regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorised use or publication.\n13 Remedies\nMentor acknowledges that his/her obligations under this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the Ideas and the Confidential Information. Each party further acknowledges that any breach by Mentor of Mentor\u2019s covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or threatened violation of such may cause irreparable injury to Organiser and to Participants.\n14 Miscellaneous\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon Organiser and Mentor, and their successors and assigns. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both\nof the parties.\nThe failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this Agreement.\nMentor is aware that an unauthorised disclosure of the Ideas and of the assessment and development of the Ideas and of any Confidential Information may lead to serious damage to Participants and the Organiser of the Copernicus Accelerator 2017. This Agreement shall be for the benefit of the Participants.\nThe Organiser and the European Commission will use the Mentor\u00b4s contact information to inform him/her of all matters related to the Copernicus Accelerator 2017 and of any other issues the Organiser and the European Commission deem relevant and appropriate. The failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this agreement.\n"","

ATTORNEY'S FEES: If any legal action is brought by any party hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in such action or dispute shall be entitled to recover from the other party attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other relief that may be awarded. For the purpose of this Paragraph, the \""prevailing party\"" shall be the party in whose favor a final judgment is entered.\nVIII. SEVERABILITY: It is the intent and agreement of the parties to this agreement that, in case any one or more of the provisions of this agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this agreement and this agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein except that this shall not prohibit any modification allowed or agreed upon pursuant to the terms of this agreement or any right of reformation.\nIX. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the procedural and substantive laws of the State of Missouri. The parties to this Agreement consent and designate St. Louis County, Missouri as the sole venue and location for any suit or other proceeding of any kind regarding any aspect of this agreement and all issues arising out of or relating to the independent relationship between the parties.\nX. ASSIGNMENT: This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and the assigns of all parties herein. Each party may assign or transfer this Agreement to a successor business entity in the event of a merger, consolidation, transfer or sale of the assets of said party.

EQUITABLE RELIEF: Each party recognizes that any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the other party, the extent of which would be difficult and impracticable to assess, and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for such breach. Accordingly, in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedies at law or in equity available under the circumstances, and notwithstanding any jurisdiction and venue requirements of this Agreement, each party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other non-monetary equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need or requirement of any bond, provided that if a bond is required, the bond shall not exceed $1,000.00.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties, intending to be legally bound, have executed this Agreement as of the last date set forth below by the undersigned duly authorized representatives.\nDealer Pay, LLC ________________________________(Company)\nPO Box 1691\n________________________________(Street Address)\nSt. Charles, MO 63302\n________________________________(City, State, Zip)\nJulie R.

Confidential Information. It is contemplated that Confidential Information (as defined herein) will be transferred from Discloser to Recipient in connection herewith and that Confidential Information shall be used by Recipient only for purposes of evaluating whether it might have interest in discussing Business Opportunities with Recipient.\na. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any proprietary information belonging to Discloser relating to: (i) Discloser\u2019s proprietary technology, systems, service offering and products, including without limitation, plans and specifications, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product plans, ideas or concepts, services, software, inventions, intellectual property rights, techniques, processes, developments, algorithms, formulas, technology, designs, schematics, drawings, engineering, and hardware configuration information (collectively referred to as \u201cTechnical Information\u201d); and (ii) proprietary information relating to the financial information of any of the principals of Discloser, Discloser\u2019s corporate financial information or its operations and business or financial plans or strategies, including but not limited to its identity, customers, customer lists, markets, real estate development plans, financial statements and projections, products, product pricing and marketing, financial or other strategic business plans or information (collectively referred to as \u201cBusiness Information\u201d), disclosed to Recipient by Discloser, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of samples, equipment or facilities. For purposes of this agreement, Confidential Information shall be assumed to be of a confidential and/or proprietary nature by Recipient, as it is reasonable to assume and expect that said Business Information is highly relevant to the success of its Discloser\u2019s business and is not known to the public.\nb. The restrictions set forth herein shall not apply with respect to information designated by Discloser as Confidential which: (i) is known by Recipient at the time of receipt as evidenced by Recipient\u2019s records; (ii) is or becomes a part of the public domain without breach of the Agreement by Recipient; (iii) is obtained by Recipient from a third party under conditions permitting its disclosure to others; (iv) is independently developed by Recipient; or (v) is disclosed by Recipient pursuant to judicial action or Government regulations provided Recipient notifies Discloser prior to such disclosure and cooperates with Discloser in the event Discloser elects to legally contest and avoid such disclosure.\n2. Identification of Confidential Information. For the purpose of the Agreement, written Business or Technical Information (including that which is delivered electronically) that is considered to be Confidential Information by Discloser, shall be so marked by Discloser. Information that is furnished orally shall be considered Confidential Information if Discloser so indicates. Additionally, information furnished by Discloser shall be deemed Confidential Information if it is obvious from its content, in the context under which it is furnished.\n3. Subsequent Notice of Confidentiality. Discloser may give notice in writing that written or verbal information that has been previously furnished, but not declared confidential, is in fact confidential. This information is to be treated as Confidential Information by Recipient from the time of receipt of said notice. That being said, Recipient shall make every reasonable effort to mark all written copies of such information under its control as \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d and to make every reasonable effort to inform Discloser of any disclosures by Recipient to third parties of such information that may have occurred between the time of receipt of the information and receipt by Recipient of notice that such information is confidential. Recipient has no responsibility to attempt to control the use of such information by such a third party.\n4. Term, Non-Disclosure and Use. For a period of two (2) years from the date of receipt, all Confidential Information shall be maintained in confidence by Recipient, shall not be disclosed, published, communicated, divulged or revealed in any manner, to any other person, firm, corporation or other third party entity, including employees of Recipient who do not have a need to know, or who should not know any such details pertaining to Confidential Information in the course of their employment, except as may otherwise provided in this Agreement. Recipient further affirmatively agrees not to use any Confidential Information received from Discloser except for the express purposes set forth herein.\n5. No License Granted. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not be construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or implicitly, any rights or licenses to Recipient, by the furnishing of Confidential Information by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement.\n6. Ownership and Return of Confidential Information. All tangible information, including drawings, specifications and other information furnished hereunder shall remain the property of Discloser. Upon request, or if either party elects not to pursue any further business undertaking with the other, Recipient shall promptly return all tangible information, including any and all copies or partial copies thereof and thereupon confirm destruction of all information held electronically.\n7. No Warranty. No warranty or representation is made by Discloser that any information transmitted by it hereunder is true and correct, patentable or copyrightable, or that any such information involves concepts or embodiments that are free of infringement of other rights.\n8. Equitable Relief. Discloser and Recipient agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to measure and calculate Discloser\u2019s damages from any breach of the covenants set forth herein, especially with regard any breach associated with Confidential Information that was to be maintained behind the Information Barrier. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, Discloser will have available, in addition to any other right or remedy available, the right to obtain an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and to specific performance of any such provision of this Agreement. Recipient further agrees that no bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and that Recipient hereby consents to the issuance of such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance. If any action or proceeding is brought to enforce this Agreement because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, should it prevail, Discloser shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in such action or proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.\n9. Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective as of date hereof and shall terminate upon the express written termination by either one of the parties hereto. Termination of the Agreement shall not relieve either party of any obligation set forth in Paragraphs 4 or 6 with respect to Confidential Information, and all such obligations shall continue until expiration of the period set 10. General Provisions. The following general provisions shall apply:\n(a) Governing Law: This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n(b) Severability: If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\n(c) Successors and Assigns: This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the parties hereto.\n(d) Headings.

For the contracting parties\u2019 protection, such information shall be subject to confidentiality. This agreement is exclusively concerned with the cooperation concerning the thesis as defined. The cooperation is based on mutual trust; disagreements will be settled amicably.\n\u00a7 1 Prohibited Actions\nThe contracting parties mutually agree not to make available to third parties without prior consent any confidential information which was made available to them during the duration of this agreement by the student or the contractual partner.

Where the author has clearly marked the graded assessment\u2019s cover page with a lock flag (\u201cSperrvermerk\u201d), the university, following the completion of the assessment procedure, will store the work in a proper and protected place.\n\u00a7 4 Permission\n(1) The university is permitted to handle confidential information in such a way and to such an extent as is necessary and usual to execute the cooperation; this included photocopying. In particular, the university is permitted to reveal confidential information to third parties in as far as this is necessary to allow for the proper performance of the assessment process. The proper performance of the assessment process includes all steps of the process including legal proceeding to object to assessment decision and an examination for plagiarism; the relevant examination and legal regulations apply.

A party making information available to the other, reserves the right to register its own protective rights with regard to the subject of such information.\n\u00a7 7 Coming into Force and Duration\nThe agreement comes into force at such time as the last party signs the agreement. Any duties under this agreement seize to exist five years after the coming into force thereof.\n\u00a7 8 Legal Relationships Existing Outside this Agreement\nNo employment or similar contract exists between the university and the student but a relationship governed by examination regulations. Thus the university does not have the right to impose a duty of confidentiality upon the student. The university is not liable for the student\u2019s compliance with any bilateral confidentiality agreements between student and company.\n\u00a7 9 Other\nOral agreement will be considered null and void. Any additions or amendments to this contract have to be in writing. The formal requirement can only be waived in writing.

OBLIGATION OF NON-COMPETITION\nThe non-competition provisions of this Agreement are an essential and material part of the total agreement, by which the Parties agree they shall not use any advantages derivable from such confidential information in their own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement executed by all signatories to this document.\n5. NON-CIRCUMVENTION\nThe Parties hereby agree on behalf of themselves, their officers, directors, agents, associates and any related parties, that they will not, directly or indirectly, contact, deal with or otherwise become involved with any entity or any other entities or parties introduced, directly or indirectly, by or through the other party, its officers, directors, agents or associates, for the purpose of avoiding the payment to the other Party of profits, fees or other amounts, without the specific written approval of the other Party.\n6. NO REPRESENTATIONS\nThe Parties both understand that each Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information it provides. The Parties both agree that neither Party, nor any of its advisers, representatives, agents, or employees shall be held liable for utilization of Confidential Information which results from the other Party\u2019s use of said information.\n7.

None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of IBC, the Vendor, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of IBC and the Vendor. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion. No employee, agent or representative of IBC is authorized to make any additional representation, warranty or covenant on behalf of IBC.\n(e) If either party employs lawyers to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable lawyers\u2019 fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws in force in the Province of Ontario, and the parties further consent to non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal or provincial courts sitting in Toronto, Ontario.

Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.

Recipient will not disseminate or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm, business or governmental agency or department, except as such disclosure is expressly permitted in this Agreement. Recipient will treat all of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as Recipient treats its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care. Recipient will disclose Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information only to those of Recipient\u2019s employees, consultants, and contractors who have a \u201cneed to know\u201d the information to assist Recipient with respect to the Purpose and who are legally bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those terms and conditions applicable to Recipient under this Agreement.

A disclosure by Recipient of any of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information (a) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body; (b) as otherwise required by law; or (c) necessary to establish the rights of either party under this Agreement will not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient; provided, however, that Recipient provides prompt prior written notice to the Discloser to enable Discloser to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent the disclosure.\n4. Neither party will communicate any information to the other in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party.

All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement will be and will remain the property of the Discloser; all such information in tangible form will be returned to Discloser promptly upon written request or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and will not thereafter be retained in any form by Recipient or its Affiliates or any of their employees. Except upon mutual written agreement or as may be required by law, neither party will disclose to others the existence or terms of this Agreement, the discussions that gave rise to this Agreement or the fact that there have been, or will be, discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement.\n8. The parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information is unique and valuable and a breach by Recipient of this Agreement will cause irreparable and continuing damage to Discloser for which money damages are insufficient. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the obligations under this Agreement, Discloser will be entitled to: (1) seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond, and (ii) indemnification from any loss or harm, including recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, in connection with any breach or enforcement of Recipient\u2019s obligations hereunder or the unauthorized use or release of such Confidential Information.

Additionally, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a claim for equitable relief arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except to an Affiliate, without the prior written consent of the other party. No failure or delay in exercising or any partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision will be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties as expressed herein.\nThe parties agree and are signing this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\nFULLSTORY, INC. _________________\nBy: By:\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title:\n"","

Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThe Partner shall protect the confidential information disclosed to him in connection with the project or to which he is given access in connection with the project from being disclosed to third parties, being used by third parties or being published at least with the same diligence he applies in order to protect his own confidential information of identical importance.\nThe Partner shall use confidential information from M&R for no other purposes than the project unless M&R has approved of such a different use in writing beforehand.\nIf further third parties are involved in the project, the Partner shall not disclose or make available confidential information to the third party before M&R has approved of that and the third party has also committed himself to strict confidentiality.\nConfidential information may only be passed on to general managers, employees, representatives or consultants of the Partner for whom the disclosure of or access to such confidential information is demonstrably necessary in the scope of the project. Insofar as these parties are not already bound to secrecy because of a work contract and/or based on a statutory non-disclosure obligation, these parties have to be bound to secrecy beforehand by making them sign a declaration according to Annex 1, and that also beyond the termination of their employment; this shall apply independently of the type or the legal arrangement of the employment.\nUnless otherwise provided for in this agreement, the above-mentioned obligations of this Section II shall apply in each case for a period of 3 (three) years after the point in time at which the respective confidential information was disclosed by M&R or made accessible to the Partner.\nIII.

If this immediate legal action and/or a different legal remedy is not obtained within a reasonable period of time, the Partner that is obliged to disclose shall only disclose the part of the confidential information to the disclosure of which he is obliged by law.\nIV.

Confidential information that has to be kept in order to comply with legal obligations, in particular archiving obligations, shall be excepted from that.\nVIII. No Liability for the Correctness of the Confidential Information\nM&R accepts no liability for the use or the trust in the correctness or completeness of the confidential information disclosed to the Partner.\nIX.

Court Order. Notwithstanding the above, the Recipient shall not be in violation of this Agreement if the disclosure is in response to a valid subpoena or order by a court or other government body, provided the Recipient presents the Provider with as much prior written notice of such disclosure as is reasonable in order to permit the Provider an opportunity to seek confidential treatment of such information.\n5. Care. The Recipient will use at least as much care in maintaining the confidentiality of any disclosed Information as that party uses in maintaining its own Confidential Information, and the Recipient will use at least reasonable care.\n6.

IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT.\nThis Agreement was last updated on July 3, 2018. This Agreement is between the entity or individual entering into this Agreement (\u201cYou\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d) and BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cBMC\u201d), located at 2103 CityWest Blvd., Houston, Texas 77042. A copy of this Agreement is posted at http://www.bmc.com/legal/agreements.html, where it can be saved and/or printed. It is effective between You and BMC as of the date of your acceptance of this Agreement.\n1. Scope. BMC and You (the \u201cParties\u201d) desire to disclose certain confidential information in connection with (a) an existing business relationship, (b) the discussion or validation of business proposals or design concepts, or (c) a future business relationship (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\n2. Discloser and Recipient. As to any particular Proprietary Information (defined below), the \u201cDiscloser\u201d is the Party disclosing the Proprietary Information and the \u201cRecipient\u201d is the Party receiving the Proprietary Information.\n3. Proprietary Information. \u201cProprietary Information\u201d means any confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information concerning Discloser\u2019s (a) customers\u2019 identity, finances, and data, and (b) personnel, business practices, business policies, the terms of any agreements between the Parties, pricing information, information relating to research and development, know-how, methodologies, inventions, specifications, software, market analyses, research strategies, projections, forecasts, proposal related documents and responses, data center and/or facility procedures and operations, data center and/or facility audit results, and compilations, summaries, analyses, copies, or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of the foregoing, except to the extent to which Recipient can establish by legally sufficient evidence that such information: (i) was rightfully in Recipient\u2019s possession without obligation of confidentiality before receipt from Discloser; (ii) is or has become a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; (iii) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without violation of any duty of confidentiality; (iv) is or was independently developed by or for Recipient without use or reference to the Proprietary Information or (v) was disclosed by Discloser to a third party without an obligation of confidentiality. Subject to the foregoing exceptions, \u201cProprietary Information\u201d also includes, without limitation, third-party information that Discloser has the right to disclose to Recipient. Nothing disclosed under this Agreement is considered Proprietary Information unless (a) it is received in a tangible form and is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d, (b) is received in intangible form and is followed up within a reasonable period of time with a writing describing it and designating it as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d, or (c) it is something by either the substance of which or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure would lead a reasonable person to believe it is confidential or proprietary.\n4. Restrictions on Use and Non-Disclosure of Proprietary Information. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in writing by an authorized representative of Discloser, Recipient may not:\n(a) use the Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to further the business relationship of the Parties and for the sole benefit of Discloser; or\n(b) directly or indirectly disclose Proprietary Information to any person or entity other than Recipient\u2019s employees and consultants who (i) have a need to know in order to fulfill the Purpose, (ii) have been advised of the Proprietary Information\u2019s confidential status, and (iii) are subject to legally binding obligations of confidentiality as to such Proprietary Information, which are no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement, provided, that Recipient is at all times fully responsible to Discloser for compliance with this Agreement by such employees and consultants.\n5. Standard of Care. Recipient shall use at least the same degree (but no less than a reasonable degree) of care and protection to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Proprietary Information as Recipient uses to protect its own confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.\n6. Ownership; Suggestions. Recipient may not assert any claim of title or ownership to the Proprietary Information or any portion thereof. In the course of the discussions facilitated in the Customer Program, You may be providing to BMC feedback and suggestions relevant to the functionality, performance, features, and operation of BMC\u2019s products and services (\u201cSuggestions\u201d) the purpose of their disclosure being to assist BMC and its affiliates to deliver BMC products that include the functionality, performance, features, and operation in BMC products that You need and desire to have. In order for BMC to be able to act on such Suggestions, BMC needs to have Your permission to do something with Your Suggestions, therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, You hereby assign to BMC all rights, title and interest in the Suggestions and in all intellectual property therein. Although not usually necessary, if requested by BMC, You agree to execute such further instruments as BMC may reasonably request confirming BMC\u2019s ownership in Your Suggestions.\n7. Disclosures Required by Law. In the event Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any Proprietary Information, Recipient shall provide Discloser with prior written notice of such requirement as soon as Recipient becomes aware of such requirement, such that Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if Discloser waives in writing compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Recipient agrees to (a) furnish only that portion of the Proprietary Information which Recipient is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be furnished and (b) exercise reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of the portion of Proprietary Information that is furnished.\n8. Confidentiality Period. Recipient\u2019s obligations under paragraphs 3 through 5 expire on the earlier of (a) notification from the Discloser that the Proprietary Information is no longer confidential, or (b) the Parties\u2019 entry into a separate, subsequent agreement that contains confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions that supersede this Agreement as to that Proprietary Information.\n9. No Liability. Discloser makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, accuracy, and completeness of the Proprietary Information, and neither Discloser nor its representatives have any liability whatsoever with respect to Recipient\u2019s use of or reliance upon the Proprietary Information.\n10. Disposal of Proprietary Information. Recipient agrees to destroy or return to Discloser all copies of Proprietary Information promptly upon the earlier of (a) Discloser\u2019s request at any time, or (b) the duration of the confidentiality period established in Section 8(a) of this Agreement.\n11. Data Protection. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Parties may share contact details such as name, mail address, email address, telephone numbers, etc., in connection with the Purpose (\u201cContact Details\u201d). Such Contact Details may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws.

In particular, each party shall:\n(a) ensure that it may lawfully transfer Contact Details to the other party;\n(b) inform employees, consultants or potential employees, consultants of the transfer to the other party;\n(c) process the Contact Details only pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with applicable data protection laws;\n(d) ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of Contact Details and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, the Contact Details;\n(e) provide reasonable assistance to the other party in complying with applicable data protection laws; and\n(f) delete or return to the other party upon request all Contact Details, including copies, unless legally prohibited.\n12. Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a breach of this Agreement by either Party may cause irreparable injury to the other\u2019s business as a result of any such violation, for which the remedies at law may be inadequate, and that Discloser is therefore entitled to seek, in addition to any other remedies available to Discloser, a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief against Recipient, provided the Discloser can meet the legal requirements therefor.\n13. Miscellaneous. No failure, delay, or single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement by either Party is a waiver of such right. This Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing by the Parties expressly modifying or waiving any provision of this Agreement. Neither the provision of Proprietary Information under this Agreement nor the execution of this Agreement binds or obligates either Party to any business relationship, and neither Party is bound or obligated to any such relationship with the other Party until the Parties execute a binding written agreement specifically describing such relationship. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will be unaffected and remain in effect. Any additional documents presented to a BMC representative by Customer for signature as a condition for going on a Customer\u2019s site will be governed by this Agreement and to the extent that such document presents additional terms or conflicts with this Agreement, it shall be considered null and void.\n14. Compliance with Law. The Parties agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to (i) Proprietary Information, or (ii) any product (or part thereof), process, or service that is the direct result of the Proprietary Information, including without limitation, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments.\n15. Attorney\u2019s Fees. If either Party engages legal counsel to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\n16.

During these discussions, Disclosing Party may share certain proprietary information with the Recipient. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information.\n(a) For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial information, or projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans and performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such party, its affiliates, subsidiaries and affiliated companies; (ii) plans for products or services, and customer or supplier lists; (iii) any scientific or technical information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, improvement, technology or method; (iv) any concepts, reports, data, know-how, works-in-progress, designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; and (v) any other information that should reasonably be recognized as confidential information of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information need not be novel, unique, patentable, copyrightable or constitute a trade secret in order to be designated Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is proprietary to the Disclosing Party, has been developed and obtained through great efforts by the Disclosing Party and that Disclosing Party regards all of its Confidential Information as trade secrets\n(b) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes rightfully known to the Receiving Party from a third-party source not known (after diligent inquiry) by the Receiving Party to be under an obligation to Disclosing Party to maintain confidentiality; (c) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of or failure to act by the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement; (d) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or is otherwise requested or required to be disclosed by law or regulation, although the requirements of paragraph 4 hereof shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been independently developed by employees, consultants or agents of the Receiving Party without violation of the terms of this Agreement or reference or access to any Confidential Information.\n2. Disclosure of Confidential Information.\nFrom time to time, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party will: (a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives (collectively \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who have a need to know such Confidential Information in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties to which this Agreement relates, and only for that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement and require such Representatives to keep the Confidential Information confidential; (c) shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and (d) not disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein).\nEach party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of their respective Representatives.\n3. Use of Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties and not for any purpose other than as authorized by this Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party. No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to the Receiving Party hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in the Disclosing Party. All use of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit of the Disclosing Party and any modifications and improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property of the Disclosing Party.

Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.\nNotwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial, or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, regulatory request or similar method, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure so that the Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided in the case of a broad regulatory request with respect to the Receiving Party\u2019s business (not targeted at Disclosing Party), the Receiving Party may promptly comply with such request provided the Receiving Party give (if permitted by such regulator) the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such disclosure. The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with efforts by, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a protective order and the Receiving Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability.\n5. Term.\nThis Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to a one year extension if the parties are still discussing and considering the Transaction at the end of the second year).

The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time. This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between the parties. If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any applicable transaction documents entered into between the parties (or their respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this Agreement. In the event such provision is not provided for in said transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.\n10. Warranty.\nEach party warrants that it has the right to make the disclosures under this Agreement. NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER.

Further, neither party is under any obligation under this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information it chooses not to disclose. Neither Party hereto shall have any liability to the other party or to the other party\u2019s Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with respect to disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.\n11.

This Agreement can only be modified by a written amendment signed by the party against whom enforcement of such modification is sought.\n(b) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Newfoundland, Canada applicable to contracts made and to be wholly performed within such state, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof. The Federal and state courts located in Newfoundland, Canada, shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement.\n(c) Any failure by either party to enforce the other party\u2019s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n(d) Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any such restriction is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was not included.\n(e) Any notices or communications required or permitted to be given hereunder may be delivered by hand, deposited with a nationally recognized overnight carrier, electronic-mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case, to the address of the other party first indicated above (or such other addressee as may be furnished by a party in accordance with this paragraph).
