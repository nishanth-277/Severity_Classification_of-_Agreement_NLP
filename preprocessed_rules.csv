The Earth monitoring competition Copernicus Masters aims to support the development of market-oriented applications based on Earth observation data. In 2017, the Copernicus Masters is again enriched by the Copernicus Accelerator, a European Commission programme. Through this initiative, the 50 best finalists of the Copernicus Masters, selected by an international expert panel will automatically be granted access to a business coaching scheme provided by high-level professionals, that will act as mentors. To actively participate in the Copernicus Accelerator programme, Mentor commits to the following Non-Disclosure-Agreement and Terms of Participation.\n1 Eligibility\nMentor is a resident of one of the Copernicus participating countries1 or is employed with a legal identity registered in the territory of one of the Copernicus participating countries, willing to support and help develop the Ideas of the finalists of the Copernicus Masters 2017 (hereinafter \u201cParticipants\u201d). Professionals who pursue becoming mentors need to apply via the dedicated platform, inserting all required details, which can be edited anytime by Mentor. Their request needs to be validated by the Organiser and the European Commission, who can refuse participation in case of non-eligibility or conflict of interest. After verification of all details entered, the Organiser will notify the Mentor about the outcome of his/her submission.\nEven after validation, the Organiser cannot guarantee that there will be an actual match between Mentor and Participants. Mentor confirms that Mentor has not been involved in the development of any of the Ideas to be coached at any stage and that Mentor has no personal or commercial connection to any Participant of the Copernicus Accelerator that would influence an objective development of Ideas.\n1 The Copernicus Participating countries include all the EU Member States, in addition to Norway and Iceland.\n2 Procedure and Terms of Participation\nThe Copernicus Accelerator programme is comprised of different phases, for a total coaching support of approximately one year, aimed at helping Participants\u00b4 Ideas achieving measurable results. When submitting the request to become Mentor, Mentor needs to specify in which fields he/she can support Participants, in order to allow a suitable matchmaking with the requests and needs communicated by Participants.\nWhen a Mentor is requested by a Participant of the programme, he/she can access the Participant's profile and examine the submitted idea, in order to decide whether to confirm the request or not. Mentors can only advise up to two participants.\nMentors will meet the Participants at the Accelerator Bootcamp, that will take place in line with the Awards Ceremony of the Copernicus Masters, the European Satellite Navigation Competition (ESNC), and the accompanying Satellite Masters Conference from 6 - 8 November 2017 in Tallinn, Estonia. Mentor\u00b4s participation to this event is mandatory, as it will set forth the official start of their relationship: Mentor and Participants will begin developing a coaching plan together, that will include objectives and KPIs of their affiliation.\nMonthly virtual interactions need to be planned by Mentor, to ensure a continuous acceleration of the Participants Ideas\u00b4 towards business maturity. A mid-term review and survey will be required by April 2018, to evaluate progress made and ensure that the recommendations of the coaching plan are currently implemented by Participants. In case of a non-positive matching or non-compliance to his/her assigned duties (having monthly interactions with the mentees, keeping contacts with the Copernicus Accelerator team, promptly informing the organizers about any relevant issue connected to the coaching relationship), Mentor may be replaced by a more suitable candidate for the Participants\u00b4 needs.\nMentor will actively support Participants until July 2018, and will then submit a final report together, detailing the outcome of the coaching experience. The Organiser will continuously monitor all relationships, in order to assist both parties and guarantee a positive outcome of the programme. Mentor needs to deliver all requested reports and schedule all requested meetings. The Organiser will provide Mentor with templates for the documents to be produced. Mentors and Participants will meet again at the closing bootcamp, held in October/November 2018, that will official seal the closing of their mentoring relationship.\nAt the end of the coaching service, Mentor will fill in a questionnaire on the coaching service and the overall experience and will also be subject to a specific questionnaire compiled by Participants.\n3 Payment\nThe Organiser will reimburse Mentor the travel arrangements and accommodation for the Acceleration Bootcamp in Tallinn in 2017 (a maximum of EUR 800) and the closing bootcamp in 2018 (a maximum of EUR 700). The coaching service provided by Mentor is worth a maximum fee of EUR 5,000 (VAT excluded) per Participant coached, that will be remunerated to Mentor at the end of the programme, after the submission and approval of the final summary report of the coaching relationships. Payment shall be made within 30 days from the receipt of invoice, and following the invoice verification by Organiser. No deductions will be made from the gross fees paid to mentor who shall be solely responsible for ensuring that all and any Government taxes and other deductions are paid by him/her.\n4 Definition of Confidential Information\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any Idea disclosed to Mentor, all data and information, know-how, business concepts, software, procedures, products, services, development projects, and programmes contained in such Idea and/or its description and any conclusions. Confidential Information does not include:\n> information already known or independently developed by Mentor prior to the disclosure of any Idea;\n> information already in the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor; or\n> information received from a third party who was free to disclose such information.\nIn case of doubt any information is deemed to be Confidential Information unless Mentor proves that such information is not confidential.\n5 Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information / Obligations of Mentor\nMentor shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to review, assess and help develop the Participants\u00b4 Ideas.\nMentor shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party or to Mentor\u2019s employees and/or employer without the prior written consent of the Participants. Mentor shall require his/her employees who will have access to Confidential Information to commit to a non-disclosure agreement that protects the Confidential Information to at least the same degree as this Agreement. Mentor shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of, and avoid any unauthorised disclosure or use of Confidential Information. Such measures shall include the highest degree of care that Mentor utilises to protect Mentor\u2019s own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than reasonable care.\nNotwithstanding Mentor\u2019s right to assess and rate the Ideas of the Participants, Mentor shall not use the Confidential information for his/her own or third parties purposes and shall not file for any intellectual property right protection for the Confidential Information or parts of it.\nMentor shall notify Organiser immediately in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of any Confidential Information that may come to Mentor\u2019s attention. Mentor agrees to segregate all Confidential Information relating to this agreement from Confidential Information of others to avoid commingling.\n6 Discontinuation of Use, Return of Materials\nAt Organiser\u2019s first request, Mentor shall:\n(a) discontinue all use of Confidential Information;\n(b) return to Organiser and/or Participants all materials furnished by Organiser and/or Participants that contain Confidential Information;\n(c) destroy any copy and all materials produced by and under control of Organiser and/or Participants that contain Confidential Information;\n(d) erase and/or destroy any Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus of, under control of or used by Mentor;\n(e) remove the Confidential Information from any software or data base of, under control of/or used by Mentor that incorporates or uses the Confidential Information in whole or in part; and\n(f) warrant in writing to Organiser, within ten (10) days after Organiser\u2019s request, that Mentor has taken all actions set out under (a) through (e) in this Clause 4.\n7 Notice of Required Disclosure\nIf Mentor is required by mandatory, non-appealable judicial or administrative process and/or order to disclose Confidential Information, then Mentor shall promptly notify Organiser and allow Organiser and the Participants reasonable time to oppose such process unless this is not admissible under a mandatory law, judicial or administrative order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mentor shall disclose Confidential Information only to the minimum extent required to comply with such order.\n8 Proprietary Rights, Limited Right to Use\nAny and all proprietary rights, including but not limited to rights to and in inventions, patent rights, utility models, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, in and to any Confidential Information shall be and remain with the Participants respectively, and Mentor shall not have any right, license, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information, except the limited right to review, assess and help develop such Confidential Information in connection with the Copernicus Accelerator 2017.\n9 Term\nThis Agreement shall be effective as of 2 May 2017 and may not be terminated except for important cause. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, any Confidential Information must be kept confidential for as long as such Confidential Information is not publicly known unless it becomes part of the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor. This agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both parties.\n10 Governing Law\nThis Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by the material laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n11 Jurisdiction\nThe place of jurisdiction for any and all legal disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement is Munich (Landgericht M\u00fcnchen I). Imperative places of jurisdiction under German Law shall remain unaffected by the foregoing.\n12 Notification of Unauthorised Use\nMentor shall notify Organiser immediately upon discovery of any unauthorised use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Mentor, and will cooperate with\nOrganiser in every reasonable way to help Organiser regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorised use or publication.\n13 Remedies\nMentor acknowledges that his/her obligations under this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the Ideas and the Confidential Information. Each party further acknowledges that any breach by Mentor of Mentor\u2019s covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or threatened violation of such may cause irreparable injury to Organiser and to Participants.\n14 Miscellaneous\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon Organiser and Mentor, and their successors and assigns. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both\nof the parties.\nThe failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this Agreement.\nMentor is aware that an unauthorised disclosure of the Ideas and of the assessment and development of the Ideas and of any Confidential Information may lead to serious damage to Participants and the Organiser of the Copernicus Accelerator 2017. This Agreement shall be for the benefit of the Participants.\nThe Organiser and the European Commission will use the Mentor\u00b4s contact information to inform him/her of all matters related to the Copernicus Accelerator 2017 and of any other issues the Organiser and the European Commission deem relevant and appropriate.

NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT: Both parties recognizes and acknowledges that, in an effort to foster the Discussions one or both of the parties has provided and/or will provide, at no cost, fee, charge or expense to Receiving Party, Confidential Information of a special and unique value and nature developed and/or acquired by (and/or being developed or acquired by) Originating Party at great expense and cost to Originating Party which, if it were to come into the possession of Originating Party\u2019s competitors, would cause irreparable damage to Originating Party, its competitive advantage and its ability to operate profitably. Receiving Party acknowledges that, prior to its relationship with Originating Party and prior to execution of this Agreement, Receiving Party had no knowledge of any of the aforesaid information. Receiving Party therefore agrees that neither it nor its Representatives will at any time make any independent business or personal use of, retain, copy, divulge, disclose, reveal or communicate to any other person or organization (except as expressly authorized in writing by Originating Party, as required to analyze the Business Relationship or as required to fulfill Receiving Party\u2019s obligations to Originating Party) any Confidential Information. Both parties agree that the obligations under this Agreement are in addition to all duties and obligations imposed upon each party by operation of law including but not limited to common-law and statute. Both parties further agree that their obligations under this paragraph survive the termination of the relationship between the two parties.\nIII. LEGALLY REQUIRED DISCLOSURES: If Receiving Party is requested to disclose any Confidential Information of the Originating Party under applicable law, in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or in response to a formal request of a regulatory or governmental authority (including law enforcement), then, except as otherwise required to comply with applicable law, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Originating Party of such request so that Originating Party may resist such disclosure or seek an appropriate protective order, and shall provide all information and assistance reasonably requested by Originating Party in connection therewith, at the Originating Party\u2019s sole expense.

NO REVERSE ENGINEERING; WORK PRODUCT: Receiving Party shall not reverse-engineer, analyze, attempt to duplicate or otherwise attempt to determine the design or method of compiling samples, prototypes or products of the Originating Party except pursuant to a mutually acceptable, written agreement executed by the parties. In the event that Receiving Party performs any services or testing for or on behalf of Originating Party without entering into such a written agreement, then any information or data developed by Receiving Party in connection with such services or tests shall be considered the Originating Party\u2019s Confidential Information and shall be maintained as such and kept confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. All such information and data shall belong to Originating Party exclusively and Receiving Party shall execute any instruments determined by Originating Party to be reasonably necessary to confirm Originating Party\u2019s ownership thereof.\nV. NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES AND/OR CONTRACTORS: Receiving Party recognizes and acknowledges that, while engaged in Discussions and/or while involved in a Business Relationship, such party will be in a position to utilize Originating Party\u2019s goodwill and have access to and/or utilize Confidential Information of Originating Party that would enable Receiving Party to take advantage of that goodwill and/or Confidential Information to the detriment of the Originating Party, by attempting, for example, to recruit or solicit employees, and/or contractors of Originating Party. Receiving Party agrees and acknowledges that this would have the effect of causing the cessation or curtailment of the Business Relationship and would otherwise unfairly damage the business prospects of Originating Party. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual agreements made in this Agreement, during the course of the Business Relationship and for a period of 36 months after termination of the Business Relationship, Receiving Party agrees not to directly or indirectly communicate, solicit, induce, hire, recruit, take away, employ, endeavor to employ (on Receiving Party\u2019s own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity) or attempt to influence any employee or contractor in any way that may have the effect of causing the cessation or curtailment of their respective relationships with Originating Party.\nVI.

ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLOSER DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nVII. ATTORNEY'S FEES: If any legal action is brought by any party hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in such action or dispute shall be entitled to recover from the other party attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other relief that may be awarded. For the purpose of this Paragraph, the \""prevailing party\"" shall be the party in whose favor a final judgment is entered.\nVIII. SEVERABILITY: It is the intent and agreement of the parties to this agreement that, in case any one or more of the provisions of this agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this agreement and this agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein except that this shall not prohibit any modification allowed or agreed upon pursuant to the terms of this agreement or any right of reformation.\nIX. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the procedural and substantive laws of the State of Missouri. The parties to this Agreement consent and designate St. Louis County, Missouri as the sole venue and location for any suit or other proceeding of any kind regarding any aspect of this agreement and all issues arising out of or relating to the independent relationship between the parties.\nX. ASSIGNMENT: This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and the assigns of all parties herein. Each party may assign or transfer this Agreement to a successor business entity in the event of a merger, consolidation, transfer or sale of the assets of said party. Any purported assignment of this Agreement, other than as provided above, shall be void.\nXI. NOTICES: Except as expressly set forth to the contrary in this Agreement, all notices, requests, consents or other communications (each a \""Notice\"") provided for or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and must be given either (i) by depositing the Notice in the United States mail, addressed to the recipient, postage paid, and registered or certified with return receipt requested or (ii) by delivering the Notice to the recipient in person, by courier, or by facsimile transmission. A Notice given under this Agreement is effective on receipt by the party to receive it. Any Notice to any party must be sent to or made at that party\u2019s address (or facsimile number if applicable) given below such party\u2019s signature or such other address or facsimile number as that party may specify by delivering a Notice in compliance with this paragraph.\nXII. EQUITABLE RELIEF: Each party recognizes that any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the other party, the extent of which would be difficult and impracticable to assess, and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for such breach. Accordingly, in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedies at law or in equity available under the circumstances, and notwithstanding any jurisdiction and venue requirements of this Agreement, each party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other non-monetary equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need or requirement of any bond, provided that if a bond is required, the bond shall not exceed $1,000.00.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties, intending to be legally bound, have executed this Agreement as of the last date set forth below by the undersigned duly authorized representatives.\nDealer Pay, LLC ________________________________(Company)\nPO Box 1691\n________________________________(Street Address)\nSt. Charles, MO 63302\n________________________________(City, State, Zip)\nJulie R.

The Parties shall only be bound to a business relationship by way of further definitive written agreements signed by the Parties.\n3.2. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as \u2013\n3.2.1. prohibiting either Party from entering into a business relationship with any Third Party;\n3.2.2. creating a joint venture, partnership or employment relationship between the Parties and neither Party shall have the right, power or implied authority to create any obligation or duty (express, implied or otherwise) on behalf of the other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall oblige either of the Parties to enter into any agreements or transactions whatsoever.\n4. INTERPRETATION\n4.1. The Party disclosing Confidential Information shall be known as \""the Disclosing Party\"" and the Party receiving Confidential Information shall be known as \""the Receiving Party\"".\n4.2. The headings of the clauses of this Agreement are used for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or construction of the contents of this Agreement.\n5. THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\""Confidential Information\"" shall include, without limitation, any \u2013\n5.1. technical, commercial or financial information;\n5.2. know-how and trade secrets;\n5.3. processes, machinery, designs, drawings, technical specifications and data relating to the Project;\n5.4. any of the above information of third parties, including but not limited to supplier and customer information relating to the Project,\nin whatever form and which relates to the Disclosing Party's business practices or promotion of the Disclosing Party's business plans, policies or practices, and which information is either communicated to or otherwise acquired by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party during the course of the Parties' discussions with one another, whether or not such information is formally designated as confidential.\n6.

The Disclosing Party shall be obliged only to disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party to the extent deemed necessary by the Disclosing Party in its discretion for the purposes of the Project.\n6.2. The Parties acknowledge that Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement is a valuable and unique asset proprietary to the Disclosing Party.\n6.3. Subject to 6.5, the Receiving Party agrees that it will not, during the existence of this Agreement disclose the Confidential Information to any Third Party for any reason or purpose whatsoever, without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party and only to the extent of such consent, save in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In this Agreement \""Third Party\"" means any party who is not a signatory to this agreement.\n6.4.

The parties hereto are entering into this Agreement to ensure the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n2. Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees not to videotape, photograph or otherwise record any Confidential Information. The Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third parties other than to its affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants or professional advisers (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who have a need to know the Confidential Information for use in evaluating or pursuing a potential business relationship with Disclosing Party or its affiliates (\u201cPermitted Use.\u201d) Recipient will, and will cause its Representatives to (i) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence, in a manner consistent with the protections it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, and in any event no less than a reasonable standard of care and in strict accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and (ii) use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for no purpose other than the Permitted Use. Recipient shall remain liable for any failure by its Representatives to comply with the terms of this Agreement. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any non-public information disclosed by Disclosing Party to Recipient, either directly or indirectly in writing, orally, visually or by inspection of tangible objects in connection with the Meeting and related discussions or the Permitted Use (including, without limitation, research, product plans, products, services, equipment, customers, markets, software, inventions, discoveries, ideas, processes, designs, drawings, hardware, formulations, specifications, product configuration information, product components, marketing and finance documents, prototypes, samples, data sets, and equipment), whether or not designated as \u201cconfidential\u201d at the time of disclosure.\n3. Limitations. The obligations of the Recipient specified in Section 2 above shall not apply with respect to Confidential Information to the extent that such Confidential Information: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public without any act or omission on the part of the Recipient or its Representatives; (b) is in the Recipient\u2019s lawful possession at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (c) is or becomes known to the Recipient through disclosure by an unaffiliated third party (except where such third party is known by the Recipient to be disclosing such information in breach of obligations of confidence); or (d) is independently developed by or for the Recipient by persons who have had no access to or been informed of the existence or substance of the Confidential Information. It shall not be a breach of this Agreement for the Recipient to disclose Confidential Information if required to do so under law or in a judicial, arbitral, or governmental proceeding or investigation, provided, (i) the Disclosing Party has been given reasonable prior notice to allow it the option to take actions to protect its interest and Recipient shall cooperate with any reasonable requests of the Disclosing Party in connection thereof, including any protective orders or other safeguards sought by the Disclosing Party; and (ii) the Recipient only discloses that portion of the Confidential Information (with a full copy to the Disclosing Party) required to be disclosed and shall preserve the confidentiality of all other Confidential Information.\n4. Ownership of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to grant the Recipient any license, right, title, or interest in or to the Confidential Information. The Recipient acquires no intellectual property license or rights under this Agreement except the limited right to review such Confidential Information. Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure of any Confidential Information hereunder shall result in any obligation on the part of either party to enter into any further agreement with the other or to require Disclosing Party to disclose any particular or further Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement creates or shall be deemed to create any employment, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties.\n5. Injunctive Relief.

Amendment and Construction. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by written instrument executed by both parties hereto. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same document. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, such provision will be changed or interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the Agreement within the limits of applicable law. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.\n9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. The parties agree that any representation, warranty or condition, written or otherwise, not expressly contained in this Agreement or in an authorized written amendment thereto shall not be enforceable by any party.\n10. Term. The confidentiality obligations contained in this Agreement expire and are of no further force or effect five (5) years from last date that Confidential Information was disclosed under this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties hereto have executed this Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date first set forth above.\nEVELOZCITY RECIPIENT\nBy: __________________________ By:

Confidential Information. It is contemplated that Confidential Information (as defined herein) will be transferred from Discloser to Recipient in connection herewith and that Confidential Information shall be used by Recipient only for purposes of evaluating whether it might have interest in discussing Business Opportunities with Recipient.\na. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any proprietary information belonging to Discloser relating to: (i) Discloser\u2019s proprietary technology, systems, service offering and products, including without limitation, plans and specifications, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product plans, ideas or concepts, services, software, inventions, intellectual property rights, techniques, processes, developments, algorithms, formulas, technology, designs, schematics, drawings, engineering, and hardware configuration information (collectively referred to as \u201cTechnical Information\u201d); and (ii) proprietary information relating to the financial information of any of the principals of Discloser, Discloser\u2019s corporate financial information or its operations and business or financial plans or strategies, including but not limited to its identity, customers, customer lists, markets, real estate development plans, financial statements and projections, products, product pricing and marketing, financial or other strategic business plans or information (collectively referred to as \u201cBusiness Information\u201d), disclosed to Recipient by Discloser, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of samples, equipment or facilities. For purposes of this agreement, Confidential Information shall be assumed to be of a confidential and/or proprietary nature by Recipient, as it is reasonable to assume and expect that said Business Information is highly relevant to the success of its Discloser\u2019s business and is not known to the public.\nb. The restrictions set forth herein shall not apply with respect to information designated by Discloser as Confidential which: (i) is known by Recipient at the time of receipt as evidenced by Recipient\u2019s records; (ii) is or becomes a part of the public domain without breach of the Agreement by Recipient; (iii) is obtained by Recipient from a third party under conditions permitting its disclosure to others; (iv) is independently developed by Recipient; or (v) is disclosed by Recipient pursuant to judicial action or Government regulations provided Recipient notifies Discloser prior to such disclosure and cooperates with Discloser in the event Discloser elects to legally contest and avoid such disclosure.\n2. Identification of Confidential Information. For the purpose of the Agreement, written Business or Technical Information (including that which is delivered electronically) that is considered to be Confidential Information by Discloser, shall be so marked by Discloser. Information that is furnished orally shall be considered Confidential Information if Discloser so indicates. Additionally, information furnished by Discloser shall be deemed Confidential Information if it is obvious from its content, in the context under which it is furnished.\n3. Subsequent Notice of Confidentiality. Discloser may give notice in writing that written or verbal information that has been previously furnished, but not declared confidential, is in fact confidential. This information is to be treated as Confidential Information by Recipient from the time of receipt of said notice. That being said, Recipient shall make every reasonable effort to mark all written copies of such information under its control as \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d and to make every reasonable effort to inform Discloser of any disclosures by Recipient to third parties of such information that may have occurred between the time of receipt of the information and receipt by Recipient of notice that such information is confidential. Recipient has no responsibility to attempt to control the use of such information by such a third party.\n4. Term, Non-Disclosure and Use. For a period of two (2) years from the date of receipt, all Confidential Information shall be maintained in confidence by Recipient, shall not be disclosed, published, communicated, divulged or revealed in any manner, to any other person, firm, corporation or other third party entity, including employees of Recipient who do not have a need to know, or who should not know any such details pertaining to Confidential Information in the course of their employment, except as may otherwise provided in this Agreement. Recipient further affirmatively agrees not to use any Confidential Information received from Discloser except for the express purposes set forth herein.\n5. No License Granted. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not be construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or implicitly, any rights or licenses to Recipient, by the furnishing of Confidential Information by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement.\n6. Ownership and Return of Confidential Information. All tangible information, including drawings, specifications and other information furnished hereunder shall remain the property of Discloser. Upon request, or if either party elects not to pursue any further business undertaking with the other, Recipient shall promptly return all tangible information, including any and all copies or partial copies thereof and thereupon confirm destruction of all information held electronically.\n7. No Warranty. No warranty or representation is made by Discloser that any information transmitted by it hereunder is true and correct, patentable or copyrightable, or that any such information involves concepts or embodiments that are free of infringement of other rights.\n8. Equitable Relief. Discloser and Recipient agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to measure and calculate Discloser\u2019s damages from any breach of the covenants set forth herein, especially with regard any breach associated with Confidential Information that was to be maintained behind the Information Barrier. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, Discloser will have available, in addition to any other right or remedy available, the right to obtain an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and to specific performance of any such provision of this Agreement. Recipient further agrees that no bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and that Recipient hereby consents to the issuance of such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance. If any action or proceeding is brought to enforce this Agreement because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, should it prevail, Discloser shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in such action or proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.\n9. Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective as of date hereof and shall terminate upon the express written termination by either one of the parties hereto. Termination of the Agreement shall not relieve either party of any obligation set forth in Paragraphs 4 or 6 with respect to Confidential Information, and all such obligations shall continue until expiration of the period set 10. General Provisions. The following general provisions shall apply:\n(a) Governing Law: This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n(b) Severability: If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\n(c) Successors and Assigns: This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the parties hereto.\n(d) Headings. All headings used herein are intended for reference purposes only and shall not affect the interpretation, or validity of this Agreement.\n(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Any amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of either the Discloser or Recipient.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto acknowledge that they have read and understand each and every term of this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions, and agree that the effective date of this Agreement is as set forth herein.\nRECIPIENT:\n________________________________\nName: __________________________\nTitle: __________________________\nPlease send to: msilvers@flixbrewhouse.com\n"",","nondisclosure,

Company further agrees to return Confidential Information to FNHA, if FNHA so directs, or to destroy Confidential Information once the RFP process completes or earlier of FNHA so directs.\nThis Agreement does not preclude discussions of Confidential Information between the undersigned and FNHA staff or with any other persons identified by FNHA as having undertaken this Agreement.\nThis Agreement does not preclude discussions of Confidential Information between the undersigned and other persons , if expressly permitted by staff of FNHA and those discussions are conducted on the terms and conditions that FNHA may direct.\n3.

FNHA acknowledges that any Confidential Information provided may be subject to review pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act or any provincial legislation, regulations or policies that may affect such information.\n4. Equitable Relief. Company acknowledges that all of the Confidential Information is owned solely by FNHA and that the unauthorized disclosure or use of such Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm and significant injury, the degree of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Company agrees that FNHA will have the right to obtain an immediate injunction enjoining any breach of this Agreement, as well as the right to pursue any and all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity for such a breach.\n5.

Definition.\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means, in respect to each Party:\n(a) any information in which such Party claims a proprietary and/or confidential interest;\n(b) all confidential matters of such Party including, without limitation, technical know-how, trade secrets, technical data, new product strategy, new products or processes, analysis, compilations, concepts, technical processes, formulae, recipes, specifications, inventions, research projects, customer lists, pricing, pricing policies, operational methods, financial information, marketing information and other business affairs;\n(c) any information of a confidential nature concerning such Party\u2019s customers, suppliers or employees; and\n(d) any information such Party has received from others which they are obliged to treat as proprietary and/or confidential.\nThe Confidential Information of either Party includes all of the above information with respect to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such Party.\nConfidential Information shall not include information which: (a) is in the public domain prior to the date of its disclosure to Recipient by the Disclosing Party; (b) is known and can be shown to be known by Recipient prior to the date of its disclosure to Recipient by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, and is not the result of any unauthorized act or omission on the part of Recipient; (d) can be demonstrated to have been supplied to Recipient by a third party who is under no obligation to the Disclosing Party to maintain such information in confidence; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without the use of the Confidential Information.\n2. Obligation of Confidence. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information constitutes valuable information, and the provisions of this Agreement are necessary to protect the secrecy and confidentiality thereof.\n(a) Recipient shall (i) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and take all reasonable steps to prevent its disclosure to third parties; (ii) use at least the same degree of care as Recipient uses in maintaining the secrecy of its own Confidential Information (but no less than a reasonable degree of care); and (iii) prevent the removal of any proprietary, confidential or copyright notices placed on the Confidential Information.\n(b) Recipient may use the Confidential Information only in connection with the performance of the Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor. Recipient shall not, at any time, make any use of the Confidential Information for any other purpose.\n(c) Recipient shall keep the Confidential Information confidential at all times and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any person including its employees except to its employees, representatives, advisors and agents who have a need to know such information in connection with assisting Recipient for the purposes set forth in paragraph 2(b) above and who are required to keep such information confidential.\n(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 2, Recipient may disclose to Principals, on whose behalf it is performing Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor, and who have a need to know the Confidential Information provided that: (i) Distributor has been notified of the identity of such Principals and has agreed to the disclosure of Confidentiality Agreement under this Section 2(d), (ii) only the necessary portions of Confidential Information required by such Principals to evaluate and utilize the Agency Sales and Marketing Services is disclosed, and (iii) Principal has a Confidentiality Agreement in place with Distributor or has a Confidentiality Agreement acceptable to Distributor in place with Recipient.\n3. Return of Materials and Information. All Documents made available hereunder, including all copies, notes, summaries, and abstracts thereof, shall be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed upon completion of the Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor or upon written request by the Disclosing Party, and Recipient shall certify in writing that it has complied with the provisions of this Agreement.\n4. Opportunity to Seek Protective Order. In the event Recipient is requested or required by applicable law, regulation or legal process (including a subpoena or other administrative or judicial request), to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party so that it may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Unless the demand shall have been timely limited, quashed or extended, Recipient shall thereafter be entitled to comply with such demand to the extent required by law. If requested by the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall provide reasonable cooperation (at the expense of the Disclosing Party) in the defense of a demand to disclose Confidential Information.\n5. Patent, Copyright or Trademark Infringement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any new or additional rights under any patent, copyright or trademark, nor shall this Agreement grant the Parties any new or additional rights in or to the Confidential Information, except the limited right to review and use such Confidential Information for the purpose outlined herein.\n6. Ownership. As between the Parties, all Confidential Information shall remain the property of the FSMA\nDisclosing Party. Recipient agrees not to assert any claim of ownership to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or any portion thereof. Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parties to share any Confidential Information with the other, and the Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.\n7. Injunctive Relief. It is understood and agreed that damages are an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by any Party under this Agreement and that any such breach by any party will cause irreparable harm, injury and damage; accordingly, the Parties agree that the damaged party may be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies (including monetary damages) otherwise available to it at law, or in equity, or by statute, to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by any Party.\n8. Survival. The foregoing obligations of all Parties shall continue for a period of two (2) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, unless a specific portion of the Confidential Information disclosed becomes generally known to the public before the expiration of such two (2) year period through no fault of the Receiving Party. However, with respect to trade secrets, such obligations will survive for so long as such Confidential Information constitutes a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n9. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF THE PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS OF DISTRIBUTOR AS SET FORTH IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ABOVE (REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW) AS TO ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MATTERS OF VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT, PERFORMANCE AND REMEDY. The county in which the principal place of business of Distributor is located as set forth in the first paragraph above and the closest state or federal court to the principal place of business of Agency shall each be a proper (but not exclusive) place of venue for any suits to enforce this Agreement, and any legal proceedings to enforce the provisions hereof may be brought in the state or federal Court sitting in such county or the closest state or federal court to the principal place of business of Agency. Each Party hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such court lacks jurisdiction over it, and agrees not to plead or claim, in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement brought in any of the aforesaid courts, that any such court lacks jurisdiction over it or that such court is located in an inconvenient forum.\n10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, between the Parties with respect thereto. Any modification, rescission or amendment of this Agreement shall not be effective unless made in a writing executed by both Parties. In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) had never been contained herein, provided that such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) shall first be curtailed, reformed, limited or eliminated to the extent necessary to remove such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability with respect to the applicable law as it shall then be applied. Any waiver of, or promise not to enforce, any right under this Agreement shall not be enforceable unless evidenced by a writing signed by the party making said waiver or promise. The undersigned each represents that it has been duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, including facsimile copies, but such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.\nDISTRIBUTOR: ___________________ AGENCY: ________________________________\nBy: ___________________________ By:

Exclusions from Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 1, Confidential Information does not include information which (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives; or (ii) was or becomes available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than PHCS, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with PHCS or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Recipient; or (iii) was within the Recipient\u2019s possession prior to its being furnished by or on behalf of PHCS, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with PHCS in respect thereof or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Recipient.\n3.

As a condition to the disclosure of the Confidential Information, the Recipient agrees to keep the Confidential Information confidential and not to disclose or otherwise use the Confidential Information for any purpose, other than for its business relationship with PHCS, without the prior written consent of PHCS. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees to treat the Confidential Information which it receives as it would its own confidential information and to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized disclosure to any third party of any Confidential Information.

Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event that the Recipient or its Representatives are requested or become legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, request for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or take any other action prohibited hereby, the Recipient shall provide PHCS with prompt written notice so that PHCS may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not sought or obtained or that the compliance with the provisions of this Agreement is waived, the Recipient agrees that it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in the reasonable opinion of its counsel, the Recipient is compelled to disclose without standing liable for contempt or suffering other censure or penalty.

A party making information available to the other, reserves the right to register its own protective rights with regard to the subject of such information.\n\u00a7 7 Coming into Force and Duration\nThe agreement comes into force at such time as the last party signs the agreement. Any duties under this agreement seize to exist five years after the coming into force thereof.\n\u00a7 8 Legal Relationships Existing Outside this Agreement\nNo employment or similar contract exists between the university and the student but a relationship governed by examination regulations. Thus the university does not have the right to impose a duty of confidentiality upon the student. The university is not liable for the student\u2019s compliance with any bilateral confidentiality agreements between student and company.\n\u00a7 9 Other\nOral agreement will be considered null and void. Any additions or amendments to this contract have to be in writing. The formal requirement can only be waived in writing.

PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT\nThe Parties to this Agreement desire to engage in discussions regarding present and/or potential future business relationships.

Therefore, the Parties hereby agree that they are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.\nThe Parties both believe, and hereby agree, that Confidential Information has significant commercial value that would be diminished by unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, the commitments of confidentiality in this Agreement are a condition to the Parties\u2019 willingness to engage in the contemplated business discussions and planning.\nThe Parties agree that they shall not use any advantages derivable from such information in its own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement with all other signatories to this document.

This identification shall be by way of formal correspondence (letter, fax or email) addressed to the other Party outlining the proposed information to be disclosed (without giving specific details), requesting the receiving Party to recognise this as Confidential Information and therefore being bound by this Agreement. The receiving Party has the right to accept the information under this Agreement or to decline the information in which case it will not be provided.\n3. OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY\nThe Parties agree that when receipt of any Confidential Information has occurred:\n3a.

The receiving Party shall reasonably protect the Confidential Information with not less than the same degree of care exercised by its own personnel to protect its own, or publication of its own, most valuable confidential and proprietary information.\n4. OBLIGATION OF NON-COMPETITION\nThe non-competition provisions of this Agreement are an essential and material part of the total agreement, by which the Parties agree they shall not use any advantages derivable from such confidential information in their own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement executed by all signatories to this document.\n5. NON-CIRCUMVENTION\nThe Parties hereby agree on behalf of themselves, their officers, directors, agents, associates and any related parties, that they will not, directly or indirectly, contact, deal with or otherwise become involved with any entity or any other entities or parties introduced, directly or indirectly, by or through the other party, its officers, directors, agents or associates, for the purpose of avoiding the payment to the other Party of profits, fees or other amounts, without the specific written approval of the other Party.\n6. NO REPRESENTATIONS\nThe Parties both understand that each Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information it provides. The Parties both agree that neither Party, nor any of its advisers, representatives, agents, or employees shall be held liable for utilization of Confidential Information which results from the other Party\u2019s use of said information.\n7.

Hereinafter such parties may be addressed individually as the \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the Parties have been engaged in and/or expect to further engage in confidential written and oral communications (\u201cConfidential Communications\u201d) relating to the business affairs of the HNBA;\nWHEREAS, it is expected that Confidential Communications may involve the disclosure by or on behalf of the HNBA of information not in the public domain, including, but not limited to, business and financial information, membership lists, personal information concerning candidates for judicial or other government office provided by the candidates or other third parties, drawings, samples, devices, demonstrations, computer programs, analyses, studies, compilations, and other date, and proprietary and novel features contained in any of the foregoing, as well as communications that may be protected by the Attorney-Client and/or Attorney Work Product Privileges (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to define their rights with respect to Confidential Information delivered to the other Party;\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises, it is agreed as follows:\n1. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall include:\n(a) All information that is delivered by or on behalf of the HNBA to the Board Member in written, graphic or electronic form and that is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary;\u201d\n(a) Any information, whether in oral, written, graphic, electronic, machine readable or any other form, that is provided to the Board Member by or on behalf of the HNBA in connection with the Board Member\u2019s performance of his or her duties as an HNBA Board Member and that is not otherwise readily available to the public, including membership lists, financial reports, personnel evaluations, program plans and reports, memoranda, e-mail and communications related to HNBA business \u2013 whether originated by an HNBA member or not, and communications that may be protected by the Attorney-Client Privilege or the Attorney Work Product Doctrine;\n(c) Written and spoken information provided to the Board Member in the performance of his or her duty to evaluate prospective nominees for judicial or executive office who have requested the support of the HNBA, including but not limited to (1) completed questionnaires and any other data furnished by the candidate or third parties to the HNBA; (ii) confidential information gathered by the Board Member or told to the Board Member during any investigation or evaluation of any candidate being considered for endorsement; (iii) conversation, colloquy, deliberations, evaluations, and conclusions concerning a prospective nominee expressed during the evaluation or consideration of the candidates\u2019 qualifications or endorsement request; and (iv) the decision of any committee or the Board of Governors concerning whether a prospective nominee is qualified for appointment; and\n(b) Any personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number, e-mail address or any combination thereof provided by or on behalf of the HNBA to the Board Member.\n2. All Confidential Information shall be subject to the restrictions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount, type, and items of Confidential Information disclosed by the HNBA shall be solely within its discretion and it may refuse to disclose information if it believes that it is not in its best interests to do so. In addition, while the HNBA will exercise its best effort to ensure that all Confidential Information it provides to Board Member is accurate and complete, the HNBA makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information disclosed. The information may be redacted when the Candidate or third party places restrictions on further disclosure of the information.\n1. The Board Member agrees that the Confidential Information he or she receives shall be used solely for the benefit of the HNBA Board Work, and that all rights to the proprietary and novel features contained in the Confidential Information are reserved by the disclosing Party. The Board Member will not use or disclose Confidential Information to any third party for any purpose other than the performance of his or her duties as a Board Member of the HNBA unless and until the HNBA expressly authorizes the disclosure in writing. Board Member specifically agrees not to use any personally identifiable information provided by or on behalf of the HNBA, its contractors, affiliates, vendors, sponsors or employees, for any direct marketing and not to transfer such information to any third party.\n2.

The Board Member agrees that no license under any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right is granted by implication or otherwise to Board Members under this Agreement.\n1. Once the purpose of the disclosure is achieved, the HNBA will instruct the Board Member to destroy all Confidential Information supplied to the Board Member by the HNBA. The HNBA will keep a copy in its files for a period of two (2) years after the completion of each Candidate\u2019s specific request.\n2. The Agreement shall expire five (5) years from its effective date specified above unless earlier terminated by a Party by giving the other Party thirty (30) days written notice. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not relieve the Board Member of any obligation with respect to the Confidential Information disclosed or developed hereunder prior to termination.\n3. This Agreement embodies all the understandings between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and merges all prior discussions and writing between them as to confidentiality of Confidential Information. Neither Party shall be bound by any conditions, warranties nor representations with respect to confidentiality of Confidential Information other than as expressly provided in this Agreement.\n4. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and both of which together shall constitute one and the same instruments.\n11. In addition to all other legal rights and remedies the disclosing Party may have upon a breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party, the disclosing Party shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief respecting the covenants contained herein, and the receiving Party expressly waives the defense that a remedy in damages will be adequate. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that the prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to full recovery of its attorneys\u2019 fees.\n5. No failures of delay by the disclosing Party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right or privilege hereunder.\nBoth parties signify their agreement to the above terms by signing or causing their authorized representatives to sign this Agreement effective as of the date specified in the opening paragraph of this Agreement.\nON BEHALF OF THE HISPANIC HNBA BOARD MEMBER\nNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION\nErica V.

Remedies\nVendor acknowledges that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that IBC shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bonds.\nVendor agrees to defend any and all Claims that may be brought or alleged against IBC and/or its respective directors, officers, employees, agents or contractors, and indemnify and hold harmless IBC and its respective directors, officers, employees, agents and contractors, from and against any and all Claims or damages that may arise, by reason of any breach of this Agreement by Vendor, its personnel or contractors or from Vendor\u2019s use of the Confidential Information including any deficiency in or other issue relating to the use or distribution of that portion of the PMS System that is developed using the Confidential Information. For any Claims that IBC chooses to defend, the Vendor shall, to the extent requested by IBC, participate in and co-operate with and assist IBC in such defence and any related settlement negotiations.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information, and all associated intellectual property rights therein, are and shall remain the exclusive property of IBC and its licensors. By disclosing Confidential Information to Vendor, IBC does not grant any express or implied right to Vendor to or under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information except as otherwise provided herein.\n(b) All Confidential Information is provided by IBC (i) on a non-exclusive basis and (ii) on an \u201cas is\u201d basis without any representation or warranty of any kind. Any use shall be solely at the risk of Vendor. Any software code included in the Confidential Information is for illustrative purposes only. IBC makes no warranties or representations with respect to the Confidential Information, including any warranties or representations that any Confidential Information will be accurate, complete or up-to-date, or free of errors or omissions or that any Confidential Information will be fit for any purpose. Vendor is solely responsible for ensuring that the Confidential Information is suitable for the Vendor\u2019s needs. WITH RESPECT TO THE HCAI SYSTEM, THE SERVICES, OR ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, IBC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS, IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n(c) IBC has or expects to enter into service agreements directly with Providers that will govern such Provider\u2019s access to and use of the HCAI System. However, IBC does not guarantee availability or operation of the HCAI System to Vendor. Without prejudice to any right an individual Provider may have against IBC, IBC shall have no liability to Vendor in respect of any failure or problem in the operation of the HCAI System, including any communication problems between Providers and the HCAI System. IN NO EVENT WILL THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES PAYABLE BY EITHER PARTY INCLUDE, NOR WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR, ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, SAVINGS, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR GOODWILL) ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR THE OPERATION OF THE HCAI SYSTEM, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OR FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY REMEDY CONTAINED HEREIN), NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF SUCH DAMAGES EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. IBC\u2019S LIABILITY FOR ANY MATTER RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR THE OPERATION OF THE HCAI SYSTEM, WHETHER BASED UPON AN ACTION OR CLAIM IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, EQUITY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE AND IN RESPECT OF ALL ACTIONS, CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.\n(d) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of IBC, the Vendor, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of IBC and the Vendor. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion. No employee, agent or representative of IBC is authorized to make any additional representation, warranty or covenant on behalf of IBC.\n(e) If either party employs lawyers to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable lawyers\u2019 fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws in force in the Province of Ontario, and the parties further consent to non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal or provincial courts sitting in Toronto, Ontario. Vendor waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.\n(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party\u2019s respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that Vendor may not assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of IBC. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be void. HCAI may assign this Agreement to any entity which acquires responsibility for the operation of the HCAI System.\n(g) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n(h) IBC may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Vendor. IBC will not exercise such discretion to terminate the Agreement with a specific vendor except for commercially reasonable grounds. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as is practical, remove any functionality incorporated in the PMS System that is based on the Confidential Information.\n(i) The parties confirm that each has read this Agreement in its entirety, that the Agreement is being entered into without undue influence or fraud or coercion or misrepresentation whatsoever, that each has had independent legal advice, that each understands its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, and that this Agreement is being executed voluntarily.\n(j) It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and all related documents be drawn up in English.

Confidential Information disclosed to the Receiving Party by any Disclosing Party subsidiary and/or agents is also covered by this Agreement.\n(b) Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) is or subsequently becomes publicly available without Receiving Party's breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (ii) became known to the Receiving Party prior to Disclosing Party's disclosure of such information to Receiving Party; (iii) became known to Receiving Party from a source other than Disclosing Party other than by breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Disclosing Party; or (iv) is independently developed or acquired legitimately by Receiving Party.\n(c) \""Confidential Materials\"" shall mean all tangible materials containing Confidential Information, including without limitation written or printed documents and computer disks or tapes, whether machine or user readable.\n(d) \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d is the party disclosing the Confidential Information and/or the Confidential Materials.\n(e) \u201cReceiving Party\u201d is the party in receipt of the Confidential Information and/or the Confidential Materials.\n2. Restrictions\n(a) Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third parties for three (3) years following the date of its disclosure by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party, except to Receiving Party's consultants as set out below. However, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with judicial or other governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing Party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure.\n(b) Receiving Party shall take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own Confidential Information, to keep confidential the Confidential Information. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information or Confidential Materials only to Receiving Party's employees or bona-fidae consultants on a need-to-know basis. Receiving\nParty will have executed or shall execute appropriate written agreements with its employees and consultants sufficient to enable them to comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.\n(c) Confidential Information and Confidential Materials may be disclosed, reproduced, summarised, or distributed only in pursuance of the Receiving Party's business relationship with Disclosing Party, and only as otherwise provided hereunder. Receiving Party agrees to segregate all such Confidential Materials from the confidential materials of others in order to prevent the danger of accidental disclosure.\n(d) Receiving Party may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any software disclosed to Receiving Party.\n3. Rights & Remedies\n(a) Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorised use or disclosure of Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party, and will co-operate with Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and/or Confidential Materials and prevent its further unauthorised use.\n(b) Receiving Party shall return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information and/or Confidential Materials, or at Disclosing Party's option, certify destruction of the same in writing to Disclosing Party.\n(c) Receiving Party acknowledges that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorised disclosure of Confidential Information and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such compensation as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n(d) Disclosing Party may visit Receiving Party's premises, with reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to review Receiving Party's compliance with the Terms of this Agreement.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information and Confidential Materials are and shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. By disclosing information to the Receiving Party, Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right to Receiving Party to or under Disclosing Party patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information.\n(b) The terms of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other party's Confidential Information. Further, either party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or from work with such Confidential Information, provided that either party shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as provided herein. The terms \""residuals\"" means information in non-tangible form, which may be retained by persons who have access to the Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. However, the foregoing shall not be deemed to grant to either party a license under the other party's copyrights or patents.\n(c) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of the Disclosing Party, its agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorised officer of Disclosing Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.\n(d) If either party employs lawyers to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable lawyers fees. This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of England and Wales.\n(e) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns.\n(f) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n(g) All obligations created by this Agreement shall survive change or termination of the parties' business relationship.\nEXECUTED BY :\nFor and on behalf of

Confidential Information.\na. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all confidential, proprietary and trade secret information and materials, whether in written, oral, visually, electronic or another format (including, for example, demonstrations, models or proto-types, software, computer tapes, audio or video tapes or recordings, other media), and whether intentionally disclosed or observed inadvertently, includ-ing, but not limited to, the following: [insert specific description if possible]; research, product plans or other information regarding the Discloser\u2019s prod-ucts or services and markets therefor, customer lists and customers, software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances or other business information; information of a confidential, sensitive, non-public, or personal nature, including information belonging to a third party or for which the Company owes a duty of confidentiality; any other Company proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to any materials or any oral and written communications between the parties marked \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201cproprietary\u201d or similarly marked; or any materials which a reasonable person would recognize from the surrounding facts and circumstances to be proprietary or confidential.\nb. The Confidential Information that must be protected under this Agreement in-cludes (i) tangible information (such as written materials, models, and/or speci-mens) identified as being Confidential Information by an appropriate, conspicuous legend (such as \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d); (ii) information in oral or visual form that is identified as being Confidential Information at the time of disclosure and confirmed in writing as Confidential Information within fourteen (14) days after the disclosure; or (iii) information that, given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure, reasonably should be considered to be Confidential Information\n3. Limitations. Confidential Information shall not include information that:\na. is or becomes known publicly through no fault of the Recipient; or\nb. is learned by the Recipient from a third party not under an obligation of confi-dence to the Discloser and who has legitimate and legal possession of the informa-tion; or\nc. is already known to the Recipient before receipt from the Discloser as can be proven by written records; or\nd. is independently developed by employees or consultants of the Recipient who did not have access to any Confidential Information received;\ne. is free of confidentiality restrictions by written agreement of the Discloser.\n4. Nondisclosure. Except as described elsewhere in this Agreement, the Recipient and those of its employees, officers, agents and affiliates permitted access hereunder will hold the Confidential Information in confidence and will take all necessary steps to pre-serve the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient (1) will not disclose any Confidential Information to persons within its organization who do not have a need to know in order for the Recipient to engage in the Purpose; (2) will not disclose any Confidential Information to any person outside of its organization unless such person has a need to know in order for the Recipient to engage in the Purpose, and such person is bound by fiduci-ary or contractual duties of confidentiality to the Recipient that are at least as stringent as those contained in this Agreement; (3) will, if reasonably required, cause each of the Recipient\u2019s employees, officers, agents, affiliates and attorneys who have access to the Confidential Information to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, for the benefit of the Discloser, containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in this Agreement, and, in any event, advise all of its employees, officers, agents, and affiliates of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information; and (4) in all instances, exercise at least the same degree of care to maintain the secrecy of the Con-fidential Information as the Recipient exercises to protect its own most valuable trade secrets, but in no case less than reasonable care.\n5. Exception. If the Recipient is required by order of any court or other government or regulatory agency to disclose any Confidential Information belonging to any Dis-closer, it shall provide all Parties with prompt written notice within 3 business days of any such requirement so that the Parties whose Confidential Information is at risk may seek a protective order or take other appropriate action. Upon the request and at the expense of the requesting Party, the other Parties will reasonably cooperate with the requesting Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. Subject to the foregoing requirements, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for a Recipi-ent to disclose Confidential Information if such disclosure is: (a) in response to a valid order of a court or governmental body of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; (b) otherwise required by law; or (c) necessary to establish the Discloser\u2019s\nrights under this Agreement.\n6.

No Transfer. All Confidential Information disclosed by any Party shall remain the property of the Discloser. This Agreement does not confer any license, right, interest, or title in or to Confidential Information other than as expressly set forth in this Agree-ment. Further, the Parties agree that the Recipient shall use any and all Confidential Information received from the Discloser solely for the Purpose and no other use may be made without the Discloser\u2019s prior written consent, which shall be granted or with-held in its sole discretion.\n8. Protection. Each Party agrees to protect Confidential Information provided to it by the Discloser with at least the same degree of care as it protects its own confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information and shall promptly advise the Discloser, in writing, of any misappropriation or misuse, of which it becomes aware, of Confidential Information by any person.\n9. Personnel. Each Party may use the same personnel who receive Confidential Infor-mation under this Agreement on other projects similar to the Purpose so long as such Party does not breach the confidentiality of this Agreement.\n10. Return of Information. Upon the written request of the Discloser, the Recipient shall either destroy or return to the Discloser any and all Confidential Information in the Recipient\u2019s possession, except for one copy, which copy may be retained for archival purposes in a secure file. All copies of Confidential Information forwarded in error by any Discloser shall be destroyed in their entirety without the Recipient retaining an archival copy.\n11. Warranty. Each Party warrants that it has the right to disclose all of the Confidential Information it discloses, but does not otherwise make any representation as to the ac-curacy, suitability, or completeness of such Confidential Information. The Discloser will not be liable to the Recipient for any damage resulting from any use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient. All Confidential Information of the Discloser shall remain the exclusive and sole property of such Party.

No Assignment. Neither Party shall transfer or assign any rights or delegate any ob-ligations herein, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the above, either Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement and the obligations hereunder to any successor-in-interest by way of a merger, acquisi-tion, or sale of all or substantially all of that Party\u2019s assets on condition that the assign-ee of this Agreement will assume all obligations and liability of the assignor under or in connection with this Agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n13. Savings. If any provision or covenant of the Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions or covenants of this Agreement shall be unaffected.\n14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to this subject matter, is valid if signed within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, and supersedes all prior understandings whether written or oral. Further modifications may be made if in writing and signed by authorized repre-sentatives of both Parties.\n15. Injunctive Relief. Each Party agrees that the wrongful disclosure of Confidential In-formation may cause irreparable injury that is inadequately compensable by monetary damages. As such, either Party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for the breach and/or the threatened breach of this Agreement in addition to any other remedies it may seek at law or equity, and the Recipient will not raise the defense of an adequate remedy at law.\n16. Indemnification. Each Party shall fully indemnify the other against any and all ac-tions, claims, liability, costs, damages, charges and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with or arising out of any breach by a Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement, or by any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information by a third party or by any employee of any Party to whom Confidential Information has been disclosed or who has been allowed access thereto. Each Party acknowledges and confirms that a breach of its obligations hereunder cannot be compensated adequately solely by an award of damages or indemnity or other pecuniary remedy, and that the non-breaching Party shall also be entitled in the event of any such breach to the rem-edies of injunction, specific performance, and/or other equitable relief in respect of any such breach. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by either Party of any of its rights including rights to damages or indemnity or other pecuniary remedy.\n17. Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In any action to enforce, arising under, and/or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party as determined by the court or other body with jurisdic-tion by agreement of the Parties, shall be entitled to recover from the other Party, in addition to all other awards and remedies to which it is entitled, its reasonable attor-neys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with such action.\n18. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [state] without regard to any conflict of law principles.\n19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties as to the Confidential Information being disclosed and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether oral or written, be-tween the parties. If any Confidential Information is made available by accessing either Party\u2019s Web site, this Agreement shall govern such Confidential Information without regard to any terms of use, \u201cclick wrap\u201d agreement, or any similar agreement contained thereon.\nNOW, THEREFORE, intending to be bound hereby, the Parties have executed or have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly

PROVIDER, through its employee, the PROVIDER Contact, shall disclose CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to RECIPIENT, through its employee, the RECIPIENT Contact, to enable RECIPIENT to fully evaluate such disclosure solely for the PURPOSE. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall be indicated as confidential at the time of disclosure.\n2. RECIPIENT agrees to accept the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and to employ all reasonable efforts to maintain the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION as secret and confidential, such efforts to be no less than the degree of care employed by RECIPIENT to preserve and safeguard RECIPIENT's own confidential information. The CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not be disclosed or revealed to anyone except employees of RECIPIENT who have a need to know the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for the PURPOSE and who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n3. It is hereby acknowledged by PROVIDER that RECIPIENT shall incur no liability merely for examining and considering the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. However, RECIPIENT agrees that it will not use the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for any purpose other than the PURPOSE without the prior written consent of PROVIDER.\n4. RECIPIENT\u2018s obligations under Paragraphs 2 and 3 above shall not extend to any part of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:\n(a) that can be demonstrated to have been in the public domain or publicly known and readily available to the trade or the public prior to the date of the disclosure; or\n(b) that can be demonstrated, from written records, to have been in RECIPIENT's possession or readily available to RECIPIENT from another source not under obligation of secrecy to PROVIDER prior to the disclosure; or\n(c) that becomes part of the public domain or publicly known by publication or otherwise, not due to any unauthorized act by RECIPIENT; or\n(d) that is subsequently disclosed to RECIPIENT by a third party who is not under an obligation of confidentiality to PROVIDER; or\n(e) that is required by any law, regulation, or order of court to be disclosed by RECIPIENT. Prior to disclosing proprietary or CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of the PROVIDER, the RECIPIENT shall first notify and provide it an opportunity to prevent disclosure.\n5. RECIPIENT's obligations under Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall extend for a period of five (5) years from the effective date of this Agreement.\n6. It is understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute, by implication or otherwise, the grant to RECIPIENT of any license or other rights under any patent, patent application, or other intellectual property right or interest belonging to PROVIDER, or as permitting RECIPIENT to unfairly obtain the right to use any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which becomes publicly known through an improper act or omission on its part.\n 7. Neither party shall use the name of the other or any contraction or derivative thereof or the name(s) of the other party's faculty members, employees, or students, as applicable, in any advertising, promotional, sales literature, or fundraising documents without prior written consent from the other party.\n 8.

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT dated the ___ day of _________________.\nBETWEEN:\n_________________________________ _________________________________ _________________________________ _________________________________\nOF THE FIRST PART\nAND:\nKERBER APPLIED RESEARCH INC. 53 Isaac Brock Drive, Stoney Creek, Ontario Canada L8J 2P1\nOF THE SECOND PART WHEREAS:\nA. The parties contemplate entering into business and technical discussions concerning both current and planned products; and\nB. It may be necessary or desirable for each party to disclose to the other party certain confidential or proprietary technical information in order to enable discussions to freely take place between them concerning the subject matter mentioned above.\nNOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises, covenants and agreements herein set forth, the parties agree as follows:\n1. For the purpose of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means information, technical or commercial, whether in visual or machine readable form, received by one party from the other which is marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d, or which would logically be considered confidential or proprietary in view of its relationship to the whole disclosure. Information initially furnished orally and identified by the disclosing party as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure will be confirmed by the disclosing party as Confidential Information in writing within thirty (30) days.\n2. The receiving party will not use, manufacture or sell any document, schematic, drawing, photograph, specification, specimen or any other material making up any part of the Confidential Information, or use any Confidential Information as a basis for the design or creation of any items or other means without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.\n3. For a period of five (5) years from the date of receiving it, all Confidential Information will be maintained in confidence by the receiving party, will not be disclosed to any third party or to any persons employed in its business other than those having a need to know for the purposes set forth above, and will be protected with the same degree of care as the receiving party normally uses in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no case with any less degree than reasonable care. Each party further agrees not to use any Confidential Information received from the other party except for the purposes set forth above.\n4. The restrictions above will not apply to Confidential Information which:\n(a) Is known by the receiving party at the time of receipt;\n(b) Is or becomes a part of the public domain without a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party;\n(c) The receiving party obtains from a third party under conditions permitting its disclosure to others;\n(d) Is independently developed by the receiving party; or\n(e) Is disclosed pursuant to judicial action or government regulations, provided that the receiving party notifies the furnishing party prior to such disclosure and co-operates with the furnishing party in the event the furnishing party elects to legally contest and avoid such disclosure.\n5. The furnishing of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement shall not be construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or implicitly, any rights, licences or relationships.\n6. Each party shall retain all rights of ownership over all intellectual property associated with the above referenced subject matter, including the rights of ownership of patents, trademarks and copyrights.\nAll tangible information including, without limitation, documents, schematics, drawings, photographs, specifications, specimens or any other information submitted by either party to the other, will remain the property of the furnishing party. If either party elects not to pursue any further business undertaking, each party will promptly return upon request all tangible information including any and all copies thereof relating to all Confidential Information.\nNeither party shall not, and it shall ensure that any of its affiliates do not, for a period of five years from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, induce any employee employed by the other party to leave such employ or offer to employ or employ such employee.\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario.\nFailure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any term hereof.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.\nCompany: _____________________________________\nPer: _________________________________________\nName:\nTitle:\nand\nPer: ____________________________________\nTom Kerber\n"",","confidentiality, nondisclosure, agreementnthis, agreement, dated, day, nbetweenn, nof, first, partnandnkerber, applied, research, inc, 53, isaac, brock, drive, stoney, creek, ontario, canada, l8j, 2p1nof, second, part, whereasna, party, contemplate, entering, business, technical, discussion, concerning, current, planned, product, andnb, may, necessary, desirable, party, disclose, party, certain, confidential, proprietary, technical, information, order, enable, discussion, freely, take, place, concerning, subject, matter, mentioned, abovennow, therefore, consideration, premise, covenant, agreement, herein, set, forth, party, agree, followsn1, purpose, agreement, u201cconfidential, informationu201d, mean, information, technical, commercial, whether, visual, machine, readable, form, received, one, party, marked, u201cconfidentialu201d, u201cproprietaryu201d, would, logically, considered, confidential, proprietary, view, relationship, whole, disclosure, information, initially, furnished, orally, identified, disclosing, party, confidential, proprietary, time, disclosure, confirmed, disclosing, party, confidential, information, writing, within, thirty, 30, daysn2, receiving, party, use, manufacture, sell, document, schematic, drawing, photograph, specification, specimen, material, making, part, confidential, information, use, confidential, information, basis, design, creation, item, mean, without, prior, written, consent, disclosing, partyn3, period, five, 5, year, date, receiving, confidential, information, maintained, confidence, receiving, party, disclosed, third, party, person, employed, business, need, know, purpose, set, forth, protected, degree, care, receiving, party, normally, us, protection, confidential, proprietary, information, case, le, degree, reasonable, care, party, agrees, use, confidential, information, received, party, except, purpose, set, forth, aboven4, restriction, apply, confidential, information, whichna, known, receiving, party, time, receiptnb, becomes, part, public, domain, without, breach, agreement, receiving, partync, receiving, party, obtains, third, party, condition, permitting, disclosure, othersnd, independently, developed, receiving, party, orne, disclosed, pursuant, judicial, action, government, regulation, provided, receiving, party, notifies, furnishing, party, prior, disclosure, cooperates, furnishing, party, event, furnishing, party, elect, legally, contest, avoid, disclosuren5, furnishing, confidential, information, pursuant, agreement, shall, construed, granting, conferring, either, expressly, implicitly, right, licence, relationshipsn6, party, shall, retain, right, ownership, intellectual, property, associated, referenced, subject, matter, including, right, ownership, patent, trademark, copyrightsnall, tangible, information, including, without, limitation, document, schematic, drawing, photograph, specification, specimen, information, submitted, either, party, remain, property, furnishing, party, either, party, elect, pursue, business, undertaking, party, promptly, return, upon, request, tangible, information, including, copy, thereof, relating, confidential, informationnneither, party, shall, shall, ensure, affiliate, period, five, year, date, agreement, without, prior, written, consent, party, induce, employee, employed, party, leave, employ, offer, employ, employ, employeenthis, agreement, shall, governed, interpreted, accordance, law, province, ontarionfailure, enforce, provision, agreement, shall, constitute, waiver, term, hereofnin, witness, whereof, party, executed, agreement, day, year, first, writtenncompany, nper, nnamentitlenandnper, ntom, kerbern"

"      MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made and entered into, as of May 8th, 2018 (\u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between FullStory, Inc., having a principal place of business at 120 Ottley Dr NE, Ste 100, Atlanta, GA 30324 and ____________, having a principal place of business at ________________.\n1. \""Confidential Information\""means information that relates to the Purpose (as defined below) or that, although not related to such Purpose, is nevertheless disclosed as a result of the parties' discussions in that regard, and that should reasonably have been understood by the party receiving such information (the \u201cRecipient\u201d), because of legends or other markings, the circumstances of disclosure or the nature of the information itself, to be proprietary and confidential to the party disclosing the information (the \u201cDiscloser\u201d) or an Affiliate of the Discloser or to a third party. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form (including on electronic media) or by oral, visual or other means. Confidential Information includes all of the following, whether or not reduced to tangible form: software codes and computer programs; trade secrets, patents, patent applications, and copyrights; know-how, processes, research, development, ideas, and inventions (whether patentable or not); formulas and algorithms; technical drawings, schematics, design, diagrams, models, and flow charts; documentation and specifications; databases and materials; financial information and projections; business plans and needs; employee information; customer lists, sales information and forecasts, marketing plans, customer leads, customer information and anticipated markets; and other information of a similar nature, and any other trade secrets or non-public business information belonging or pertaining to either of the parties. \""Affiliate\""means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a party.\n2. Recipient will not use any Confidential Information except to the extent necessary for the internal purpose of discussing, analyzing, and exchanging information about each party\u2019s products, services and other offerings to determine whether the parties may enter into a mutually beneficial business relationship (\u201cPurpose\u201d). Recipient will not disseminate or disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm, business or governmental agency or department, except as such disclosure is expressly permitted in this Agreement. Recipient will treat all of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as Recipient treats its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable care. Recipient will disclose Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information only to those of Recipient\u2019s employees, consultants, and contractors who have a \u201cneed to know\u201d the information to assist Recipient with respect to the Purpose and who are legally bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those terms and conditions applicable to Recipient under this Agreement. Neither party is obligated under this Agreement to purchase from or provide to the other party any service or product. Recipient agrees not to copy or reverse engineer, or attempt to derive the composition or underlying information, structure or ideas of any Confidential Information. No licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement; Recipient does not acquire any right in or to the Confidential Information except the limited right to use it for the Purpose.\n3. Recipient\u2019s obligations under Section 2 will not apply to any of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information that Recipient can document: (a) was in the public domain at or subsequent to the time the Confidential Information was communicated to Recipient by Discloser through no fault of Recipient; (b) was rightfully in Recipient\u2019s possession free of any obligation of confidence at or subsequent to the time the Confidential Information was communicated to Recipient by the Discloser; (c) was developed by employees or agents of Recipient independently of and without reference to any of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information; or (d) was communicated by Discloser to an unaffiliated third party free of any obligation of confidence. A disclosure by Recipient of any of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information (a) in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body; (b) as otherwise required by law; or (c) necessary to establish the rights of either party under this Agreement will not be considered to be a breach of this Agreement by the Recipient; provided, however, that Recipient provides prompt prior written notice to the Discloser to enable Discloser to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent the disclosure.\n4. Neither party will communicate any information to the other in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS,\u201d AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, MERCHANTABILITY, AND NONINFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED. Discloser will have no liability or responsibility for reasonably unknown errors or omissions in, or any decisions made by Recipient in reliance on, any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.\n5. Recipient will obtain any licenses or approvals the U.S. government or any of its agencies require prior to exporting, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from Discloser pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing that data.\n6. This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and will continue until the date one party receives written notice of termination of this Agreement from the other party; provided, however, that a Recipient\u2019s obligations under Section 2 will survive termination of this Agreement and will continue with respect to the Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information until the obligations no longer apply pursuant to Section 3 above.\n7. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement will be and will remain the property of the Discloser; all such information in tangible form will be returned to Discloser promptly upon written request or upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and will not thereafter be retained in any form by Recipient or its Affiliates or any of their employees. Except upon mutual written agreement or as may be required by law, neither party will disclose to others the existence or terms of this Agreement, the discussions that gave rise to this Agreement or the fact that there have been, or will be, discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement.\n8. The parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information is unique and valuable and a breach by Recipient of this Agreement will cause irreparable and continuing damage to Discloser for which money damages are insufficient. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the obligations under this Agreement, Discloser will be entitled to: (1) seek specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond, and (ii) indemnification from any loss or harm, including recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, in connection with any breach or enforcement of Recipient\u2019s obligations hereunder or the unauthorized use or release of such Confidential Information. Any such relief will be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages. Recipient must notify Discloser in writing immediately upon the occurrence of any such unauthorized release or other breach of which it is aware and will assist Discloser in remedying the unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information.\n9. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement will be in writing and will be delivered as follows, with notice deemed given as indicated: (a) by personal delivery, when delivered personally; (b) by overnight courier, upon written verification of receipt; or (c) by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, upon verification of receipt. Notice will be sent to the addresses set forth above or to such other address as either party may provide in writing.\n10. This Agreement (a) is the complete agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior agreements whether oral or written with respect to disclosures concerning such subject matter; (b) may not be amended or modified except by in a writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties; and (c) will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware without regard to conflict of laws provisions. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New Castle County, Delaware as applicable, for any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement, except that in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of the federal or state courts located in New Castle County, Delaware such personal jurisdiction will be non-exclusive. Additionally, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, a claim for equitable relief arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except to an Affiliate, without the prior written consent of the other party. No failure or delay in exercising or any partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder will be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision will be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties as expressed herein.\nThe parties agree and are signing this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\nFULLSTORY, INC. _________________\nBy: By:\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title:\n"",","mutual, nondisclosure, agreementnthis, mutual, nondisclosure, agreement, u201cagreementu201d, made, entered, may,

Where the Proprietary Information has not been or cannot be reduced to written form at the time of disclosure and such disclosure is made orally or visually, complete written summaries of all proprietary aspects of any such oral or visual disclosures shall have been delivered to the receiving Party within 20 calendar days of said oral or visual disclosures; provided, however, that Proprietary Information that is not marked or reduced to writing is protected under this Non-Disclosure Agreement if the context and manner in which such Proprietary Information is disclosed would indicate to a reasonable person familiar with the pharmaceutical industry that such Proprietary Information can be reasonably expected to be treated as confidential. Neither Party shall identify information as proprietary which is not in good faith believed to be confidential, privileged, a trade secret, or otherwise entitled to such markings or proprietary claims.\n3) Each Party covenants and agrees that it will, during the term of this Non-Disclosure Agreement, keep in confidence, and prevent the disclosure of Proprietary Information to any third party other than those of receiving Party\u2019s (i) employees, agents, representatives, directors or officers (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who need to know such Proprietary Information for the Purpose.

If disclosing Party fails to obtain a protective order, receiving Party may disclose only those pieces of Proprietary Information that it is legally required to disclose.\nAny Proprietary Information provided by one Party to the other shall be used only in furtherance of the Purpose. Proprietary Information shall be, upon request at any time, destroyed or returned to the disclosing Party, provided that receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such Proprietary Information for purposes of monitoring compliance with its obligations under this Non-Disclosure Agreement. If either Party loses or makes unauthorized disclosure of the other Party\u2019s Proprietary Information, it shall notify such other Party immediately and take all steps reasonable and necessary to retrieve the lost or improperly disclosed Proprietary Information.\n4) The standard of care for protecting Proprietary Information imposed on the Party receiving such information, will be that degree of care the receiving Party uses to prevent disclosure, publication or dissemination of its own proprietary information, but not less than a reasonable standard of care.\n5) In addition to all other rights and remedies, disclosing Party has the right to seek an injunction to prevent receiving Party\u2019s actual or threatened breach of this Non-Disclosure Agreement, without having to prove actual damages or post a bond.\n6) In providing any information hereunder, each disclosing Party makes no representations, either express or implied, as to the information\u2019s adequacy, sufficiency, or freedom from defect of any kind, including freedom from any patent infringement that may result from the use of such information.\n7) Notwithstanding the termination or expiration of any other agreement executed in conjunction with this Agreement, the obligations of the Parties with respect to Proprietary Information shall continue to be governed by this Non-Disclosure Agreement.\n8) This Non-Disclosure Agreement contains the entire agreement relative to the protection of information to be exchanged hereunder, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written understandings and agreements regarding this issue. A Party\u2019s failure to exercise a right under this Non-Disclosure Agreement or failure to insist upon compliance with any term of this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall not be a waiver of that right or term. If any provision of this Non-Disclosure Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from this Non-Disclosure Agreement and the other provisions shall remain in force. This Non-Disclosure Agreement shall not be modified or amended, except in a written instrument executed by the Parties.\n9) Nothing contained in this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall, by express grant, implication, estoppel or otherwise, create in either Party any right, title, interest, or license in or to the Proprietary Information, inventions, patents, technical data, computer software, or software documentation of the other Party.\n10) Nothing contained in this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall grant to either Party the right to make commitments of any kind for or on behalf of any other Party without the prior written consent of that other Party.\n11) This Non-Disclosure Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n12) Receiving Party\u2019s confidentiality and non-use obligations under this Non-Disclosure Agreement will be in effect for a period of five (5) years, starting on the effective date. The effective date of this Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be the date stipulated at the beginning of this Non-Disclosure Agreement.\n13) This Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

"      MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement is between ADP, LLC, (\u201cADP\u201d), and Partner (the \u201cPartner\u201d) and is effective when accepted online by Partner (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d). This Agreement is made to set forth the basis under which ADP and Partner will furnish and/or disclose to each other certain financial, business, technical and other information in connection with Partner\u2019s submission of its Application for evaluation by ADP for the potential sale of, promotion of, access to and/or marketing of, such Application in the ADP Marketplace to current or prospective customers or clients of ADP (the \u201cProspects\u201d) through the ADP Marketplace (the \u201cEvaluation\u201d).\nFor good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, ADP and the Partner agree as follows:\nSection 1. Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms will have the meanings specified below:\n\u201cAffiliate\u201d means, with respect to party, any individual, Partner, corporation, partnership or other entity, directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such party.\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all financial, business and other information, in whatever form or medium (whether written, oral or electronic), including, without limitation, any trade secrets, processes, financial data, technical data and documentation, strategic planning, product/service specifications, prototypes, computer programs, drawings, models, customer information and marketing data that is furnished or disclosed by a Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party solely in connection with the Evaluation, except that such term will not include (i) information already known by the Receiving Party without an obligation of confidentiality, (ii) information that is or becomes publicly known other than through a breach by the Receiving Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement, (iii) information received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not known by the Receiving Party to be under an obligation of confidence to the Disclosing Party, (iv) information independently developed by the Receiving Party without reliance upon the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party and (v) information that the Disclosing Party has disclosed to other parties without similar obligations of confidentiality.\n\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d means the party hereto (or Affiliate of the party hereto) that furnishes Confidential Information to the other party, or Affiliate of the other party, hereto.\n\u201cReceiving Party\u201d means the party hereto (or Affiliate of the party hereto) that receives Confidential Information from the other party, or Affiliate of the other party, hereto.\n\u201cRepresentative\u201d means the directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, rating agencies, consultants, counsel, and other representatives of ADP or the Partner, as applicable.\nSection 2. Use and Ownership of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information shall be used solely for the purpose of Partner\u2019s submission of its Application for evaluation by ADP for the potential sale of, promotion of, access to and/or marketing of, such Application in the ADP Marketplace to Prospects through the ADP Marketplace, and for no other purpose. The Receiving Party agrees that the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party is and will remain the property and asset of the Disclosing Party.\nSection 3. Confidentiality Obligation. Except as required by law, the Receiving Party shall treat as confidential and will not use (other than for the purpose of evaluating the Partner Application as stated in Section 2 above), disclose or otherwise make available any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person other than Representatives of the Receiving Party who have a business need to know for purposes of the Evaluation, and who have been advised by the Receiving Party of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Receiving Party will instruct its Representatives who have access to the Confidential Information to keep the same confidential by using the same care and discretion that the Receiving Party uses with respect to its own confidential property and trade secrets, which will be no less than reasonable care and discretion. The Receiving Party will be responsible for the compliance of its Representatives with the terms of this Agreement. If a Receiving Party is required by applicable law, regulation, court order or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement and the Receiving Party will request that all Confidential Information so disclosed is treated confidentially (and any such disclosure by the Receiving Party will not violate the terms of this Agreement). The Disclosing Party shall reimburse the Receiving Party for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with its compliance with the terms of the immediately preceding sentence.\nSection 4. Compliance by Affiliates. Each of ADP and the Partner will be responsible for compliance by its respective Affiliates with the terms of this Agreement.\nSection 5. Limitation on Obligation; No warranties, etc. Except for the obligation of confidentiality and the restrictions on use imposed by this Agreement upon the Receiving Party, each party acknowledges that no obligation of any kind is assumed or implied against the other party by virtue of any meeting or any discussion regarding the Evaluation with respect to whatever information is exchanged. Further, this Agreement and any meetings or communications of the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will not (i) constitute any offer, request, or contract among the parties to engage in any transaction, nor (ii) constitute any offer, request or contract involving a buyer-seller relationship, venture, teaming or partnership relationship among the parties. Each party hereto hereby acknowledges that the Disclosing Party makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information disclosed by it.\nSection 6. Reproduction and Return of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will not reproduce the Confidential Information except as reasonably necessary for purposes of the Evaluation. If the Receiving Party reproduces all or any part of any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will not remove or obscure any confidential or proprietary notices or legends, if any, that appear in the originals thereof. At the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will either return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all Confidential Information and any reproductions thereof. The authorized officer of the Receiving Party that is responsible for such return or destruction shall deliver a written certification to the Disclosing Party of such return or destruction. The Receiving Party\u2019s obligations under Sections 2 and 3 will survive any return or destruction of Confidential Information.\nSection 7. Notice of Unauthorized Use. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, and will reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.\nSection 8. Competition; Independent Product Development Not Affected. The parties hereto acknowledge that they may compete in certain lines of business. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the parties from continuing to so compete or from continuing to carry out their respective plans and objectives, provided that the parties comply with the terms of this Agreement. Further, the terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or acquire products, functionality or services of the same type as may be included within any Confidential Information or to enter into any business transaction with any other company which owns or has rights to any such similar products or services, as long as such right is exercised without the use of any other party's Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.\nIn addition, each party agrees that any demonstration, description, or disclosure of its products, services, or methods to the other party, including but not limited to any functionality of its products, services, or methods (\u201cProduct Information\u201d), is not, and will not be considered, Confidential Information hereunder (other than with respect to the non-disclosure obligations contained herein). Each party further agrees that any demonstration, description, or disclosure of Product Information to the other party will not form the basis for any action by the Company against ADP, or ADP against the Company, for breach of this Agreement ((other than with respect to the non-disclosure obligations contained herein), breach of contract, or misappropriation of trade secrets.\nSection 9. No Implied License. Except as otherwise provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an implied license in favor of either party to any proprietary rights of the other party, including, without limitation, any patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secret information. Each party agrees not to use any trade name, service mark, or trademark of the other party or refer to the other party in any promotional activity or material without first obtaining the prior written consent of such party.\nSection 10. Attorney-Client Privilege. To the extent that any Confidential Information may include materials subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, each party agrees that both such parties have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is each party\u2019s desire, intention and mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine and other applicable privilege. All Confidential Information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine and other applicable privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement and under the joint defense doctrine.\nSection 11. Notices. All notices, requests, consents, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement will be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient if delivered in person or by express courier to the party to be notified. Any notice to ADP or the Partner will be delivered to the address specified under the respective signature lines below, or to such other address as the parties will advise the other in writing from time to time.\nSection 12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement may not be changed, modified or amended except by a writing signed by each party to this Agreement. This Agreement may not be discharged except by performance in accordance with its terms. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nconcluded between\nM&R Automation GmbH\nTeslastra\u00dfe 8\nA-8074 Grambach near Graz\n- hereinafter referred to as \""M&R\"" -\nand\nxxxx GmbH\nStreet xx, POSTAL CODE, CITY\n- hereinafter referred to as \""Partner\"" -\nPreamble\nM&R will communicate, disclose or make accessible confidential information to the partner in the scope of a draft, an offer phase and/or project handling (hereinafter briefly referred to as \""Project\""), among others.\nAgainst this background, the contracting parties enter into this non-disclosure agreement and agree as follows:\nI. Confidential Information\n\""Confidential information\"" in the sense of this agreement is all the information of a financial, commercial, technical or other confidential nature, in particular all specifications, descriptions, drafts, drawings, constructions, cross-sections, samples, data, files, inventions, formulas, procedures, plans, programs, models and other knowledge, experience and know-how that are not part of the state of the art that are disclosed or made accessible to the Partner by M&R in the scope of the project, and that independently of whether they were expressly or implicitly designated as secret or confidential in each case.\nIn particular, data in connection with accounting, such as balance sheets, interim balance sheets, reports, analyses, supporting documents and the like are confidential information as defined by the agreement.\nII. Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThe Partner shall protect the confidential information disclosed to him in connection with the project or to which he is given access in connection with the project from being disclosed to third parties, being used by third parties or being published at least with the same diligence he applies in order to protect his own confidential information of identical importance.\nThe Partner shall use confidential information from M&R for no other purposes than the project unless M&R has approved of such a different use in writing beforehand.\nIf further third parties are involved in the project, the Partner shall not disclose or make available confidential information to the third party before M&R has approved of that and the third party has also committed himself to strict confidentiality.\nConfidential information may only be passed on to general managers, employees, representatives or consultants of the Partner for whom the disclosure of or access to such confidential information is demonstrably necessary in the scope of the project. Insofar as these parties are not already bound to secrecy because of a work contract and/or based on a statutory non-disclosure obligation, these parties have to be bound to secrecy beforehand by making them sign a declaration according to Annex 1, and that also beyond the termination of their employment; this shall apply independently of the type or the legal arrangement of the employment.\nUnless otherwise provided for in this agreement, the above-mentioned obligations of this Section II shall apply in each case for a period of 3 (three) years after the point in time at which the respective confidential information was disclosed by M&R or made accessible to the Partner.\nIII. Exceptions from the Non-Disclosure Agreement\nExcepted from the non-disclosure obligation above shall be know-how and information\na) which was apparent to or generally known by the Partner or was state of the art already;\nb) which was already known by the Partner at the time of disclosure;\nc) which subsequently becomes apparent or generally known or state of the art through no fault of the Partner;\nd) which is disclosed or made accessible to the Partner by a third party who has the right to do so;\ne) regarding which M&R previously agreed to a passing on, disclosure or making accessible to third parties in writing.\nThe burden of proof for the presence of an exception in the above-mentioned sense lies with the Partner.\nIf the Partner or his respective general managers, employees, representatives or consultants are requested or obliged to disclose confidential information by a court, M&R shall be notified of that so timely as to enable M&R to initiate immediate legal action in court or to use another suitable legal remedy. If this immediate legal action and/or a different legal remedy is not obtained within a reasonable period of time, the Partner that is obliged to disclose shall only disclose the part of the confidential information to the disclosure of which he is obliged by law.\nIV. Subcontractors\nInsofar as the Partner employs subcontractors for the fulfillment of his duties from the scope of the project, the Partner shall be obliged to bind them to secrecy as well in writing in a scope according to this non-disclosure agreement. Proof of this obligation has to be shown to M&R upon request.\nV. No Granting of Rights\nThe communication, disclosure or making accessible of confidential information grants the Partner no rights, licenses or industrial property rights of any kind whatsoever. All rights in the confidential information shall remain with M&R.\nNo relations extending beyond that between the contracting parties, in particular no powers of agency of the one contracting party for the other contracting party, can be derived from this agreement. In particular, this agreement does not oblige the contracting parties to disclose confidential information to the respective other party or to enter into contractual relations with the other contracting party in the future.\nVI. Consequences of a Breach of the Obligation to Confidentiality\nIn the event of a culpable breach, the Partner shall be liable to M&R for compensation for the damage caused and shall keep M&R indemnified from all resulting claims and costs. If it is certain that confidential information found its way to third parties from the sphere of the Partner, a culpable (at least negligent) breach of non-disclosure obligations shall be assumed - except when there is evidence to the contrary.\nThe Partner shall equally be liable for the conduct of his general manager, employees, representatives, consultants, subcontractors, vicarious agents and all other parties that are involved in the project by him.\nVII. Term and Consequences of Termination\nThis agreement shall become effective upon signing and has a term of 5 (five) years. Without prejudice to the provision in Section II, last paragraph, the non-disclosure obligation for business secrets and know-how shall, however, continue to apply after termination of this agreement unless one of the exceptions described in Section III , Subsection c), d) or e) has occurred, for which the burden of proof lies with the Partner.\nUpon termination of this agreement, all the confidential information made available by M&R shall be returned to M&R on request of M&R, all copies that were made shall be destroyed or handed over to M&R and all stored information shall be deleted. Confidential information that has to be kept in order to comply with legal obligations, in particular archiving obligations, shall be excepted from that.\nVIII. No Liability for the Correctness of the Confidential Information\nM&R accepts no liability for the use or the trust in the correctness or completeness of the confidential information disclosed to the Partner.\nIX. Final Provisions\nIn the event that individual or several provisions within this Contract are or become ineffective, the effectiveness of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected thereof. The contracting parties are obliged to replace an invalid provision by one that is in line with the purpose of the invalid provision in an allowable manner or comes as close to it as possible.\nAny amendments or alterations to this agreement may only be made in writing. This shall also apply to the written form clause and a waiver of the written form clause, respectively.\nThis agreement is governed by Austrian law excluding its conflict of law rules.\nThe competent court of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this agreement shall be Graz.\nGrambach, date ...........................

Confidential Information. As used herein, \""Confidential Information\"" shall mean any and all oral and written proprietary information provided by one party (the \""Provider\"") to the other (the \""Recipient\""), including but not limited to financial documents, customer lists, development plans, business plans, trade secrets, and intellectual property. \""Confidential Information\"" does not include information that (i) is generally available to the public on the date of this agreement, (ii) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise permissible hereunder, (iii) was in the Recipient's possession prior to disclosure by the Provider, except to the extent that the Recipient received the information in violation of any requirement of confidentiality of which the Recipient was aware or reasonably should have been aware, or (iv) is made available to the Recipient lawfully and in good faith by a third party who Recipient reasonably believes is not under an obligation to keep such information confidential.\n2. Use of Confidential Information. Each party agrees that at all times and notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement it will hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any third party Confidential Information of the other, except as approved in advance in writing by the other party to this Agreement, and will use the Confidential Information for no purpose other than evaluating or pursuing a business relationship with the other party to this Agreement.\n3. Employees, Advisors, and Agents. The Recipient will only share Confidential Information with its employees, advisors, and agents when such disclosure is necessary for the purpose for which the Provider disclosed the information. All employees, advisors, and agents of the Recipient party with access to Confidential Information shall be bound by this Agreement and the Recipient shall be responsible for any unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by its employees, advisors and/or agents.\n4. Court Order. Notwithstanding the above, the Recipient shall not be in violation of this Agreement if the disclosure is in response to a valid subpoena or order by a court or other government body, provided the Recipient presents the Provider with as much prior written notice of such disclosure as is reasonable in order to permit the Provider an opportunity to seek confidential treatment of such information.\n5. Care. The Recipient will use at least as much care in maintaining the confidentiality of any disclosed Information as that party uses in maintaining its own Confidential Information, and the Recipient will use at least reasonable care.\n6. Notification of Loss or Disclosure. Each party shall immediately notify the other upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information of the other party.\n7. Reproduction of Information. Confidential Information shall not be reproduced in any form except as required to accomplish the intent of this Agreement. Any reproduction of any Confidential Information by the Recipient shall remain the property of the Provider and shall contain any and all confidential or proprietary notices or legends that appear on the original, unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Provider.\n8. Return of Information. Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, or upon written request by either party, each party shall promptly return to the other all documents and other tangible materials representing the other's Confidential Information and all copies thereof, or destroy all Confidential Information and copies thereof and certify its destruction to the Provider.\n9. No Property Rights; No Partnership or Joint Venture. The parties recognize and agree that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any property rights, by license or otherwise, to the Confidential Information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, and any grant, if any, shall be set forth in a separate, express written agreement. Unless set forth in a separate, express written agreement, the parties hereto have not formed and are not forming a partnership or joint venture and neither party may claim otherwise.\n10. Term. This Agreement shall commence on the first date that both parties have signed the Agreement (the \""Effective Date\"") and shall terminate 3 years following the Effective Date. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, given that the party provides the other party with at least 90 days prior written notice. Following termination of this agreement, confidentiality shall still be maintained for two years following the termination of this Agreement.\n11. State Law. This Agreement and all disputes rising hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n12. Injunctive Relief. In the event that one party breaches or threatens to breach this agreement the parties agree that monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy, and therefore, the other party will be entitled to an immediate permanent injunction against such breach and such other equitable relief as is necessary to enforce any and all of the provisions of this Agreement.\n13. Interpretation. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect other provisions, but this Agreement will be reformed, construed, and enforced as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein. The language in all parts of this Agreement will be construed, in all cases, according to its fair meaning, and not for or against either party hereto because one party may have drafted the Agreement.\n14. Entire Agreement; No Oral Modification. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement is the complete, final, and exclusive embodiment of their agreement with regard to this subject matter and supersedes any prior oral discussions or written communications and agreements. This Agreement is entered into without reliance on any promise or representation other than those expressly contained herein, and it cannot be modified or amended except in writing signed by both parties.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement effective as of the date first set forth above.\n"",","mutual, nondisclosure, agreementnthis, mutual, nondisclosure,

The parties agree as follows:\n1.0 Project Defined\nEach party has requested or may be receiving from the other party information of a non-public nature for use by each party and its officers, directors, agents, employees, and representatives, including financial and legal advisers and, if either party is a partnership, its partners (collectively, \""Representatives\"") in connection with consideration by the parties of a possible agreement, partnership, joint venture, consortium relationship, or other business relationship between the parties (the \u201cProject\u201d).\n2.0 Confidential Information Defined\nThe parties acknowledge that, in the course of their consideration of and any concurrent or subsequent discussions between CVS and Vendor or their representatives relating to the Project, each party may receive certain non-public and confidential information from or about the other party or its affiliates, including but not limited to technical, financial, and business information and models, names of potential customers or partners, proposed business deals, reports, plans, market projections, software programs, data, or any other confidential and proprietary information relating to the Project. All such technical, financial, or other business information thus supplied by either party to the other or the other's representatives is hereinafter called the \""Information\"". The term \""Information\"" as used herein also includes (i) the fact that the Information has been made available to or is being inspected or evaluated by the receiving party, (ii) the fact that such discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Project or other related transactions between CVS and Vendor, and (iii) any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect to the Project or other related transactions, including the status thereof. Any Information supplied by either party to the other prior to the execution of this Agreement shall be considered in the same manner and be subject to the same treatment as the Information made available after the execution of this Agreement.\n3.0 Exclusions from Definition\nExcept as provided in (i)-(iii) of 2.0 Confidential Information Defined, the term \""Information\"" as used herein does not include any data or information which is already known to the receiving party at the time it is disclosed to the receiving party, or which before being divulged by the receiving party (a) has become generally known to the public through no wrongful act of the receiving party; (b) has been rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without, to the knowledge of the receiving party, a breach of an obligation of confidentiality running directly or indirectly to the other party hereto; (c) has been approved for release by a written authorization by the other party hereto; (d) has been disclosed pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure, or is required to be disclosed by operation of law; (e) is independently developed by the receiving party without use, directly or indirectly, of the Information received from the other party hereto; or (f) is furnished to a third party by the disclosing party hereunder without restrictions on the third party's right to disclose the information.\n4.0 Nondisclosure Obligation\nEach party receiving any Information shall keep such Information confidential and shall not disclose such Information, in whole or in part, to any person other than its representatives who need to know such Information in connection with the receiving party's evaluation thereof and determination of business strategies, or other actions in connection with the Project (it being agreed and understood that such representatives shall be informed by the receiving party of the confidential nature of the Information and shall be required by the receiving party to agree to treat the Information confidentially), except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto or as otherwise permitted hereunder.\nVendor is strictly prohibited from placing any CVS Information on portable computing/storage devices, which are not owned and secured by Vendor. Vendor will take all reasonable, necessary, and appropriate measures, including encryption, to ensure that CVS Information stored on Vendor owned and secured devices cannot be accessed by unauthorized/inappropriate individuals. Vendor further agrees to monitor networks, systems, and physical plant for violations of this Agreement and to take the appropriate technical and procedural actions to ensure that any CVS Information is completely removed from any device, technologies, and/or locations in the event of any violation of security policy or procedure or any perceived infraction thereof. Vendor shall give CVS notice immediately if CVS Information has been accessed by unauthorized individuals or if there is any evidence of any such infraction.\n5.0 Development of Similar Technology\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, both parties acknowledge that each has and will have under development, both internally and through third-party vendors, various projects relating to the subject matter of the discussions and disclosures contemplated under this Agreement, including software development relating thereto. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict in any way either party's ability to pursue and develop such software, technology, products or services independently of the Information provided by the other party hereunder, without payment to the other party of any royalties, license fees or other amounts of any nature.\n6.0 Standard of Protection\nFor the purpose of complying with the obligations set forth herein, the party receiving any Information shall use efforts commensurate with those that such party employs for the protection of corresponding sensitive information of its own, and such receiving party shall not be liable for any inadvertent disclosure of Information provided that (i) it has used substantially the same degree of care to avoid disclosing such Information as it uses for its own information of like importance, and (ii) upon discovery of any inadvertent disclosure it shall use reasonable efforts to prevent further disclosure of such Information.\n7.0 Compliance with Legal Process\nIn the event that the party receiving any Information is legally requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, Civil Investigative Demand or similar process, or, in the opinion of counsel for such party, by federal or state securities or other statutes, regulations, or laws) to disclose any Information, such party shall promptly notify the other party of such requests or requirement prior to disclosure so that the other party may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If, however, in the opinion of counsel for the receiving party such party is nonetheless, in the absence of such order or waiver, compelled to disclose such Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer possible censure or other penalty or liability, then the receiving party may disclose such Information without liability to the other party hereunder.\n8.0 Ownership; Return of Information\nNo license to a party, under any trademark, patent, copyright, mask work protection right, or any other intellectual property right, is either granted or implied by the conveying of Information to such party. All Information (including tangible copies and computerized or electronic versions thereof), shall remain the property of the furnishing party. Within ten (10) days following the receipt of a written request referencing this Agreement and this paragraph from either party furnishing Information hereunder, the receiving party will deliver to the furnishing party all tangible materials containing or embodying the Information received from the furnishing party, except for materials containing Information which has been incorporated into analyses, compilations, comparisons, studies or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its representatives, together with a certificate executed by the receiving party certifying that all such materials in the receiving party's\npossession have been delivered to the furnishing party or destroyed. That portion of the Information which has been incorporated into analyses, compilations, comparisons, studies or other documents prepared by the receiving party or its representatives shall be held by the receiving party and kept confidential as provided above, or shall be destroyed.\n9.0 Remedies for Breach\nEach party understands and agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to remedy or forestall any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.\n10.0 No Representations or Further Obligations\nNeither this Agreement nor the disclosure or receipt of Information shall constitute or imply any promise or intention to make any purchase of products or services by either party or any commitment by either party with respect to the present or future marketing of any product or service. None of the Information which may be disclosed or exchanged by the parties shall constitute any representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee or inducement by either party to the other of any kind, and in particular, with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any Information or the non-infringement of trademarks, patents, copyrights, mask protection rights or any other intellectual property rights, or other rights of third persons or of either party. It is understood that this Agreement does not obligate either party to enter into any further agreements or to proceed with any possible relationship or other transaction.\n11.0 Term; Termination\nEither party may terminate the exchange of Information under this Agreement at any time by written notice to the other specifically referencing this Agreement. In any event, however, the obligations of each party to maintain the confidentiality of the Information it has received under this Agreement shall continue for the later to occur of (i) a period of three (3) years after such termination, or (ii) if this Agreement is incorporated by reference into another agreement between the parties, the term, including extensions, of that agreement, plus three (3) years.\n12.0 No Waiver\nNo failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n13.0 Amendment\nThis Agreement may not be modified, supplemented, or amended orally, but only by a writing signed by both parties hereto.\n14.0 Governing Law\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its choice of law provisions.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed and delivered this Non-Disclosure Agreement effective as of the date of execution by the last party to execute this Agreement, as set forth below.\nCVS Pharmacy, Inc.

Confidential Information. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes all business, financial, contractual, marketing and/or technical information, in whatever form embodied, which has been or may be disclosed, or to which access is provided, by a party (\u201cDiscloser\u201d) to the other party to this Agreement (\u201cRecipient\u201d), which (a) if in writing, is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d, \u201cproprietary\u201d or other similar marking at the time of disclosure, or (b) if provided orally or visually, is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and confirmed in writing to Recipient within 15 days of such disclosure.\nRecipient may disclose Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information to Recipient\u2019s affiliates on the condition that Recipient shall restrict access to Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information to those of Recipient\u2019s affiliates\u2019 officers, directors and employees who have a legitimate need-to-know to carry out the Purpose and who are obligated to protect such Confidential Information pursuant to terms and conditions no less protective of Discloser than those contained in this Agreement and Recipient shall be liable for any failure of its affiliates to abide by the provisions of this Agreement as if such failure was the act or omission of such party.\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \u201caffiliate\u201d means an entity that, as of Effective Date, directly or indirectly, controls or is under common control with a party to this Agreement, but only for so long as such control exists, and where \u201ccontrol\u201d shall mean ownership of more than 50% of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for the election of directors or an equivalent governing body.\n2. Nondisclosure and Nonuse Obligations. Each of the parties, as Recipient, hereby promises and agrees to receive and hold Confidential Information in confidence, and to protect and safeguard Confidential Information against unauthorized use or disclosure using at least the same degree of care as Recipient accords to its own confidential information of like importance, but in no case less than reasonable care. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party, as Recipient, further promises and agrees:\n(a) not to, directly or indirectly, in any way, disclose, make accessible, reveal, report, publish, disseminate or transfer any Confidential Information to any third party;\n(b) not to use any Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever, except in furtherance of the Purpose in accordance with this Agreement; and\n(c) to restrict access to Confidential Information to those of its officers, directors and employees who have a legitimate need-to-know to carry out the Purpose and who are obligated to protect such Confidential Information pursuant to terms and conditions no less protective of Discloser than those contained in this Agreement; and\n(d) not to reproduce or copy Confidential Information except to the extent necessary to further the Purpose.\nFurthermore, the existence of any business negotiations, discussions or agreements in progress between the parties shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed without written approval of all the parties. For the purposes of this Agreement, Company shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other division, department, group, or unit other than Samsung KNOX Business and Technology Division.\n3.

Ownership and Return of Confidential Information. Confidential Information disclosed by Discloser shall remain the property of such Discloser, and no license or other rights to such Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information is granted or implied hereby. Recipient shall reproduce the symbols, legends or other proprietary notices affixed to Confidential Information, and shall not, nor permit any third party to, remove, add or modify the same.\nRecipient shall, upon termination of this Agreement, or upon written request of Discloser, whichever is earlier, immediately, but not later than 10 days after any notice thereof by Discloser, return (or destroy at Discloser\u2019s option) all copies of such Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information and certify in writing its compliance with this requirement, except that Recipient may retain a copy of such Confidential Information solely for archival purpose.\n5. No Reverse Engineering. No party, as Recipient, will decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or attempt to reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, techniques or algorithms in Confidential Information by any means whatever, except as may be specifically authorized in advance by Discloser in writing.\n6. No Warranty. Confidential Information is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding such Confidential Information. Nothing herein shall be construed as a commitment by any party to disclose any Confidential Information, to commence or continue negotiations or to enter into any contract or business relationship. Neither this Agreement, nor the disclosure or receipt of Confidential Information, shall constitute or imply any promise or intention by any of the parties or their affiliates to develop, make, purchase or sell any present or future products or services. Any commitment to do or promise any of the foregoing must be in a separate writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. If any such agreement contains warranty provisions, those provisions shall prevail over the corresponding provisions in this Agreement. Each party shall bear its own fees, costs and expenses incurred in carrying out, or otherwise in relation to, this Agreement.\n7. Independent Development. This Agreement shall not preclude or limit the independent development by or on behalf of any party of any products or systems involving technology or information of a similar nature to that disclosed hereunder or which compete with products or systems contemplated by such information, provided that it is done without use of or reliance upon the other party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n8. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall be effective from the Effective Date until 24 months thereafter.

However, any termination of this Agreement shall not relieve Recipient of its confidentiality and use obligations with respect to Confidential Information disclosed prior to the date of such termination. Except for the right to use Confidential Information for the Purpose, which right terminates when this Agreement terminates, Recipient\u2019s duty to protect Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information expires 5 years from the date on which that Confidential Information was disclosed to Recipient. Sections 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n9. Contacts.

Remedies. Each party acknowledges that any disclosure, use or misappropriation of Confidential Information of another party in violation of this Agreement would cause such party irreparable harm for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, each party agrees that such other party shall have the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief and specific performance, without prejudice to any remedies available to it at law or in equity.\n12. Assignment. No party shall be entitled to assign, transfer or convey this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to do so without such consent shall be void.\n13. No Waiver. No claim, right or remedy of a party under this Agreement shall be deemed to be waived in whole or in part unless such waiver is in writing and signed. No relaxation, forbearance, delay or indulgence by a party in enforcing any of the provisions of this Agreement shall prejudice, affect or restrict the rights of that party under this Agreement, nor shall any waiver by a party of a violation of this Agreement operate as a waiver of any subsequent or continuing violation.\n14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (i) that provision shall be deemed amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision, and (ii) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired thereby.\n15. Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea (excluding conflict of laws provisions which may direct the application of another jurisdiction\u2019s laws). All disputes, controversies or claims between the parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement (including its existence, validity or termination) shall be finally resolved by arbitration to be held in Seoul, Korea and conducted in English under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce; provided, however, that each party may enforce its or its affiliates\u2019 intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to equitable relief. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n12.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for a claim in respect of any Consequential Loss.\n12.2 Neither Party shall be liable for consequential damages sustained by the other or a Permitted Person as a direct or indirect result of any material breach of any warranty, representation or undertaking given by that Party in terms of this Agreement, unless:\n12.2.1 legal or arbitration proceedings against the defaulting party in respect of each such claim is instituted by no later than the date of expiry of [24] months after the Effective Date;\n12.2.2 the other party's liability in respect of such claim (together with any connected claims) exceeds R 1 million; and\n12.2.3 and until the amount of the defaulting party's liability in respect of such claim (together with any connected claims), when aggregated with that party's liability for all substantiated claims that are not excluded under clause 12.2.2, exceeds R 1 million, in which case the defaulting party shall be liable for the whole amount claimed (and not just the amount by which the threshold in this clause 12.2.2 is exceeded).\n12.3 For the purposes of this clause 12, a claim is connected with another claim if the claims arise from the same event or set of circumstances, or relate to the same subject matter.\n12.4 Any claim by a Party under this Agreement shall be reduced by the aggregate of:\n12.4.1 an amount equal to any tax benefit received by that Party as a result thereof, based on the tax rate applicable at the time;\n12.4.2 an amount recovered or recoverable by that Party from any third party in respect thereof;\n12.4.3 any amount recovered or recoverable by that Party under any insurance policy;\n12.4.4 any amount by which the subject matter of the claim has been or is made good or otherwise compensated for without cost to the Recipient or permitted person; and\n12.4.5 Any amounts available for set-off or otherwise liable to be deducted pursuant to clause 12.4 shall first be taken into account for the purpose of determining the loss sustained in connection with the limits referred to in clause 12.2.2\n12.5 Nothing in this clause 12 shall in any way diminish or abrogate the a Party\u2019s obligation or other duty under any Applicable Laws to mitigate its losses or damages including, without limitation, enforcing against any person (other than disclosing party) any rights any member of the defaulting party\u2019s Group has or may have in respect of the fact, matter or circumstance giving rise to the claim.\n12.6 Despite anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, a Claim by a Party shall not entitle that Party to recover any amount from the defaulting party in respect of more than one of such breach of representations, undertakings, warranties or indemnities, where such additional breach of representations and claim arises from or is attributable to the same cause of action.\n12.7 The provisions of this clause 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n13. RETURN OF INFORMATION\n13.1 The Disclosing Party may, at any time, request the Receiving Party to return any material containing, pertaining to or relating to Confidential Information and may, in addition request the Receiving Party to furnish a written statement to the effect that, upon such return, the Receiving Party has not retained in its possession, or under its control, either directly or indirectly, any such material.\n13.2 As an alternative to the return of the material contemplated in 7.1 above, the Receiving Party shall, at the instance of the disclosing parties, destroy, delete or procure the deletion of all Confidential Information from any computer, word processor or other device in the possession or control of the Recipient or any permitted person and furnish to the Disclosing Party with a written statement to the effect that such material has been destroyed or deleted.\n13.3 The Receiving Party shall comply with a request, in terms of this clause 13, within 10 (ten) days of receipt of such a request.\n13.4 The Recipient shall not be required to return, destroy or delete Confidential Information to the extent that it is required to retain such Confidential Information by law or to satisfy the rules and regulations of a regulatory body to which the Recipient or any permitted person is subject. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of confidentiality contained in this Agreement will continue to apply to such retained Confidential Information.\n14. REPRESENTATIVES\nThe Recipient shall maintain and, upon request by the Disclosing Party, promptly provide a list containing the full name, title, location and function of each of its Representatives having access to or copies of the Confidential Information provided to it by the Disclosing Party.\n15. PUBLICITY\n15.1 Subject to in terms of clause 4, each Party undertakes to keep confidential and not to disclose to any third party, save as may be required in law (including by the rules and/or listings requirements of any securities exchange on which the securities of a Party or its Affiliates may be listed, where applicable) or permitted in terms of this Agreement, the nature, content or existence of this Agreement.\n15.2 No announcements of any nature whatsoever will be made by or on behalf of a Party relating to this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties, save for any announcement or other statement required to be made in terms of the provisions of any law (or by the rules and/or listings requirements of any securities exchange on which the on which the securities of a Party or its Affiliates may be listed, where applicable), in which event the Party obliged to make such statement will first consult with the other Parties to enable them in good faith to attempt to agree the content of such announcement, which (unless agreed) must go no further than is required in terms of such law or rules. This will not apply to a Party wishing to respond to another Party which has made an announcement of some nature in breach of this clause 15.2.\n15.3 This clause 15 shall not apply to any disclosure made by a Party to a Permitted Person, provided that they have agreed to the same confidentiality undertakings, or to any judicial or arbitral tribunal or officer, in connection with any matter relating to this Agreement or arising out of it.\n16. GENERAL WARRANTIES\n16.1 Each of the Parties hereby warrants to and in favour of the other that \u2013\n16.1.1 it has the legal capacity and has taken all necessary corporate action required to empower and authorise it to enter into this Agreement;\n16.1.2 this Agreement constitutes an agreement which is valid and binding on it, and against, it in accordance with its terms;\n16.1.3 the execution of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder does not and shall not \u2013\n16.1.3.1 contravene any law or regulation to which that Party is subject;\n16.1.3.2 contravene any provision of that Party's constitutional documents; or\n16.1.3.3 conflict with, or constitute a breach of any of the provisions of any other agreement, obligation, restriction or undertaking which is binding on it; and\n16.1.3.4 to the best of its knowledge and belief, it is not aware of the existence of any fact or circumstance that may impair its ability to comply with all of its obligations in terms of this Agreement;\n16.1.4 it is entering into this Agreement as principal (and not as agent or in any other capacity);\n16.1.5 the natural person who signs and executes this Agreement on its behalf is validly and duly authorised to do so;\n16.1.6 no other party is acting as a fiduciary for it; and\n16.1.7 it is not relying upon any statement or representation by or on behalf of any other Party, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n16.2 Each of the representations and warranties given by the Parties in terms of clause 16.1 shall \u2013\n16.2.1 be a separate warranty and will in no way be limited or restricted by inference from the terms of any other warranty or by any other words in this Agreement;\n16.2.2 continue and remain in force notwithstanding the completion of any or all the transactions contemplated in this Agreement; and\n16.2.3 prima facie be deemed to be material and to be a material representation inducing the other Party to enter into this Agreement.\n17. GOVERNING LAW\n17.1 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the law in the Republic of South Africa.\n17.2 The parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the North Gauteng High Court, Pretoria or its successor and they agree that all disputes arising from the conclusion or interpretation of this Agreement may be heard by such court.\n18. BREACH\n18.1 Without prejudice to the other rights of the Disclosing Party, in the event of any unauthorised disclosure or use of the Confidential Information which is or is reasonably likely to constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement, the Recipient shall, at the sole cost of the Recipient \u2013\n18.1.1 immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing and take such steps as the Disclosing Party may reasonably require in order to remedy or mitigate the effects of such actual or threatened breach; and;\n18.1.2 use all reasonable commercial endeavours to assist the Disclosing Party in recovering and preventing the use, dissemination, sale or other disposal of such Confidential Information.\n18.2 The Parties acknowledge and agree that \u2013\n18.2.1 cancellation is not an appropriate remedy for breach of this Agreement and this Agreement may not be cancelled or terminated save by written agreement between the Parties; and\n18.2.2 damages alone may not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the obligations set out in this Agreement and that the remedies of interdict, specific performance and any other equitable relief are appropriate for any threatened or actual breach of this Agreement. The Disclosing Party will be entitled to apply for such remedy, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law (other than the remedy of cancellation).\n18.3 Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party or any of its employees, professional advisors, agents and consultants of the provisions of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without prejudice to and in addition to any other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, to enforce the performance of the provisions of this Agreement by interdict or specific performance upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction without proof of actual damage and notwithstanding that in any particular case damages may be readily quantifiable, and the Receiving Party may not plead sufficiency of damages as a defence in any proceeding for injunc","mutual, confidentiality, nondisclosure, agreementnentered, betweenntransnet, soc, ltd, acting,

RETURN OF INFORMATION\n13.1 The Disclosing Party may, at any time, request the Receiving Party to return any material containing, pertaining to or relating to Confidential Information and may, in addition request the Receiving Party to furnish a written statement to the effect that, upon such return, the Receiving Party has not retained in its possession, or under its control, either directly or indirectly, any such material.\n13.2 As an alternative to the return of the material contemplated in 7.1 above, the Receiving Party shall, at the instance of the disclosing parties, destroy, delete or procure the deletion of all Confidential Information from any computer, word processor or other device in the possession or control of the Recipient or any permitted person and furnish to the Disclosing Party with a written statement to the effect that such material has been destroyed or deleted.\n13.3 The Receiving Party shall comply with a request, in terms of this clause 13, within 10 (ten) days of receipt of such a request.\n13.4 The Recipient shall not be required to return, destroy or delete Confidential Information to the extent that it is required to retain such Confidential Information by law or to satisfy the rules and regulations of a regulatory body to which the Recipient or any permitted person is subject.

REPRESENTATIVES\nThe Recipient shall maintain and, upon request by the Disclosing Party, promptly provide a list containing the full name, title, location and function of each of its Representatives having access to or copies of the Confidential Information provided to it by the Disclosing Party.\n15.

This will not apply to a Party wishing to respond to another Party which has made an announcement of some nature in breach of this clause 15.2.\n15.3 This clause 15 shall not apply to any disclosure made by a Party to a Permitted Person, provided that they have agreed to the same confidentiality undertakings, or to any judicial or arbitral tribunal or officer, in connection with any matter relating to this Agreement or arising out of it.\n16. GENERAL WARRANTIES\n16.1 Each of the Parties hereby warrants to and in favour of the other that \u2013\n16.1.1 it has the legal capacity and has taken all necessary corporate action required to empower and authorise it to enter into this Agreement;\n16.1.2 this Agreement constitutes an agreement which is valid and binding on it, and against, it in accordance with its terms;\n16.1.3 the execution of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder does not and shall not \u2013\n16.1.3.1 contravene any law or regulation to which that Party is subject;\n16.1.3.2 contravene any provision of that Party's constitutional documents; or\n16.1.3.3 conflict with, or constitute a breach of any of the provisions of any other agreement, obligation, restriction or undertaking which is binding on it; and\n16.1.3.4 to the best of its knowledge and belief, it is not aware of the existence of any fact or circumstance that may impair its ability to comply with all of its obligations in terms of this Agreement;\n16.1.4 it is entering into this Agreement as principal (and not as agent or in any other capacity);\n16.1.5 the natural person who signs and executes this Agreement on its behalf is validly and duly authorised to do so;\n16.1.6 no other party is acting as a fiduciary for it; and\n16.1.7 it is not relying upon any statement or representation by or on behalf of any other Party, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n16.2 Each of the representations and warranties given by the Parties in terms of clause 16.1 shall \u2013\n16.2.1 be a separate warranty and will in no way be limited or restricted by inference from the terms of any other warranty or by any other words in this Agreement;\n16.2.2 continue and remain in force notwithstanding the completion of any or all the transactions contemplated in this Agreement; and\n16.2.3 prima facie be deemed to be material and to be a material representation inducing the other Party to enter into this Agreement.\n17.

The Disclosing Party will be entitled to apply for such remedy, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law (other than the remedy of cancellation).\n18.3 Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party or any of its employees, professional advisors, agents and consultants of the provisions of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without prejudice to and in addition to any other rights or remedies under this Agreement or at law, to enforce the performance of the provisions of this Agreement by interdict or specific performance upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction without proof of actual damage and notwithstanding that in any particular case damages may be readily quantifiable, and the

"      MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nBY ACCEPTING THIS MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (\u201cAGREEMENT\u201d), EITHER BY CLICKING A BOX INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR BY EXECUTING A FORM THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT.\nThis Agreement was last updated on July 3, 2018. This Agreement is between the entity or individual entering into this Agreement (\u201cYou\u201d or \u201cYour\u201d) and BMC Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cBMC\u201d), located at 2103 CityWest Blvd., Houston, Texas 77042. A copy of this Agreement is posted at http://www.bmc.com/legal/agreements.html, where it can be saved and/or printed. It is effective between You and BMC as of the date of your acceptance of this Agreement.\n1. Scope. BMC and You (the \u201cParties\u201d) desire to disclose certain confidential information in connection with (a) an existing business relationship, (b) the discussion or validation of business proposals or design concepts, or (c) a future business relationship (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\n2. Discloser and Recipient. As to any particular Proprietary Information (defined below), the \u201cDiscloser\u201d is the Party disclosing the Proprietary Information and the \u201cRecipient\u201d is the Party receiving the Proprietary Information.\n3. Proprietary Information. \u201cProprietary Information\u201d means any confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information concerning Discloser\u2019s (a) customers\u2019 identity, finances, and data, and (b) personnel, business practices, business policies, the terms of any agreements between the Parties, pricing information, information relating to research and development, know-how, methodologies, inventions, specifications, software, market analyses, research strategies, projections, forecasts, proposal related documents and responses, data center and/or facility procedures and operations, data center and/or facility audit results, and compilations, summaries, analyses, copies, or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of the foregoing, except to the extent to which Recipient can establish by legally sufficient evidence that such information: (i) was rightfully in Recipient\u2019s possession without obligation of confidentiality before receipt from Discloser; (ii) is or has become a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient; (iii) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without violation of any duty of confidentiality; (iv) is or was independently developed by or for Recipient without use or reference to the Proprietary Information or (v) was disclosed by Discloser to a third party without an obligation of confidentiality. Subject to the foregoing exceptions, \u201cProprietary Information\u201d also includes, without limitation, third-party information that Discloser has the right to disclose to Recipient. Nothing disclosed under this Agreement is considered Proprietary Information unless (a) it is received in a tangible form and is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d, (b) is received in intangible form and is followed up within a reasonable period of time with a writing describing it and designating it as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d, or (c) it is something by either the substance of which or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure would lead a reasonable person to believe it is confidential or proprietary.\n4. Restrictions on Use and Non-Disclosure of Proprietary Information. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in writing by an authorized representative of Discloser, Recipient may not:\n(a) use the Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to further the business relationship of the Parties and for the sole benefit of Discloser; or\n(b) directly or indirectly disclose Proprietary Information to any person or entity other than Recipient\u2019s employees and consultants who (i) have a need to know in order to fulfill the Purpose, (ii) have been advised of the Proprietary Information\u2019s confidential status, and (iii) are subject to legally binding obligations of confidentiality as to such Proprietary Information, which are no less restrictive than those contained in this Agreement, provided, that Recipient is at all times fully responsible to Discloser for compliance with this Agreement by such employees and consultants.\n5. Standard of Care. Recipient shall use at least the same degree (but no less than a reasonable degree) of care and protection to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of any Proprietary Information as Recipient uses to protect its own confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.\n6. Ownership; Suggestions. Recipient may not assert any claim of title or ownership to the Proprietary Information or any portion thereof. In the course of the discussions facilitated in the Customer Program, You may be providing to BMC feedback and suggestions relevant to the functionality, performance, features, and operation of BMC\u2019s products and services (\u201cSuggestions\u201d) the purpose of their disclosure being to assist BMC and its affiliates to deliver BMC products that include the functionality, performance, features, and operation in BMC products that You need and desire to have. In order for BMC to be able to act on such Suggestions, BMC needs to have Your permission to do something with Your Suggestions, therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, You hereby assign to BMC all rights, title and interest in the Suggestions and in all intellectual property therein. Although not usually necessary, if requested by BMC, You agree to execute such further instruments as BMC may reasonably request confirming BMC\u2019s ownership in Your Suggestions.\n7. Disclosures Required by Law. In the event Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any Proprietary Information, Recipient shall provide Discloser with prior written notice of such requirement as soon as Recipient becomes aware of such requirement, such that Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if Discloser waives in writing compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Recipient agrees to (a) furnish only that portion of the Proprietary Information which Recipient is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be furnished and (b) exercise reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of the portion of Proprietary Information that is furnished.\n8. Confidentiality Period. Recipient\u2019s obligations under paragraphs 3 through 5 expire on the earlier of (a) notification from the Discloser that the Proprietary Information is no longer confidential, or (b) the Parties\u2019 entry into a separate, subsequent agreement that contains confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions that supersede this Agreement as to that Proprietary Information.\n9. No Liability. Discloser makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the quality, accuracy, and completeness of the Proprietary Information, and neither Discloser nor its representatives have any liability whatsoever with respect to Recipient\u2019s use of or reliance upon the Proprietary Information.\n10. Disposal of Proprietary Information. Recipient agrees to destroy or return to Discloser all copies of Proprietary Information promptly upon the earlier of (a) Discloser\u2019s request at any time, or (b) the duration of the confidentiality period established in Section 8(a) of this Agreement.\n11. Data Protection. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Parties may share contact details such as name, mail address, email address, telephone numbers, etc., in connection with the Purpose (\u201cContact Details\u201d). Such Contact Details may be considered personal data under applicable data protection laws. The Parties acknowledge that one party may disclose Personal Data to the other party, and each party shall comply with its obligations as a data controller under applicable data protection laws. In particular, each party shall:\n(a) ensure that it may lawfully transfer Contact Details to the other party;\n(b) inform employees, consultants or potential employees, consultants of the transfer to the other party;\n(c) process the Contact Details only pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with applicable data protection laws;\n(d) ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of Contact Details and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, the Contact Details;\n(e) provide reasonable assistance to the other party in complying with applicable data protection laws; and\n(f) delete or return to the other party upon request all Contact Details, including copies, unless legally prohibited.\n12. Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a breach of this Agreement by either Party may cause irreparable injury to the other\u2019s business as a result of any such violation, for which the remedies at law may be inadequate, and that Discloser is therefore entitled to seek, in addition to any other remedies available to Discloser, a temporary restraining order and injunctive relief against Recipient, provided the Discloser can meet the legal requirements therefor.\n13. Miscellaneous. No failure, delay, or single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement by either Party is a waiver of such right. This Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing by the Parties expressly modifying or waiving any provision of this Agreement. Neither the provision of Proprietary Information under this Agreement nor the execution of this Agreement binds or obligates either Party to any business relationship, and neither Party is bound or obligated to any such relationship with the other Party until the Parties execute a binding written agreement specifically describing such relationship. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will be unaffected and remain in effect. Any additional documents presented to a BMC representative by Customer for signature as a condition for going on a Customer\u2019s site will be governed by this Agreement and to the extent that such document presents additional terms or conflicts with this Agreement, it shall be considered null and void.\n14. Compliance with Law.

The information to be exchanged is confidential and proprietary in nature, and the parties wish to maintain the confidential nature of such information and limit the receiving party's use and disclosure of such information as forth set forth in this Agreement.\nAgreement\nIn consideration of the mutual covenants and promises set forth in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\n1. References to \""Confidential Information\"" mean all knowledge, information or materials whether of a technical or financial nature or otherwise relating to the business or affairs of the Parties (including without limitation any subsidiary or affiliated entity thereof), including all memoranda, notes, analyses, compilations, studies and other materials prepared by or for the receiving party which contain or reflect such knowledge, information or materials, which is provided or disclosed by the disclosing party to the receiving party in connection with the Opportunity and identified at the time of such disclosure as being confidential; provided that Confidential Information shall not include:\n(a) information which the receiving party can demonstrate was known to the receiving party prior to disclosure by the disclosing party;\n(b) information which is in the public domain or which enters the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement; or\n(c) information that the receiving party independently develops or independently becomes aware of from a third party without, to the knowledge of the receiving party, a duty of confidentiality to the disclosing party.\n2. The receiving party agrees that it will at all times maintain the confidentiality of any Confidential Information communicated to it by or on behalf of the disclosing party; provided that in the event the receiving party becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, requests for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information, or the receiving party determines that it is obligated by statute or governmental regulation to disclose any of the Confidential Information, the receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the disclosing party, if possible, may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the receiving party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is advised by counsel is legally required to be furnished and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information\n3. Except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, the receiving party agrees that it shall not copy, adapt, divulge, publish, disclose, or circulate (or authorize or permit anyone else to adapt, divulge, publish, disclose or circulate) any of the Confidential Information disclosed or communicated to it by the disclosing party (except as described in paragraph 4), nor shall it use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Opportunity.\n4. Confidential Information may be disclosed by the receiving party to its employees, directors, officers, advisors, attorneys, auditors and agents only on a need-to-know basis in connection with the Opportunity, and each employee, director, officer, advisor, attorney, auditor or agent to whom Confidential Information is disclosed shall treat such Confidential Information in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The receiving party shall be liable for all acts and omissions of each person and entity to which the receiving party discloses Confidential Information.\n5. The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of five years beginning on the date hereof; provided that the obligations relating to Confidential Information disclosed during the term of this Agreement shall survive the expiration of this Agreement.\n6. All right, title and interest in and to the Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of the disclosing party and the Confidential Information shall be held in trust and confidence by the receiving party for the disclosing party. No interest, license or any right respecting the Confidential Information, other than set out herein, is granted to the receiving party hereunder by implication or otherwise.\n7. The Confidential Information shall not be copied, reproduced in any form or stored in a retrieval system or data base by the receiving party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, except for such copies and storage as may reasonably be required internally by the receiving party in connection with the Opportunity. The receiving party hereby agrees that all Confidential Information (including all copies thereof) disclosed to or created by the receiving party shall be delivered forthwith by the receiving party to the disclosing party, or, at the election of the receiving party, destroyed, and deleted from all retrieval systems and data bases upon the earlier of a request at any time by the disclosing party or at any time the receiving party decides not to proceed with a possible transaction involving the disclosing party.\n8. The receiving party shall not directly or indirectly contact any shareholders, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, lending institutions, customers or suppliers of the disclosing party in connection with a possible transaction involving the disclosing party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n9. The disclosing party shall at its discretion provide such of the Confidential Information to the receiving party as is necessary or appropriate in connection with the Opportunity. Nothing in this Agreement obligates the disclosing party to make any particular disclosure of Confidential Information. The receiving party acknowledges and agrees that no representations or warranties whatsoever, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information have been made by the disclosing party. The receiving party acknowledges and agrees that neither the disclosing party nor any of its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives or professional advisors will have any liability to the receiving party resulting from its use of the Confidential Information or from any errors or omissions in the Confidential Information. Only those representations and warranties which are made in a final definitive agreement regarding the proposed transaction with the disclosing party, when, as and if executed, will have any legal effect.\n10. The receiving party acknowledges that it is aware and that it will advise its employees and agents who are given access to the Confidential Information that the securities laws of the United States impose certain restrictions with respect to the purchase and sale of securities of an issuer by a person who has received material non-public information from such issuer concerning the matters referred to herein and by persons who have received such non-public information from such person.\n11. The receiving party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the disclosing party and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives and professional advisors from any damage, loss, cost or liability (including reasonable legal fees and the cost of enforcing this Agreement) owed to a third party arising out of the breach by the receiving party of this Agreement.\n12. The receiving party agrees and acknowledges that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the receiving party or any of its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives or professional advisors and that the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies are not the exclusive remedies for a breach by the receiving party, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the disclosing party.\n13. The parties agree that unless and until a final definitive agreement regarding a transaction between the parties has been executed and delivered, neither of the parties will be under any obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction by virtue of this Agreement except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that the other party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any and all proposals with regard to a transaction between the parties and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time.\n14. Each party agrees to keep the existence and terms of this Agreement, and that the parties are having discussions related to the Opportunity, strictly confidential, and will not disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement, or that such discussions are taking place, to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party.\n15. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver hereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n16. Execution and delivery of a facsimile transmission or email transmission of this Agreement shall constitute, for purposes of this Agreement, delivery of an executed original and shall be binding on the parties.\n17. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had either not been included or had been\u200b \u200blimited to the extent of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, so that this Agreement shall be carried out as closely as possible according to its original terms.\n18. Each party represents and warrants that (i) such party is an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its state of organization, (ii) such party has the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform fully its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) such party is under no contractual or other legal obligation which might interfere in any way with its prompt and complete performance under this Agreement; and (iv) the person executing this Agreement on behalf of such party has been duly authorized to do so and such execution is binding upon such party.\n19. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, express and implied, oral and written. This Agreement is neither intended to nor shall it be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership or other form of business association between the parties, or any obligation of the parties to enter into any agreement relating to the Opportunity. This Agreement may not be modified or amended other than by an agreement in writing, signed by the parties.\n20. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, \u200bthe parties have executed this Agreement on the date first set forth above.\n___________________(COMPANY NAME): THE KNIGHTS:\nBy: By:\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title: Co-owner\nDate: Date:\n"",","mutual, nondisclosure,

AGX and CANDIDATE desire to exchange information and to engage in discussions concerning AGX\u2019s agent program and Candidate\u2019s qualifications to establish a freight Agency Relationship. In the course of such discussions and negotiations, it is anticipated that a Party (\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) may disclose or otherwise make available to the other Party (\u201cReceiving Party\u201d) certain confidential and proprietary information for the purpose of enabling the Receiving Party to evaluate and the prospective business relationship (the \u201cNDA Purpose\u201d). The Parties have entered into this Agreement in order to ensure the confidentiality and proper protection of such confidential and proprietary information.\n2. Confidential Information. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all information that is not generally known or readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons and is either (i) designated as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d by the Disclosing Party prior to or at the time of disclosure or (ii) information that a reasonable person should recognize as being confidential or proprietary, based on the nature of the information and/or the circumstances of its disclosure. By way of example, Confidential Information includes, without limitation, information regarding a Party\u2019s products, product development, services, agreements and contracts, business operations, business plans and financial affairs; employees and other personnel; vendors and customers; marketing plans and strategies; processes, compensation formulas, methods and specifications; and information technology network. Additionally, the fact of the Parties discussions regarding a potential business relationship shall be deemed Confidential Information subject to the protections of this Agreement. Confidential Information may be either the property of the Disclosing Party or information provided to the Disclosing Party by a third party.\n4. Disclosure and Protection of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall (i) hold all Confidential Information in confidence, and shall not disclose Confidential Information except as expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement and (ii) use Confidential Information only for the NDA Purpose and for no other purpose without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party.\n5.

The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date set forth below and shall continue for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter.\n6. Limitation on Obligations. The obligations of the Receiving Party with respect to the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information shall not apply with respect to any Confidential Information to the extent the Receiving Party can demonstrate that such Confidential Information: (a) is generally known to the public at the time of disclosure or becomes generally known through no breach of this Agreement; (b) is in the Receiving Party\u2019s rightful possession at the time of disclosure without an obligation to hold it in confidence; (c) becomes known to the Receiving Party without obligation of confidence through disclosure by a third party having the legal right to disclose such information; (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without access or reference to, or reliance upon, the Confidential Information; or (e) is or becomes disclosed through the ordinary course of the NDA Purpose or as an element of any marketing plan intended to be released in the public domain or to targeted geographic public domain.\n7. Return of Documents. The Receiving Party shall, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, return to the Disclosing Party or, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s direction, destroy all documents and any and all other tangible manifestations of Confidential Information received or created by the Receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement (and all copies and reproductions thereof).\nAAGEX FREIGHT GROUP, LLC AGENT CANDIDATE\nSignature: Mike Williams Signature:\nDate: Date: ___________________________\n"",","mutual, nondisclosure, agreementnthank, visiting, website, interest, learning, opportunity, organization, interested, learning, younthis, mutual, nondisclosure, agreement, u201cagreementu201d, entered, aagex, freight, group, llc, u201cagxu201d, party, identified, agent, candidate, u201ccandidateu201d, agx, candidate, may, referred, herein, individually, u201cpartyu201d, jointly, u201cpartiesu201dn1, background, agx, candidate, desire, exchange, information, engage, discussion, concerning, agxu2019s, agent, program, candidateu2019s, qualification, establish, freight, agency, relationship, course, discussion, negotiation, anticipated, party, u201cdisclosing, partyu201d, may, disclose, otherwise, make, available, party, u201creceiving, partyu201d, certain, confidential, proprietary, information, purpose, enabling, receiving, party, evaluate, prospective, business, relationship, u201cnda, purposeu201d, party, entered, agreement, order, ensure, confidentiality, proper, protection, confidential, proprietary, informationn2, confidential, information, used, agreement, term, u201cconfidential, informationu201d, shall, mean, information, generally, known, readily, ascertainable, proper, mean, person, either, designated, u201cconfidentialu201d, u201cproprietaryu201d, disclosing, party, prior, time, disclosure, ii, information, reasonable, person, recognize, confidential, proprietary, based, nature, information, andor, circumstance, disclosure, way, example, confidential, information, includes, without, limitation, information, regarding, partyu2019s, product, product, development, service, agreement, contract, business, operation, business, plan, financial, affair, employee, personnel, vendor, customer, marketing, plan, strategy, process, compensation, formula, method, specification, information, technology, network, additionally, fact, party, discussion, regarding, potential, business, relationship, shall, deemed, confidential, information, subject, protection, agreement, confidential, information, may, either, property, disclosing, party, information, provided, disclosing, party, third, partyn4, disclosure, protection, confidential, information, receiving, party, shall, hold, confidential, information, confidence, shall, disclose, confidential, information, except, expressly, permitted, term, agreement, ii, use, confidential, information, nda, purpose, purpose, without, prior, written, consent, disclosing, partyn5, scope, term, agreement, agreement, pertains, confidential, information, disclosed, otherwise, made, available, disclosing, party, affiliate, receiving, party, connection, nda, purpose, whether, prior, term, agreement, term, agreement, shall, commence, effective, date, set, forth, shall, continue, period, twelve, 12, month, thereaftern6, limitation, obligation, obligation, receiving, party, respect, disclosing, partyu2019s, confidential, information, shall, apply, respect, confidential, information, extent, receiving, party, demonstrate, confidential, information, generally, known, public, time, disclosure, becomes, generally, known, breach, agreement, b, receiving, partyu2019s, rightful, possession, time, disclosure, without, obligation, hold, confidence, c, becomes, known, receiving, party, without, obligation, confidence, disclosure, third, party, legal, right, disclose, information, independently, developed, receiving, party, without, access, reference, reliance, upon, confidential, information, e, becomes, disclosed, ordinary, course, nda, purpose, element, marketing, plan, intended, released, public, domain, targeted, geographic, public, domainn7, return, document, receiving, party, shall, upon, written, request, disclosing, party, return, disclosing, party, disclosing, partyu2019s, direction, destroy, document, tangible, manifestation, confidential, information, received, created, receiving, party, pursuant, agreement, copy, reproduction, thereofnaagex, freight, group, llc, agent, candidatensignature, mike, williams, signaturendate, date, n"

"      MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made and entered into by and among:\nBusiness Innovation Group Limited (A.C.N. 165 042 517) of The University Centre, Level 8, 210 Clarence Street, Sydney Australia 2000 (\u201cBiG\u201d)\nand:\n with offices located at\n . (\u201cThe Company\u201d).\nEffective as of the ________________ day of _________________ 2013 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\nWHEREAS, in the course of business discussions, The Company and BiG (each a \u201cParty\u201d and together the \u201cParties\u201d) shall disclose certain confidential and proprietary information to each other in connection with a proposed business relationship between The Company and BiG (the \u201cTransaction\u201d); and\nWHEREAS, as a condition to such exchange, each Party (each, a \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) seeks to bind the other Party (each, a \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) to obligations of confidentiality and limited use with respect to the information it discloses.\nNOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual agreements contained herein and the agreement to exchange information as contemplated hereunder, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information means any tangible or intangible information or materials possessed by a Party in whatever form or format relating to the Disclosing Party or its actual or proposed information systems, other business, financial or accounting systems, business procedures or methods, business plans, financial products, marketing plans, results of operations, customers, markets, prospective customers, contracts (actual and proposed) with third parties or personnel directly or indirectly disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party during or in the course of discussions or correspondence arising out of or related to the Transaction whether received before or after the Effective Date. Confidential Information includes all information owned by a third party and disclosed by a Disclosing Party hereunder.\n2. Confidential Information does not include information that (i) was in the Receiving Party\u2019s possession prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; or (ii) is or later becomes generally available to the public through no fault of the Receiving Party; or (iii) Receiving Party develops internally without benefit of or reference to Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information (burden of proving independent development shall be on the Receiving Party); or (iv) Receiving Party receives from a third party who has the right to disclose such information.\n3. The Receiving Party agrees (i) to adopt measures to protect the confidentiality, limited use and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information at least as restrictive as those it adopts for its own confidential information of similar importance and in any event, no less than reasonable; (ii) to disclose Confidential Information to only those of its directors, officers, agents, employees, corporate affiliates and third parties retained by the Receiving Party who have a need to know such information in order for the Receiving Party to accomplish the purposes set forth in Paragraph 4 hereof and who are made aware of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement (and in the case of a third party, who have signed a binding undertaking of confidentiality and non-use substantially equivalent to this Agreement), and (iii) to not use Confidential Information for any purpose except as permitted by Paragraph 4. A Receiving Party shall be responsible to the Disclosing Party for any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by any party to whom Receiving Party has disclosed such information.\n4. The Receiving Party may use the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information for the sole purpose of evaluating, negotiating and, in its discretion, entering into the proposed Transaction. A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a request by an applicable regulatory authority, or if they are required by law or pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose Confidential Information, provided, however, in such event the Receiving Party shall (i) promptly notify the Disclosing Party; (ii) consult with the Disclosing Party as to the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow such request; and (iii) if so requested, cooperate with the Disclosing Party in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy.\n5. The Parties shall promptly advise each other in writing if they learn of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by any of their directors, officers, employees, corporate affiliates, agents or by any third party.\n6. The Parties agree that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement, monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy and in addition to any other legal remedy, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to equitable remedies, including injunctive relief. In the event that any Party takes legal action as a result of a breach of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to recover reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with such legal action in the event that it prevails in one or more of its claims.\n7. The provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect beginning as of the Effective Date and shall continue with respect to a Receiving Party for as long as it retains the Confidential Information in its possession and for three (3) years thereafter. A receiving Party shall return or destroy all copies of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party within ten (10) days after the Disclosing Party\u2019s request.\n8. No Party may assign its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party. This Agreement will be binding upon the successors, heirs and permitted assigns of the Parties.\n9. This Agreement expresses the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior understandings and discussions between the Parties. This Agreement may only be modified, changed or amended by an agreement in writing executed by the Parties. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision and shall not be binding unless it is in writing and executed by the Party making such waiver.\n10. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.\n11. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of New South Wales for the time being in force and the Parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales, the Federal Court and the High Court of Australia, Sydney Registries.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties to this Agreement have duly executed this Agreement by their duly

Waiver. The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement shall not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights.\n12. Governing Law.

The parties consent to the exercise by such courts of personal jurisdiction over them and each party waives any objection it might otherwise have to venue, personal jurisdiction, inconvenience of forum, and any similar or related doctrine.\n10. Remedies.\nRecipient agrees that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Sanmina and Sanmina\u2019s business, and expressly agrees that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate Sanmina for any breach by either party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Recipient agrees and acknowledges that any such violation or threatened violation will cause irreparable injury to Sanmina and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in law, in equity or otherwise, Sanmina will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without the necessity of posting bond.\n11.

DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n1.1 Definition. The term \""Confidential Information\"" shall include and mean any and all information, data, product plans, diagrams and know-how programs furnished at any time by the Disclosing Party or by any of its affiliates to the Receiving Party; whether in oral, written, graphic or machine-readable form, including but not limited to current or projected components, parts, software, hardware, technical and other data, research material, inventions, discoveries, designs, drawings, concepts, procedures, uses of materials, ideas, diagrams, marketing plans, brochures, photographs, processes, combinations, test equipment, test data, specifications, operational data, models, prototypes, materials, methods and techniques.\n1.2 Exclusions. The following shall not be considered Confidential Information: (a) information that was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed; (b) information that can be demonstrated by documentary evidence to have been known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure with no obligation of confidence; and (c) information that becomes known to the Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party, as demonstrated by appropriate documentation, without breach of any obligation of confidence by the Receiving Party; for the avoidance of doubt it is clarified and agreed that the combination of any two materials or use thereof for a certain purpose shall be considered \""Confidential Information\"" to the extent that such specific combination for such specific purpose is not excluded from the Confidential Information under the provisions of this Section 1.2, whether or not the individual, uncombined materials or use thereof are so excluded.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information contains valuable trade and technical secrets of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall not copy (in whole or in part), sell, assign, lease, license, disclose, give or otherwise transfer the Confidential Information or any copy thereof to any third party or otherwise use the Confidential Information other than for the purpose intended under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information only to employees or consultants of the Receiving Party to have a \u201cneed to know\u201d the Confidential Information in order to enable the Receiving Party to use the Confidential Information for the purpose intended under this Agreement and are legally bound not to use or disclose the Confidential Information for any other purpose. The Receiving Party shall treat the Confidential Information with the same degree of confidentiality as it keeps its own confidential information, but in all events no less than a reasonable degree of confidentiality. This obligation shall be binding on all employees, officers, subsidiaries, affiliates or successors of the Receiving Party and shall continue for a period of five years from the date that the Confidential Information is provided to the Receiving Party, regardless of whether the Agreement has been terminated. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information if so required by judicial or administrative process, provided that it shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party so as to allow the Disclosing Party reasonable time to oppose such process, and provided that Receiving Party shall minimize such disclosure to the extent possible.\n3. PROPRIETARY NATURE.\n3.1 Ownership. All Confidential Information is and shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. The parties acknowledge that all Confidential Information is the sole property of the Disclosing Party and that the Receiving Party shall not acquire any proprietary interest in the Confidential Information.

Except as may otherwise be set forth in another signed, written agreement between parties, the Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty as to accuracy, completeness, condition, suitability, patentability or performance of the Confidential Information, and the Disclosing Party shall have no liability whatsoever to the Receiving Party resulting from its use of the Confidential Information.\n4. TERMINATION. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by written notice to the other party. Upon such termination or other expiration of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will return all of the Confidential Information in written or other tangible form, including any copies made, to the Disclosing Party together with certification that any other copies or notes or summaries (to the extent including the Confidential Information) have been destroyed. The provisions of Sections 1 through 5 of this Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration.\n5. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The parties acknowledges that a Disclosing Party will be irreparably harmed if the Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement are not specifically enforced and that the Disclosing Party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of an actual or threatened violation by the Receiving Party of the Receiving Party's obligations. Therefore, in addition to all other remedies it may have, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to an injunction or any appropriate decree of specific performance for any actual or threatened violations or breaches by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party's employees or agents without the necessity of the Disclosing Party showing actual damages or that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy, and without posting a bond.\n6. MISCELLANEOUS. Neither party shall assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party; failure by a party to enforce any provisions of this Agreement at any time shall in no manner affect the right of that party at a later time to enforce any provision of this Agreement; this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England without reference to the principles of conflict of laws; in the event that any word, phrase, clause, sentence or other provision herein shall violate any applicable statute, ordinance or rule of law in any jurisdiction which governs this Agreement, such provisions shall be effective to the extent of such violation without invalidating any other provision herein; this Agreement supersedes all previous understandings or agreements between the parties and incorporates the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the receipt and use of the Confidential Information; this Agreement may only be amended by a writing of subsequent date that is signed by both parties.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of

The University is working with Dstl as part of the University Defence Research Centre (UDRC) on signal processing and both possess valuable technical information in the field of signal processing.\nB. The Company possesses valuable technical and commercial information relating to signal processing.\nC. The Parties desire to discuss and mutually assess and evaluate their valuable technical and commercial information with a view to investigating whether there is a synergy between the Parties\u2019 technical capabilities which might benefit from mutual exploitation (\""the Purpose\"").\nD. In order for the Parties to carry out said discussion, assessment and evaluation it is necessary for them to exchange valuable technical and commercial information which they each desire to protect.\nNOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED BETWEEN THE PARTIES as follows:\n1. As used in this Agreement the term \""Proprietary Information\"" shall mean any information, whether in writing or other documentary form, in oral or visual or machine readable form, or in the form of algorithms, samples or models, disclosed by one Party (the \""Disclosing Party\"") to another Party (the \""Receiving Party\"") under this Agreement, provided that:\n(a) where such information is in writing or other documentary form, it is clearly and conspicuously marked at the time of disclosure as proprietary or commercially sensitive (for example with a marking such as \""Proprietary\"" or \""Commercial-in-Confidence\"").; or\n(b) where such information is disclosed in oral or visual or machine readable form, or in the form of samples or models, it is designated proprietary or commercially sensitive at the time of disclosure and is confirmed by the Disclosing Party as such in documentary form within thirty (30) days from its being disclosed, in which event all the protections and restrictions in this Agreement as to the use and disclosure of said Proprietary information shall apply retrospectively during the said period of thirty days.\nProprietary Information shall also include any information which can be obtained by examination, testing or analysis of any hardware, software or material samples provided by the Disclosing Party, notwithstanding that the requirements for marking and designation referred to above shall not have been fulfilled.\n2. Subject to the provisions of Clauses 4 and 7 hereof, the Receiving Party undertakes:\n(a) to keep confidential and not disclose to any third party, except with the written permission of the Disclosing Party, any part, or the whole, of any Proprietary Information disclosed to it under this Agreement;\n(b) not to copy Proprietary Information disclosed to it under this Agreement except as is reasonably necessary for the Purpose;\n(c) not to use Proprietary Information disclosed to it under this Agreement other than for the Purpose, except with the prior written permission of the Disclosing Party;\n(d) to restrict access to the Proprietary Information disclosed to it under the terms of this Agreement to those of its employees and officers who need to know the same for the Purpose.\n3. The protections and restrictions in this Agreement as to the use and disclosure of Proprietary Information shall not apply to any information which the Receiving Party can show by written and dated or datable material:\n(a) is, at the time of disclosure hereunder, already published or otherwise publicly available; or\n(b) is, after disclosure hereunder, published or becomes available to the public other than by breach of this Agreement; or\n(c) is rightfully in the Receiving Party's possession with rights to use and/or disclose, prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; or\n(d) is rightfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party with rights to use and/or disclose; or\n(e) is independently developed by or for the Receiving Party without reference or access to Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder; or\n(f) is the subject of a requirement of a court proceeding requirement on the Receiving Party for disclosure, in which event the Receiving Party shall give prompt notice thereof to the Disclosing Party to the extent permissible by law..\n4. Neither Dstl nor The University shall be in breach of this Agreement where it can show that any disclosure of information is made solely and to the extent necessary to comply with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 or the Environmental Information Regulations 2004. Where Dstl or The University is required to make a disclosure of Proprietary Information of a Disclosing Party under the Act or the Regulations it shall, to the extent permitted by the time for compliance under the Act or the Regulations, give the Disclosing Party the opportunity to make representations concerning disclosure. The Disclosing Party, however, acknowledges and accepts that its representations may not be determinative and that the decision whether to disclose the Proprietary Information at issue, in order to comply with the Act or the Regulations, is a matter in which Dstl or The University shall exercise its own discretion, subject always to the provisions of the Act or the Regulations and based upon the principle to limit said disclosure to only the requested and required information under the Act or the Regulations. Dstl or The University shall in any event provide prior notification to the Disclosing Party of any decision to disclose any of its Proprietary Information.\n5. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as:\n(a) conferring upon the Receiving Party any right of use in or title to Proprietary Information received by it from the Disclosing Party, other than as expressly provided herein or as conferred in writing upon the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party subsequent to the date of this Agreement; or\n(b) constituting a warranty as to the accuracy of the Proprietary Information or the suitability thereof for any purpose whatsoever; or\n(c) diminishing the rights any Party has under Statute; or\n(d) implying that a further contractual arrangement will be concluded between the Parties; or\n(e) overriding or prejudicing any Government security classification or export control regulation applicable to any part of the Proprietary Information; or\n(f) requiring any Party to disclose to any other any particular Proprietary Information.\n6. All Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder, and any copies thereof made by a Receiving Party, shall be and remain the Disclosing Party's property and shall be delivered up promptly by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party on receipt of the Disclosing Party's written request therefor.\n7. This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of two (2) years following the date first above written after which it will terminate unless renewed by mutual consent in writing or to the extent that it is superseded by another agreement or contract between the Parties. The obligations and restrictions relating to the disclosure and use of Proprietary Information shall however survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of seven (7) years.\n8. This Agreement constitutes the entire existing Agreement between the Parties concerning the exchange of Proprietary Information for the Purpose. The Agreement shall not be amended except by written agreement signed by authorised representatives of all Parties.\n9. No Party shall, without the express consent in writing of the other Parties, assign or in any manner transfer its interests in, or obligations under, this Agreement or any part thereof.\n10. A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement. This clause does not affect any right or remedy of any person which exists or is available otherwise than pursuant to that Act.\n11. This Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of England and the Parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the English courts.\n12. The Parties shall attempt to solve any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement by means of alternative dispute resolution such as but without limitation mediation or mini-trial.\nUpon the occurrence of the dispute, the Parties shall define the type and the rules for the implementation of such alternative resolution.\nThe Parties expressly agree that after a period of two (2) months after the occurrence of the dispute and provided that the dispute remains unsolved, it shall be finally settled under the rules of Arbitration of the London Court of International Arbitration by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules. The place of arbitration shall be London (UK). The language of arbitration shall be the English Language.\nThe Parties hereby agree to exclude the right of appeal to the High Court under section 69 of the Arbitration Act 1996 and the right for an application to be made to the High Court under the corresponding section of the Act.\nEach Party recognises and acknowledges that in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement it shall have the right to apply for injunctive relief or other appropriate orders before any competent court to restrain the other as a remedy for any such breach.\nSigned for and on behalf of [THE COMPANY]\nBy: ..............................................

"      Commercial Confidential\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT, effective as of May 20th, 2015 between MARS Discovery District, MaRS Centre, South Tower, 101 College, Suite 100, Toronto, ON, M5G 1L7, Canada (hereinafter \""MaRS\"") and Recipients as indicated on the attached signature sheet (hereinafter \""Recipients\"" collectively or \u201cRecipient\u201d individually).\nWHEREAS, MaRS will be hosting a series of confidential presentations being made by entrants into a business pitch competition (the \u201cUp-Start Competition\u201d); and\nWHEREAS, entrants into the Up-Start Competition are each in possession of certain confidential information that will be disclosed during their presentation in the competition and through questions thereafter (hereinafter \""Confidential Information\""); and\nWHEREAS, Recipients desire to receive such Confidential Information for the purpose of participating in the Up-Start Competition either as competitors or as interested observers; and\nWHEREAS, MaRS wishes to ensure that the Confidential Information provided by competitors in the Up-Start Competition remains confidential.\nNOW, THEREFORE, Recipients agree as follows:\n1. Recipients (and their respective partners, suppliers, licensors, licencees, agents, contractors and affiliates, who are hereby authorized to have Confidential Information disclosed to them hereunder only so long as they are in receipt of said Confidential Information under terms of confidentiality comparable to those set forth herein) hereby agree to hold in confidence any and all Confidential Information disclosed during the Up-Start Competition, either verbally or in writing. Such obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to Confidential Information:\n(a) which, at the time of disclosure, is in the public domain or thereafter becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, other than by breach of this Agreement by the Recipient;\n(b) which was in the Recipient's possession at the time of disclosure and was not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing party;\n(c) which the Recipient receives from a third party having a lawful right to disclose the same;\n(d) in respect of which it can be established, by competent contemporaneous written evidence, that the same was developed by the Recipient independently of such disclosure; or\n(e) which is required to be disclosed to a third party pursuant to any applicable law or decision of any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, provided that (i) prior written notice, in light of the circumstances of such disclosure, is provided by the party required to make the disclosure to the third party to other party hereto; (ii) the party required to make the disclosure to the third party shall not disclose or release more Confidential Information than is required by law; and (iii) the party required to make disclosure to the third party cooperates with the other party hereto in any attempts it may make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to the Confidential Information.\n2. Recipient agrees not to use the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder for any commercial or other purpose other than the purpose described in the third recital to this Agreement, without first entering into a written agreement between the parties covering such other use. Upon receiving a written request from the disclosing party, the receiving party shall cease to use the Confidential Information disclosed to it and shall promptly thereafter return to the disclosing party all written or otherwise documented Confidential Information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement, except that one copy of all such Confidential Information may be kept for archival purposes and for the purpose of defending against any lawsuits brought by the disclosing party against the Recipient.\n3. Recipient acknowledges that any violation of any of the provisions hereof by such party may result in immediate and irreparable damage to other party and agrees that in the event of such violation the other party shall, in addition to any other right, relief or remedy at law, be entitled to any equitable relief that any court of competent jurisdiction may deem just and proper.\n4. Recipient agrees to use due care, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care, to keep Confidential Information disclosed to it pursuant to this Agreement in a safe and secure place that is at least as safe and secure as the place where that party keeps other confidential information that it considers to be valuable and proprietary to itself.\n5. Nothing herein constitutes a license or other transfer of rights in respect of either party's interest in any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.\n6. The obligations arising pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, the parties' confidentiality obligations, shall expire on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date first above written, unless such obligations are modified by a subsequent written agreement between the parties.\n7. This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns.\n8. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and may not be changed, modified, amended or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by the parties. The unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.\n9. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives.\nAttendees\nName Email\n"",","commercial,

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT (the \""Agreement\u201d) is entered into on this day of by and between NPAF.CA (www.npaf.ca), located at St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, Canada ( the\u201d Disclosing Party\u201d), and with and address at (the \u201cRecipient\u201d or the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\nThe Recipient hereto desires to participate in discussions regarding (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). During these discussions, Disclosing Party may share certain proprietary information with the Recipient. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information.\n(a) For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any data or information that is proprietary to the Disclosing Party and not generally known to the public, whether in tangible or intangible form, whenever and however disclosed, including, but not limited to: (i) any marketing strategies, plans, financial information, or projections, operations, sales estimates, business plans and performance results relating to the past, present or future business activities of such party, its affiliates, subsidiaries and affiliated companies; (ii) plans for products or services, and customer or supplier lists; (iii) any scientific or technical information, invention, design, process, procedure, formula, improvement, technology or method; (iv) any concepts, reports, data, know-how, works-in-progress, designs, development tools, specifications, computer software, source code, object code, flow charts, databases, inventions, information and trade secrets; and (v) any other information that should reasonably be recognized as confidential information of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information need not be novel, unique, patentable, copyrightable or constitute a trade secret in order to be designated Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is proprietary to the Disclosing Party, has been developed and obtained through great efforts by the Disclosing Party and that Disclosing Party regards all of its Confidential Information as trade secrets\n(b) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) was known by the Receiving Party prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes rightfully known to the Receiving Party from a third-party source not known (after diligent inquiry) by the Receiving Party to be under an obligation to Disclosing Party to maintain confidentiality; (c) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of or failure to act by the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement; (d) is required to be disclosed in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or is otherwise requested or required to be disclosed by law or regulation, although the requirements of paragraph 4 hereof shall apply prior to any disclosure being made; and (e) is or has been independently developed by employees, consultants or agents of the Receiving Party without violation of the terms of this Agreement or reference or access to any Confidential Information.\n2. Disclosure of Confidential Information.\nFrom time to time, the Disclosing Party may disclose Confidential Information to the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party will: (a) limit disclosure of any Confidential Information to its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives (collectively \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who have a need to know such Confidential Information in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties to which this Agreement relates, and only for that purpose; (b) advise its Representatives of the proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and of the obligations set forth in this Agreement and require such Representatives to keep the Confidential Information confidential; (c) shall keep all Confidential Information strictly confidential by using a reasonable degree of care, but not less than the degree of care used by it in safeguarding its own confidential information; and (d) not disclose any Confidential Information received by it to any third parties (except as otherwise provided for herein).\nEach party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of their respective Representatives.\n3. Use of Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information solely in connection with the current or contemplated business relationship between the parties and not for any purpose other than as authorized by this Agreement without the prior written consent of an authorized representative of the Disclosing Party. No other right or license, whether expressed or implied, in the Confidential Information is granted to the Receiving Party hereunder. Title to the Confidential Information will remain solely in the Disclosing Party. All use of Confidential Information by the Receiving Party shall be for the benefit of the Disclosing Party and any modifications and improvements thereof by the Receiving Party shall be the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing contained herein is intended to modify the parties' existing agreement that their discussions in furtherance of a potential business relationship are governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 408.\n4. Compelled Disclosure of Confidential Information.\nNotwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any governmental, judicial, or administrative order, subpoena, discovery request, regulatory request or similar method, provided that the Receiving Party promptly notifies, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party in writing of such demand for disclosure so that the Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek to make such disclosure subject to a protective order or other appropriate remedy to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information; provided in the case of a broad regulatory request with respect to the Receiving Party\u2019s business (not targeted at Disclosing Party), the Receiving Party may promptly comply with such request provided the Receiving Party give (if permitted by such regulator) the Disclosing Party prompt notice of such disclosure. The Receiving Party agrees that it shall not oppose and shall cooperate with efforts by, to the extent practicable, the Disclosing Party with respect to any such request for a protective order or other relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain or does not seek a protective order and the Receiving Party is legally requested or required to disclose such Confidential Information, disclosure of such Confidential Information may be made without liability.\n5. Term.\nThis Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to a one year extension if the parties are still discussing and considering the Transaction at the end of the second year). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties\u2019 duty to hold in confidence Confidential Information that was disclosed during term shall remain in effect indefinitely.\n6. Remedies.\nBoth parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information to be disclosed hereunder is of a unique and valuable character, and that the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential\nInformation would destroy or diminish the value of such information. The damages to Disclosing Party that would result from the unauthorized dissemination of the Confidential Information would be impossible to calculate. Therefore, both parties hereby agree that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief preventing the dissemination of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof. Such injunctive relief shall be in addition to any other remedies available hereunder, whether at law or in equity. Disclosing Party shall be entitled to recover its costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred in obtaining any such relief. Further, in the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.\n7. Return of Confidential Information.\nReceiving Party shall immediately return and redeliver to the other all tangible material embodying the Confidential Information provided hereunder and all notes, summaries, memoranda, drawings, manuals, records, excerpts or derivative information deriving there from and all other documents or materials (\u201cNotes\u201d) (and all copies of any of the foregoing, including \u201ccopies\u201d that have been converted to computerized media in the form of image, data or word processing files either manually or by image capture) based on or including any Confidential Information, in whatever form of storage or retrieval, upon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the dealings between the parties contemplated hereunder; (ii) the termination of this Agreement; or (iii) at such time as the Disclosing Party may so request; provided however that the Receiving Party may retain such of its documents as is necessary to enable it to comply with its document retention policies. Alternatively, the Receiving Party, with the written consent of the Disclosing Party may (or in the case of Notes, at the Receiving Party\u2019s option) immediately destroy any of the foregoing embodying Confidential Information (or the reasonably nonrecoverable data erasure of computerized data) and, upon request, certify in writing such destruction by an authorized officer of the Receiving Party supervising the destruction).\n8. Notice of Breach.\nReceiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information by Receiving Party or its Representatives, or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party or its Representatives, and will cooperate with efforts by the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.\n9. No Binding Agreement for Transaction.\nThe parties agree that neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement, except for the matters specifically agreed to herein. The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time. This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between the parties. If a Transaction goes forward, the non-disclosure provisions of any applicable transaction documents entered into between the parties (or their respective affiliates) for the Transaction shall supersede this Agreement. In the event such provision is not provided for in said transaction documents, this Agreement shall control.\n10. Warranty.\nEach party warrants that it has the right to make the disclosures under this Agreement. NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER. The parties acknowledge that although they shall each endeavor to include in the Confidential Information all information that they each believe relevant for the purpose of the evaluation of a Transaction, the parties understand that no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information is being made by either party as the Disclosing Party. Further, neither party is under any obligation under this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information it chooses not to disclose. Neither Party hereto shall have any liability to the other party or to the other party\u2019s Representatives resulting from any use of the Confidential Information except with respect to disclosure of such Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.\n11. Miscellaneous.\n(a) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can only be modified by a written amendment signed by the party against whom enforcement of such modification is sought.\n(b) The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Newfoundland, Canada applicable to contracts made and to be wholly performed within such state, without giving effect to any conflict of laws provisions thereof. The Federal and state courts located in Newfoundland, Canada, shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under the terms of this Agreement.\n(c) Any failure by either party to enforce the other party\u2019s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n(d) Although the restrictions contained in this Agreement are considered by the parties to be reasonable for the purpose of protecting the Confidential Information, if any such restriction is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified, rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision was not included.\n(e) Any notices or communications required or permitted to be given hereunder may be delivered by hand, deposited with a nationally recognized overnight carrier, electronic-mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, in each case, to the address of the other party first indicated above (or such other addressee as may be furnished by a party in accordance with this paragraph). All such notices or communications shall be deemed to have been given and received (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by a nationally recognized overnight carrier, on the third business day following dispatch and (c) in the case of mailing, on the seventh business day following such mailing.\n(f) This Agreement is personal in nature, and neither party may directly or indirectly assign or transfer it by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. All obligations contained in this Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors, assigns and design\n(g) The receipt of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will not prevent or in any way limit either party from: (i) developing, making or marketing products or services that are or may be competitive with the products or services of the other; or (ii) providing products or services to others who compete with the other.\n(h) Paragraph headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not be used or relied upon in the interpretation of this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.\nDisclosing Party Receiving Party\nBy
