CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS.\na. Recipient shall hold Confidential Information in confidence and use, reproduce and disclose the Confidential Information only to the extent reasonably required to facilitate a business relationship between the parties (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\nb. Recipient shall protect the Confidential Information using the same degree of care that Recipient uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature to prevent the unauthorized use, reproduction or disclosure of the Confidential Information. Such care shall not be less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any employees, contractors, or third parties except to those employees, contractors or third parties who have a need to know the Confidential Information to fulfill the Purpose, provided that: (i) Recipient shall be vicariously\nliable for any act or omission of such employees, contractors or third parties respecting the Confidential Information, (ii) such employee, contractor or third party has been advised of the confidentiality obligations contained in this NDA and has either agreed in writing to be bound by the obligations of this NDA, or has entered into a binding written obligation of confidentiality with the Recipient that affords substantially similar protection of the Confidential Information.\nc.

For greater certainty, failure of the Discloser to make such request of Recipient shall not entitle Recipient to make any further use of the Confidential Information or otherwise extend Recipient\u2019s rights set forth herein after expiration or termination of this NDA and Recipient specifically agrees to cease any further use of Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information in such event.\n6. NO RESTRICTIONS ON GENERAL KNOWLEDGE.

For purposes of this Agreement, company confidential and/or proprietary information, hereinafter called Proprietary Information, shall be construed to mean any information, whether disclosed in writing, orally or otherwise, that the disclosing party considers to be material to its business operations (and for CAE, as applicable, the business operations of its direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliated companies/entities (the \u201cCAE Group\u201d), including, without limitation, any commercial, financial, technical, and/or marketing information, business and/or strategic plans, wage and salary information, trade secrets, data, concepts, computer programs, software, designs, product specifications, drawings, processes, know-how, inventions and ideas, and any information relating to its customers, suppliers, employees or contractors. Where practical, the disclosing party may have the Proprietary Information identified as \u201cProprietary\u201d or \u201cConfidential\u201d with an appropriate legend, marking, stamp or other obvious written identification.\n2. The party receiving any Proprietary Information:\na) shall not use or duplicate said Proprietary Information, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than the Purpose, without the prior written consent of the disclosing party;\nb) shall protect and keep in confidence said Proprietary Information by using the same degree of care and safeguard as it uses to protect its own Proprietary Information of like importance, but in any event no less than a reasonable degree of care;\nc) shall not disclose or permit that said Proprietary Information be disclosed, in any manner whatsoever, other than to its directors, officers, employees, investment advisers, legal counsel or other agents (and for CAE, as applicable, a member of the CAE Group) who have a need to know, and this, only if it is strictly necessary to disclose said Proprietary Information to these persons for the Purpose. The receiving party undertakes to advise such persons of the confidential nature of this information and shall ensure that such persons are bound by confidentiality undertakings;\nd) shall not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any product (hardware or software) received from the other party;\ne) shall not remove, overprint or deface notices of copyright or ownership, trademark logo or legend, if any, from any information or material obtained from the other party.\n3. Except as set out above, the receiving party shall not disclose to any person the fact that discussions are taking place between the parties concerning the Purpose, including the status of such discussions.\n4. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring, expressly or impliedly, any rights in or title to the Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder. It is agreed that no license and more particularly no licence under any patents or copyrights of any party is granted by this Agreement or by any disclosure of Proprietary Information hereunder.\n5. The parties shall not be liable for disclosure or use of Proprietary Information which:\na) was at the time of receipt otherwise known to the party receiving it without any breach of an obligation of confidentiality;\nb) was published or is otherwise within the public knowledge or is generally known to the public at the time of its disclosure to the receiving party, or becomes part of the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the recipient;\nc) is developed independently by the recipient or parent, subsidiary or associated companies of the recipient without recourse to the Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder;\nd) becomes legally known or available to the receiving party from a source other than the disclosing party, and without breach of this Agreement by the recipient;\ne) becomes available to the receiving party by inspection or analysis of products available in the market other than the products of either party;\nf) is so disclosed or used with the written approval of the other party;\ng) if, and then to the extent that disclosure is required by law to be given to a governmental body or a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the recipient provides to the disclosing party prompt notice of any such requirement to disclose the Proprietary Information, to permit the disclosing party to seek an appropriate remedy to prevent the disclosure or alternatively to agree to the terms of such disclosure.\n6. No party shall be liable for the inadvertent or accidental disclosure of Proprietary Information if such disclosure occurs despite the exercise of the same degree of care as such party normally takes to preserve and safeguard its own Proprietary Information, but in any event no less than a reasonable degree of care.\n7. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies the disclosing party may have, each party acknowledges and agrees that damages would not be an adequate remedy for a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement; therefore the disclosing party shall be entitled to seek injunctive (final, interlocutory and provisional or preliminary), specific performance and other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the provisions of this Agreement before any court of competent jurisdiction.\n8. This Agreement shall, unless earlier terminated as indicated hereafter, be for a term of one (1) year from the date first above mentioned, and be renewed automatically for one year periods, unless a party sends in writing to the other a notice of non-renewal, thirty days prior to the expiration of a term. The disclosing party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement should the recipient fail to comply with any of the provisions of the Agreement.\n9. Notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement, as they relate to the safeguard, disclosure or use of Proprietary Information shall, unless agreed otherwise by the Parties, or unless such information becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the receiving party, remain in full force and effect a) for a period of five (5) years from expiration or termination of this Agreement when the disclosing party is a potential supplier to CAE, or b), for a period of twenty five years if the disclosing party is CAE. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party agrees to promptly return or destroy, as instructed by the disclosing party, any Proprietary Information received from the disclosing party, together with all copies thereof, upon request by the disclosing party, termination of the Agreement or expiry or termination of the Purpose, whichever is earlier.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, one (1) copy may be retained in confidential restricted access files of the recipient\u2019s legal department for use by its legal counsel strictly in the event of a dispute.\n10. Each party shall bear its own costs incurred under or in connection with this Agreement.\n11. Nothing in this Agreement shall grant to a party the right to make any commitments of any kind for, or on behalf of, the other party without the prior written consent of such party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an obligation by a party to enter into a contract, subcontract or other business relationship with the other party.\n12. If any provision of this Agreement becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable regulation or law, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired.\n13. Any failure by a party to exercise any rights, power or privilege under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise of any right, power or privilege.\n14. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be transferred or assigned by a party without the prior written approval of the other party.\n15. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreements and undertakings between the parties with respect to Proprietary Information supplied to each other, and is the complete agreement of the parties in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement.\n16. This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Quebec excluding its conflict of law rules and any applicable Federal laws of Canada.\n17. This Agreement may be signed in several counterparts, each of such counterparts so signed shall constitute an original, and all counterparts together shall constitute a single instrument.

"      MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into and made effective as of the later of the two signature dates below by and between (NAME OF COMPANY) (\u201cXYZ\u201d (ADDRESS OF COMPANY), and Tennessee Technological University, with its principal office at One William L. Jones Dr., Derryberry Hall 305, Cookeville, TN 38505 (\u201cTTU\u201d). WHEREAS, in connection with certain business discussions between XYZ and TTU, XYZ and TTU may disclose and reveal to each other, either orally, in writing or otherwise, certain materials, trade secrets, proprietary information and other confidential information relating directly or indirectly to their respective products and businesses.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the disclosure of Confidential Information (as defined below) by each party, the covenants contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of all of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:\n1. Disclosure of Confidential Information.\n(a) For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any and all information (including, without limitation, all business, financial, commercial and technical information and data), in whatever form transmitted, whether tangible or intangible, that is disclosed, furnished or otherwise provided or made available by the disclosing party to the receiving party prior to or after the date of this Agreement. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes, without limitation, design documents, trade secrets, files, marketing and business plans, documentation, reports, projections, interpretations, forecasts, records (including information regarding the disclosing party\u2019s businesses, customers, strategies, operations, finances, technology, data, processes, methodologies, know-how, existing or future products, services, applications and methods of operation (including how such methods are developed, conducted or operated)) and all other information, whether in written, oral, encoded, electronic or other tangible or intangible form, and whether or not labeled, marked or otherwise identified as \u201cConfidential\u201d upon disclosure thereof, relating to the disclosing party\u2019s products and businesses, and any other information that would, if disclosed to any actual or potential competitors of the disclosing party, give or increase those competitors\u2019 advantage over the disclosing party or directly or indirectly harm the disclosing party\u2019s business.\n(b) Any trade secrets will be entitled to all of the protections and benefits of applicable trade secret laws and any other applicable laws. For avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction determines that information the disclosing party deems to be a trade secret is not a trade secret under applicable law, such information will nevertheless be deemed to be Confidential Information for purposes hereof, provided such information falls within the description set forth in Section 1(a).\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not mean information that, as demonstrated by the receiving party, is (i) in the public domain prior to the date of this Agreement through no wrongful act of the receiving party or its agents or employees, (ii) independently developed by the receiving party without any use of, or reference to, Confidential Information, (iii) rightfully furnished to the receiving party by any third party without violation or breach of any confidentiality restriction, or (iv) authorized in writing for release by the disclosing party.\n2. Obligations Regarding Confidential Information.\n(a) Subject to the Tennessee Public Records Act, Section 10-7-5-1 et seq., at all times during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the receiving party shall:\n(i) refrain from disclosing, directly or indirectly, any Confidential Information of the disclosing party to third parties, and hold all Confidential Information received from the disclosing party in trust and strict confidence, subject to the terms of this Agreement;\n(ii) take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care, to keep confidential the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information and avoid disclosure, loss or misuse of the Confidential Information; and\n(iii) refrain from using any of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information for any purpose not specified hereunder (including, without limitation, in its own business or for its own benefit) without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.\n(b) Subject to the Tennessee Public Records Act, Section 10-7-5-1 et seq.,without the written consent of the disclosing party, the receiving party will not disclose the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information to any person other than the receiving party\u2019s officers, directors, owners, employees, agents and representatives (i) with a valid need to know such Confidential Information and (ii) that have an enforceable agreement with the receiving party containing confidentiality obligations substantially similar to those terms and conditions applicable to the receiving party under this Agreement.\n(c) In the event that the receiving party is legally required to disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party, the receiving party shall give the disclosing party prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the disclosing party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and the receiving party will reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party (at the disclosing party\u2019s expense) to obtain such protective order. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the disclosing party waives compliance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.\n(d) The receiving party shall give prompt written notice to the disclosing party upon discovery of any loss, misuse, misappropriation or disclosure of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information, and will reasonably cooperate with the disclosing party to help regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure.\n(e) Upon the disclosing party\u2019s request, all documents, materials and other items containing the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information (including without limitation, all originals, copies, and reproductions of the Confidential Information) shall be promptly returned to the disclosing party without retaining a copy thereof, and the receiving party shall provide a certification, signed by an officer, as to the completeness of the return of such materials. Upon such request, the receiving party also shall destroy all documents, materials and other items embodying or summarizing the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information in whatever format, and shall provide a similar certification as to the completeness of the destruction of such materials. Compliance with this Subsection 2(e) shall not relieve the receiving party of its obligations under this Agreement.\n3. Ownership. The disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing party. No license under any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property or proprietary right is granted or implied to any information furnished by or on behalf of either party to the other party, whether or not Confidential Information. Each party acknowledges that the other party\u2019s Confidential Information is highly valuable, confidential and proprietary to the other party and has been developed through the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that maintaining the confidentiality of this Confidential Information is essential for the general successful operations of TTU and Company.\n4. Miscellaneous.\n(a) Neither the holding of discussions nor the exchange of material or Confidential Information shall be construed as (i) obligating a party to enter into any agreement with the other party hereto; (ii) a commitment or obligation by a party to develop, sell or contract with respect to any products or services offered by the other party; or (iii) a license, partnership or joint venture between the parties.\n(b) The parties acknowledge and agree that all Confidential Information is provided \u201cAS-IS\u201d and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding such Confidential Information\u2019s accuracy or completeness. Each party understands and agrees that neither party shall have any liability whatsoever to the other party relating to or resulting from such party\u2019s use of the Confidential Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom.\n(c) This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee as executed and performed in that state without regard to conflicts of laws principles. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that a party may assign this Agreement without consent in the event of a sale of securities or assets, merger or change of control of such party. Any assignment in violation of this Subsection 4(d) shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against the successors and permitted assigns of each party to this Agreement.\n(d) Failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver thereof. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the extent permissible and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between the parties concerning the Confidential Information, and no modifications of this Agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof will be binding upon either party unless approved in writing by each party. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in \u201cportable document format\u201d (\u201c.pdf\u201d) form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.\n(e) This Agreement shall be deemed to have been drafted by each party hereto. This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of the drafting or preparation, and the parties expressly agree not to assert that any inference should be drawn against either party on the basis of which party drafted this Agreement.\n(g) Either party may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party.

Each party may be provided with access to selected information (oral, written, or electronic) of the other which helps meet a regulatory purpose or business need, including, but not limited to, that information which relates or refers to: business planning; internal controls; computer, data processing, or communications architectures or systems; electronic data processing architectures, applications, programs, routines, or subroutines; business affairs and methods of operation or proposed methods of operations, techniques or systems of a party or any customer of a party, financial or other non-public information, including but not limited to proposals, processes, forecasts, ideas, concepts, projections, analyses, software, hardware, marketing information, documentation, structure and protocols. Some of the information in each of these categories is confidential in nature or constitutes a trade secret as it is not generally known to its competitors or the public. This information received from a party, either orally or in writing, during the course of the Project shall be deemed to be confidential information (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) for purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement. Notes, documents, summaries or reports which are prepared from Confidential Information to the extent such specifically refer or relate to Confidential Information are themselves Confidential Information.\n2. Each party acknowledges the sensitive and secret nature of the Confidential Information it will have access to during the term of the Project and agrees that it will treat such Confidential Information as strictly confidential and shall exercise the same degree of care in the protection of the Confidential Information as the receiving party exercises with respect to its own proprietary property and trade secrets, but in no event shall it be less than a reasonable degree of care given the nature of the Confidential Information.\n3. Neither party shall disclose the Confidential Information received from the other to any person or entity, except its employees, officers, directors, independent consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and other agents (collectively \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) involved in the performance of the Project, or to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations under the Project. Each party acknowledges and agrees that breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by the other and/or anyone employed by or otherwise associated with the other may also constitute a violation of applicable laws. Access to Confidential Information by the receiving party shall be limited to those Representatives who have agreed to be bound in writing under terms no less stringent than this Confidentiality Agreement.\n4. Neither party shall make copies of the Confidential Information except for those copies required for use by Authorized Persons in the performance of the Project. Each copy, including its storage media, shall be marked Confidential, and also include all copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices which appear on the original. Each party agrees that all Confidential Information of the other party, including any copies thereof, shall be returned to the disclosing party upon request or destroyed within ten (10) business days of the expiration or other termination of the Project. However, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, 1) neither party will be required to delete electronic Confidential Information stored in back-up/archival storage in accordance with its policies, provided that any such retained Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement until it is destroyed by the receiving party; and 2) a single copy of all Confidential Information may be retained by the Receiving Party\u2019s legal department for dispute resolution purposes only, provided, however, that such Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality Agreement. In the event that a receiving party has or acquires actual knowledge of any breach of the confidentiality of, or the misappropriation of, any Confidential Information received under this Confidentiality Agreement, such party shall promptly give notice thereof to the other party.\n5.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, 1) neither party will be required to delete electronic Confidential Information stored in back-up/archival storage in accordance with its policies, provided that any such retained Confidential Information will continue to be subject to the terms of this Confidentiality Agreement until it is destroyed by the receiving party; and 2) a single copy of all Confidential Information may be retained by the Receiving Party\u2019s legal department for dispute resolution purposes only, provided, however, that such Confidential Information shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Confidentiality Agreement.\n6. All intellectual property rights associated with the Confidential Information, including without limitation, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret rights, and moral rights shall remain in the disclosing party. Moreover, this Confidentiality Agreement does not grant any right or license to a party, by implication or otherwise, to any intellectual property owned or controlled by the other party.\n7. The obligation of non-disclosure shall not extend to: (1) information which is then already in the possession of the receiving party and not under a duty of non-disclosure; (2) information which is generally known or revealed to the public; (3) information which is revealed to the receiving party by a third party, unless such party is under a duty of non-disclosure; (4) information which the receiving party develops independently of the disclosure and such independent development can be shown by documentary evidence maintained contemporaneously with such development; or (5) information that is disclosed with the disclosing party\u2019s prior written consent.\n8.

Moreover, any such award of relief to the discloser of such Confidential Information shall include recovery of all actual and reasonable costs associated with enforcement of this Agreement including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 fees.\n10. The Effective Date of this Confidentiality Agreement shall be the date it is signed by both parties and it shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days written notice of either party, or (ii) three (3) years after the effective date.\n11. The representations and obligations of each party relative to the Confidential Information shall survive the expiration or termination of this Confidentiality Agreement for a period of the longer of three (3) years or for such time as such Confidential Information remains a protectable trade secret under applicable law.\n12. The rights and obligations of the parties hereunder are in addition to, and not in derogation of, their respective rights and duties under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\u201cUTSA\u201d) as adopted in the state set forth below or in respective state\u2019s trade secrets laws, if UTSA has not been adopted.\n13. This Confidentiality Agreement contains the full and complete understanding of Company and <Vendor Name Here> with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior representations and understandings whether they be oral or written.\n14. Company and <Vendor Name Here> understand and agree that in the event any part, term or provision of this Confidentiality Agreement is held to be invalid or legally unenforceable, the validity of the remaining parts, terms or provisions shall not be affected, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Confidentiality Agreement did not contain the particular part, term, or provision held to be invalid. This Confidentiality Agreement and performance thereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflicts of laws rules.\n15. The parties acknowledge that the Confidential Information disclosed by each of them under this Confidentiality Agreement may be subject to export controls under the laws of the United States. Each party shall comply with such laws and agrees not to knowingly export, re-export or transfer Confidential Information of the other party without first obtaining all required United States authorizations or licenses.\n16. Neither party may assign this Confidentiality Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may assign or transfer this Confidentiality Agreement and its rights hereunder to an affiliate or successor to its assets or liabilities if such assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof and the non-assignment party is given notice of such an assignment. Any assignment to the contrary shall be void.\n17. The persons executing this Confidentiality Agreement warrant that they have the authority to bind <Vendor Name Here> and Company to the terms and conditions embodied in this Confidentiality Agreement.\n18. Neither party makes or intends to make any warranty or representation of any kind concerning the Confidential Information, except each party represents and warrants that it has the right to disclose Confidential Information to Receiving Party. Confidential Information is provided only for discussion purposes, is provided on an \u201cAs Is\u201d basis, and Receiving Party relies on Confidential Information at its own risk.\n19.

The Disclosing Party understands and acknowledges that the Receiving Party and/or its Representatives may currently or in the future be developing information, knowledge or technology internally, or obtaining information, knowledge or technology from other persons that may be similar to information, knowledge or technology contained or reflected in the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n21.

Equitable Remedy. The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) the covenants in this Agreement are reasonable under the circumstances and are necessary to protect the Parties and the property of such Parties; and (ii) the breach by one Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement would cause serious and irreparable harm to the other Party that could not be adequately remedied by monetary damages alone.

No Representation. Each Party understands and acknowledges that no representation or warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, is made as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information provided by either Party, and neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its affiliates, Representatives, directors, officers, equity owners, managers, employees or agents shall have any liability to the Recipient or to any other person or entity resulting from use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.\n12. No Commitment. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as committing the Parties hereto to enter into any business relationship between the Parties.\n13. Entire Agreement.

Modification. Except as permitted in Section 21 below (unilaterally changing its address), this Agreement may be modified, amended, superseded, or cancelled only by a written instrument signed by each of the Parties hereto, and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party to be bound by any such waiver.\n15. Severability.

Governing Law/Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho, determined without regard to conflicts of law principles. Each Party expressly submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court in Coeur D\u2019Alene, Idaho, or alternatively, to the jurisdiction of the First Judicial District Court of Kootenai County, Idaho.\n17.

The terms of this Agreement are the result of mutual negotiations between the parties, and the provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with their fair meanings, and not strictly for or against either party, regardless of which Party may have drafted this Agreement.\n18. Waiver. Any failure at any time of either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such provision or prejudice the right of such Party to enforce such provision at any subsequent time.\n19. Attorneys' Fees and Costs. In the event of any dispute with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover, in addition to any other damages assessed, its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in litigating, arbitrating, or otherwise settling or resolving such dispute.\n20.

Confidential Information shall not include: (a) information which can be shown to have been in the public domain at the time of disclosure, (b) documented information which was possessed prior to the time of its disclosure hereunder, (c) information that becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise not due to any unauthorized act or omission on the part of the parties or party, or (d) information that is given to the parties without obligation of secrecy by a third party, who is free to disclose the information, as of the date of such third party's disclosure.\n2. Use of Confidential Information. The parties acknowledge that any use of shared Confidential Information other than for the benefit of Client or the furtherance of a business relationship with Client, would be wrongful and cause irreparable harm to Client. Accordingly, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Client, Chemsultants agrees to (a) keep all Confidential Information confidential and to not, at any time during or after any transaction where Confidential Information disclosures are made, publish, disclose, or divulge Confidential Information to any person, firm, or corporation other than its Representatives and to cause its Representatives to observe the terms of this Agreement; (b) not use, directly or indirectly, copy, or reproduce any Confidential Information of Client for its own benefit or for the benefit of any person, firm, or corporation other than Client, and in any event only in connection with evaluating or engaging in a transaction or business relationship with Client.

Any Confidential Information disclosed to Chemsultants shall remain the sole property of Client, and no granting of any rights or licenses shall be created as a result of the disclosure.\n5. Return of Documents. Upon written request by Client at any time, Chemsultants shall promptly return all Confidential Information, including all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon in the party\u2019s possession or in the possession of any Representative of the party, provided, however, Chemsultants shall be permitted to charge Client for all reasonable costs incurred by Chemsultants for compliance with this Section.\n6. Remedies. It is agreed that money damages would be an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive relief, specific performance, and/or any other appropriate equitable remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedies shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n7. Waiver and Severability. It is understood that no failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall constitute waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n8. Non-disclosure Agreement Only. This Agreement shall not constitute, create, give effect to, or otherwise imply a joint venture, pooling agreement, partnership, or formal business organization of any kind. The exchange of Confidential Information does not constitute a business offer, an acceptance, or promise for any future contract or amendment to any existing contract between the parties. Each party represents that the individual signing below has been given, and does have, the requisite authority to legally bind the party represented by that individual.\n9. Modification. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning the confidentiality of the Confidential Information and cannot be modified, released, discharged, abandoned, or otherwise terminated in whole or in part unless approved in writing. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party, and any attempt to do so shall be void, provided, however, that either party shall be permitted to assign this agreement to any purchaser of all or substantially all of such party\u2019s assets or equity interests, without consent, provided such purchaser agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions contained herein.\n10. Miscellaneous.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nBOOSTER Precision Components GmbH\nW\u00f6hlerstra\u00dfe 8-10\n60323 Frankfurt am Main\nGermany\nPlace, Date, Signature, Stamp\nRECITALS:\nBoth Contract Partners intend to exchange information, documents (including expert opinions, notes, correspondence, evaluations, and conclusions), data and/or knowledge \u2013 regardless whether these be transmitted verbally, in writing or electronically \u2013 as well as prototypes and prototype components which may have already been manufactured (hereinafter commonly referred to as \u201cInformation\u201d) which the disclosing party (\u201cDiscloser\u201d) concerned considers to be worthy of being protected and treated confidentially. The exchange of information serves to evaluate the possibility of a supply relationship between the Contract Partners (\u201cPurpose of Exchange\u201d). In order to enable the non-disclosure and the exchange of information the Contract Partners agree as follows:\nThe Contract Partners undertake to keep the Information in accordance with the detailed provisions of this contract as disclosed by the other Contract Partner secure and take the necessary precautions to ensure that third parties have no access to the Information and that the Information is not disclosed to third parties.\n1. The Contract Partner receiving the Information (\u201eRecipient \u201c) will not disclose the Information received to third parties or use the Information for own business purposes for any other purpose except the Purpose of Exchange, without first obtaining the written agreement of the Discloser. This applies explicitly also to the use of Information for the purpose of registering patents, brands, and other intellectual property. The Recipient will ensure that the Information is only disclosed to those employees who need to know the same for the Purpose of Exchange and who explicitly know they owe a duty of confidence to the Discloser and who are bound by obligations equivalent to those in clauses 1 and 2. The Discloser may request from the Recipient a non-disclosure obligation of the employee at any time.\n2. The aforementioned non-disclosure obligation and restriction of use laid down herein does not extend to such information which is state of the art in the public domain and to which the Recipient has access without breach of law, and also not to such information to which the Recipient already had access without breach of law before the Information was disclosed to him by the Discloser, and finally not to such information which the Recipient was eligible to obtain from a third party. The Recipient bears the burden of proof. Nothing in this non-disclosure agreement will prevent the Recipient from making any disclosure of the Information required by law or by any competent authority. In such case the Recipient undertakes to inform the Discloser without delay of his obligation to disclose, will cooperate upon request of the Discloser and at own expenses on the defense against the obligation to disclose and will fulfil this obligation only to such extent as required by law.\n3. Upon request of the Discloser the Recipient will return all Information including all copies and records or delete electronically stored data \u2013 also in the framework of a back-up, provided this does not involve disproportionate expenditure, whereby the Discloser shall be provided proof of the deletion.\n4. There is mutual consent that this agreement cannot be interpreted in such a way that the Contract Partners grant each other a license for imparted know-how, inventions, and patents, or undertake to grant each other a license, grant other rights to intellectual property in connection with the Information. This agreement does not bind the Contract Partners in any service-, works-, broker-, joint venture- or company agreement.\n5. This Discloser shall not be liable for damage of any kind arising from the transfer or use of the Information; in particular, the Discloser is not responsible for the Information injuring the rights of third parties. The Discloser is not responsible for the completeness, correctness, or usability of the Information.\n6. An assignment of the rights arising from this agreement is not permitted. There is mutual agreement, however, that the rights granted in this agreement are due to the customer of the Discloser within the framework of an agreement in favor of a third party.\n7. This agreement is not a preliminary agreement and does not oblige either of the Contract Partners to enter into further contract negotiations or conclude a further-reaching contract. This agreement does not justify any further pre-contractual obligations.\n8. The Contract Partners agree that there is no adequate legal protection against any injury arising from this agreement due to the special nature of the Information to be kept secret. Any injury to the non-disclosure obligation would lead to irreparable damage to the Discloser. The Recipient therefore undertakes to inform the Discloser without delay as soon as has gained such knowledge himself of any unpermitted disclosure or unpermitted use as laid down in this agreement of any Information.\n9. This agreement comes into effect upon signing by both Contract Partners and applies to Information which has already been exchanged within the framework of the Purpose of Exchange. The agreement shall be valid for a fixed period of five years after the end of an individual Project or from the date of last disclosure. The non-disclosure obligation shall continue to apply upon termination of the agreement for the Information exchanged within the agreement.\n10. Each Contract Partner alone bears any costs arising in conjunction with this agreement and the Information.\n11. Amendments or modifications to this agreement require the written form. This also applies to an amendment or modification of this requirement of the written form.\n12. German law is applicable to this agreement. The court of jurisdiction for any disputes arising from or in the broadest sense in connection with this agreement as far as this is legally permissible. The Discloser has the right to take legal actions arising directly or indirectly out of this Non-discloser agreement against Contract Partner a court with jurisdiction at Discloser\u2019s discretion.\n13. Should any individual provisions of this agreement be or become invalid, this will not affect the remaining terms of this agreement.

Our default attitude towards this attendance is that it promotes the free exchange of ideas and is consistent with our core mission as a project. However, we also want to be careful that the conditions of this attendance are understood on both sides, particularly since authorship on SDSS-IV papers is restricted by the Publication Policy.\nAgreement of Non-disclosure of SDSS-III Data and Results I acknowledge that I have been invited to a private meeting of the SDSS-III collaboration in which proprietary data and papers in preparation based on those data will be discussed.

The purpose of the SISP is to seek proposals to purchase some or all of the Business and Property. Capitalized terms used in this non-disclosure agreement (\u201cNDA\u201d) and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the SISP.\nThe SISP describes the following: (a) the manner in which prospective bidders may participate in the SISP and have access to due diligence materials and Confidential Information (as defined below) concerning the Company, the Business, and the Property; (b) the manner in which bidders may become Qualified Bidders and submit Qualified Bids; (c) the process for the evaluation of the bids received; (d) the process for the ultimate selection of a Successful Bidder; and (e) the process for obtaining such approvals (including the approval of the Court) as may be necessary or appropriate in respect of a Successful Bid.\nIn executing this NDA, you (the \u201cPotential Bidder\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d) acknowledge receipt of a copy of the SISP, attached as Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto, and hereby agree to accept and be bound by the provisions contained therein as the same may be amended, from time to time, with the approval of the Court.\nYou confirm your interest in participating in the SISP initially as a Potential Bidder and with a view to becoming a Qualified Phase I Bidder, a Qualified Phase II Bidder, and a Successful Bidder in order to close a transaction contemplated by such Successful Bid (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). In that regard, you have requested that Confidential Information (as defined herein) be furnished to you. As a condition to us furnishing Confidential Information to you, and in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, you agree on behalf of yourself, your affiliates, and Representatives (as defined herein and to the extent such affiliates and Representatives are in receipt of all or any part of the Confidential Information) as follows:\n1. Confidential Information \u2013 The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means: (a) any and all information of whatever nature (including information in the form not only of written information but also information which may be transmitted orally, visually, graphically, electronically, or by any other means) relating to the Company, the Business, the Property, or the Transaction including, without limitation, information concerning any past, present, or future customers, suppliers or our technology, and any correspondence, internal business discussions, strategic plans, budgets, financial statements, records, reports, evaluations, notes, analyses, documents, engineering, trade secrets, know-how, data, patents, copyrights, processes, business rules, tools, business processes, techniques, programs, designs, formulae, marketing, advertising, financial, commercial, sales or programming materials, equipment configurations, system access codes and passwords, written materials, compositions, drawings, diagrams, computer programs, studies, works in progress, visual demonstrations, ideas, concepts, or any other documents or information pertaining in any way whatsoever to the Company; (b) all information about an identifiable individual or other information that is subject to any federal, provincial, or other applicable statute, law, or regulation of any governmental or regulatory authority in Canada relating to the collection, use, storage, and/or disclosure of information about an identifiable individual, including the Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act (Canada) and equivalent provincial legislation, whether or not any such information is confidential (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d); and (c) all summaries, notes, analyses, compilations, data, studies, or other documents or records prepared by the Potential Bidder or its Representatives that contain or otherwise reflect or have been generated, wholly or partly, or derived from, any such information (\u201cDerivative Information\u201d). The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include such portions of the Confidential Information which: (i) are, or prior to the time of disclosure or utilization become, generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your Representatives; (ii) are received by you from an independent third party who had obtained the Confidential Information lawfully and was under no obligation of secrecy or confidentiality; (iii) you can demonstrate were in your lawful possession before you received such Confidential Information from us; or (iv) you can demonstrate were independently developed by you or on your behalf by personnel having no access to the Confidential Information at the time of its independent development.

You will not use the Confidential Information so as to obtain any commercial advantage over us or in any way which is, directly or indirectly, detrimental to us. Neither you nor any of your affiliates will alter, decompose, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise modify any Confidential Information received hereunder that relates to the research and development, intellectual property, processes, new product developments, product designs, formulae, technical information, patent information, know-how, or trade secrets of the Company. The Potential Bidder agrees to comply with any applicable privacy laws in respect of Confidential Information relating to individuals. The Potential Bidder recognizes and acknowledges the competitive value and confidential nature of the Confidential Information and the damage that could result to the Company if any information contained therein is disclosed to any person.\n3. Storage and Records \u2013 You shall store the Confidential Information properly and securely and ensure that appropriate physical, technological, and organisational measures are in place to protect the Confidential Information against unauthorised or unintended access, use, or disclosure.

You shall keep a record of the Confidential Information furnished to you, in any medium other than oral, and of the location of such Confidential Information.\n4. Access Limited to Representatives \u2013 The Potential Bidder may reveal or permit access to the Confidential Information only to its agents, representatives (including lawyers, accountants, and financial advisors), directors, officers, and employees (each a \u201cRepresentative\u201d) who require access to the Confidential Information for the Permitted Purpose, who are informed by the Potential Bidder of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, who are directed by the Potential Bidder to hold the Confidential Information in the strictest confidence, and who agree to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this NDA. The Potential Bidder will take all necessary precautions or measures as may be reasonable in the circumstances to prevent improper access to the Confidential Information or use or disclosure of the Confidential Information by the Potential Bidder\u2019s Representatives and will be responsible and liable for any breach of this NDA by any of the Potential Bidder\u2019s Representatives. You will, in the event of a breach of this NDA or any disclosure of Confidential Information by you or any of your Representatives, other than as permitted by this NDA through accident, inadvertence, or otherwise, notify us of the nature of the breach promptly upon your discovery of the breach or disclosure.\nYou acknowledge that certain of our books, records, or information representing or containing Confidential Information to which you may be given access are books, records, and information to which solicitor-client privilege and/or litigation privilege (\u201cPrivilege\u201d) attaches. You recognize and acknowledge that we have a material interest in the preservation of Privilege in respect of all Privileged material (collectively, the \u201cPrivileged Material\u201d). You agree (acting on your own behalf and as agent for your Representatives) that: (a) such access is being provided solely for the Permitted Purpose; (b) such access is not intended and should not be interpreted as a waiver of any Privilege in respect of Privileged Material or any right to assert or claim Privilege in respect of Privileged Material. To the extent there is any waiver, it is intended to be a limited waiver in your favour, solely for the Permitted Purpose; (c) you shall keep the Privileged Material in strict confidence, and disclose such material solely to your legal counsel and to your directors, officers, and employees and any affiliate and only to the extent required for the Permitted Purpose; (d) at our request, all copies of Privileged Material, and any notes that would disclose the contents of Privileged Material, will be destroyed or returned to the owner thereof; and (e) at our request, you shall claim or assert, or co-operate to claim or assert, Privilege in respect of our Privileged Material.\n5. No Disclosure of Transaction \u2013 The Potential Bidder and its Representatives will not, without our prior written consent, disclose to any person the fact that the Confidential Information has been made available, that this NDA has been entered into, that discussions or negotiations are taking place or have taken place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction or the SISP.\n6.

Proprietary Rights \u2013 You acknowledge that the Confidential Information is a proprietary asset of the Company and its affiliates and agree that, as between you and the Company, the Company will retain proprietary rights in the Confidential Information and the disclosure of such Confidential Information shall not be deemed to confer upon you any rights whatsoever in respect of any Confidential Information.\n8. Return of Confidential Information \u2013 If you determine not to pursue a Transaction, you will advise us of that fact forthwith upon such determination being made. At the time of such notice, or if, at any earlier time, we so direct (whether or not you determine to pursue a Transaction), you and your Representatives will, at your own expense, promptly return or destroy all copies of the Confidential Information upon our request (and, in any event, within five (5) business days after such request), except for that portion of the Confidential Information which consists of Derivative Information, which will be destroyed, and in the case of information stored in electronic form, it will be permanently erased. If requested by us, compliance with this Section 8 shall be certified in writing by an authorized officer of the Potential Bidder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing: (a) you may retain a copy of the Confidential Information to the extent that such retention is required to demonstrate compliance with applicable law, regulation, or professional standards, provided that it is kept strictly confidential; and (b) Confidential Information that is electronically stored may be retained in back-up servers if it is not intentionally made available to any person, and is deleted in accordance with your normal policies with respect to the retention of electronic records. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Confidential Information, you and your Representatives shall continue to be bound by the confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n9. No Representation \u2013 You acknowledge that neither we nor any of our Representatives make any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information, and agree that neither we nor our Representatives shall have any liability, direct or indirect, to you or your Representatives relating to or resulting from the Confidential Information or the use thereof, errors therein, or omissions therefrom and except in accordance with any specific representations and warranties made in any Definitive Agreement entered into regarding the Transaction. This NDA does not create any obligation between the Company and the Potential Bidder nor any of their respective Representatives to negotiate and enter into a Transaction.\n10. Definitive Agreement \u2013 You acknowledge and agree that no agreement relating to or providing for the Transaction shall exist unless and until a Definitive Agreement with respect to Transaction has been executed by you and us (or any of our affiliates). It is agreed that unless and until such a Definitive Agreement has been executed and delivered pursuant to the terms of the SISP, neither we nor you shall have any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the completion of the Transaction by virtue of this NDA except as otherwise contemplated by the SISP. We and you further understand and agree that: (a) we are under no obligation to provide Confidential Information and any data room containing Confidential Information may be closed by us at any time; and (b) you shall not have any claim whatsoever against us (nor any of our affiliates or Representatives) arising out of or relating to the completion of the Transaction (other than as expressly set forth in a subsequent Definitive Agreement entered into by us and you in connection with the Transaction and pursuant to the terms of the SISP). The process leading up to a Transaction shall be governed by the applicable terms of the SISP. Subject to the SISP, either party to this NDA may terminate discussions and negotiations with regard to the Transaction at any time for any reason.\n11. Required Disclosure \u2013 In the event that you or any of your Representatives become legally compelled or are required by regulatory authorities having appropriate jurisdiction to disclose any of the Confidential Information, you will promptly provide us with written notice so that we may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this NDA. You will cooperate with us on a reasonable basis to obtain a protective order or other remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or we waive compliance with the provisions of this NDA, you will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which you are advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information so furnished.\n12. Non-Solicitation; No-Hire \u2013 Without prior written consent of the Company, for a period of two (2) years from the date of this NDA (the \u201cRestriction Period\u201d), the Potential Bidder, its Representatives, and its affiliates will not, either directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ, or otherwise contract for the services of (or cause or seek to cause to leave the employ of us or any of our affiliates) any person who is now employed or engaged (either as an employee or consultant) or becomes employed or engaged during the term of this NDA by us in our operations, other than persons whose employment or engagement shall have been terminated at least six (6) months prior to the date of such solicitation, employment, or other contractual arrangements.

Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement the following terms have the meanings specified for them:\n1.1. \u201cAffiliate\u201d means any corporation, company or other entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party to this Agreement. An entity is regarded as in control of another or owning another if it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors or other persons performing similar functions.\n1.2. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d \u2013 Confidential Information is any information of the Discloser of actual or potential commercial value owing to the fact that it is unknown to third parties; disclosed by the Discloser to the Recipient in writing, by way of document delivery, including in an electronic format safeguarded from unauthorised access to the information in transit; related to business or financial plans or strategies, financial reports or accounting (except to the extent contemplated by the law), contractual relations, pricing and marketing of goods, products or services, technical information, commercial secrets, know-how, research, production plans, concepts, intellectual property items (including inventions, discoveries, innovative ideas, useful models, designs, production prototypes not covered by patent for whatever reason, computer programmes, databases, trademark designs not registered for whatever reason).\nNo information which has become public and to which the Discloser has provided access for third parties without limitation or which has become public other than through the fault of the Recipient (but not before it becomes publicly circulated), which the Recipient is able to prove that it had been in the possession of before it was disclosed by the Discloser or that such information was provided without liability to maintain confidentiality, will be deemed confidential.\nNo information which the Recipient is able to prove it has created without using Confidential Information will be deemed confidential.\n1.3. \u201cDiscloser\u201d means the party disclosing Confidential Information under this Agreement.\n1.4. \u201cRecipient\u201d means the party receiving Confidential Information under this Agreement.\n2. Subject of the Agreement. Parties\u2019 obligations to maintain confidentiality of Confidential Information on the terms provided by this Agreement constitute the subject of this Agreement.\n2.1. The Discloser will disclose to the Recipient confidential information related to implementation of a service for receiving compensation for delayed and canceled flights.\n2.2. The Recipient and its Representatives having access to Confidential Information must use Confidential Information exclusively for the purposes for which Confidential Information was disclosed and not use it for any other purpose.\n2.3. Neither Party will disclose the fact of existence of this Agreement without prior approval from the other Party.\n2.4. The Recipient will ensure that information is stored securely and cannot be accessed by any individuals, except the Representatives, including outside business hours.\n2.5. In the event that any fact of Confidential Information disclosure to third parties becomes known to the Recipient, it will contact the Discloser immediately, advising of such a fact and of any actions it is taking to reduce the damage.\n3. Permitted Use. Recipient shall keep Discloser\u2019s Confidential Information confidential and use Confidential Information only for the above-stated Purpose of Disclosure, or for performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information internally within its organization (including Affiliates) only on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis, and except for Cardholder Information which shall not be disclosed, to its outside attorneys, consultants, contractors and sub-contractors (\u201cRepresentatives\u201d), only to the extent those individuals are bound by a legal obligation or agreement that is as protective of the Confidential Information as this Agreement. A Recipient is fully responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any of its Affiliates or Representatives. A Recipient shall use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as it uses to prevent unauthorized disclosure of its own Confidential Information. Except for the permitted uses and disclosures expressly set out in this Agreement, no other uses or disclosures are permitted.\n3.1. A failure to comply with Clause 3.1 of this Agreement will serve good ground for terminating access to Confidential Information, whereby the Discloser becomes entitled to a unilateral refusal to execution of any agreements made between the Parties, by which the Recipient is to receive or has received access to Confidential Information.\n3.2. In the event that the confidentiality terms in the agreements made by the Parties, by which the Recipient is to be or has been given access to the Confidential Information, and in this Agreement prove to be contradictory, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.\n4. Exceptions. This Agreement imposes no obligation on a Recipient with respect to Confidential Information that:\n(a) is or becomes publicly known through no breach of this Agreement;\n(b) is rightfully received by the Recipient from a third party that has no applicable duty of confidentiality;\n(c) is or becomes the subject of a patent, in which case a party shall rely upon its rights under applicable patent law;\n(d) is disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written consent of the Discloser. A party also may disclose Confidential Information if required by court order, governmental demand, or other compulsory legal process, provided that if legally permitted to do so it first notify the Discloser in writing at least ten (10) days in advance in order to afford Discloser an opportunity to seek a protective order or other relief.\n5. Mandatory Disclosure. If the Recipient is required by the law to disclose Confidential Information, it will advise the Discloser immediately. The Recipient undertakes to disclose information exclusively to the extent required by the applicable law.\n6. Ownership. As between the parties, Discloser and Recipient, respectively, will retain all right, title and interest to any Confidential Information provided or disclosed by such party under this Agreement. The Discloser reserves the right to analyze the actions taken by the Recipient to safeguard Confidential Information. If the Recipient refuses to share information on the actions it is taking to safeguard Confidential Information or if such actions are found to be inadequate for safeguarding Confidential Information, the Discloser may refuse to disclose Confidential Information or unilaterally refuse to perform under any agreement made between the Parties, by which the Recipient is to receive or has received access to Confidential Information.\n7. Return or Destruction. Upon Discloser\u2019s written request, a Recipient shall promptly return all Confidential Information received under this Agreement, together with all copies, or certify in writing that it has destroyed all such materials.\n8. No Commitment. Each party acknowledges that the other party may be evaluating similar business opportunities or proposals with third parties, or developing systems, products, or services that are similar in nature to the other party\u2019s current or planned offerings. Nothing in this Agreement limits the right of either party to develop, procure or market systems, products, or services that may be similar to or competitive with those of the other party; provided that no unauthorized use or disclosure of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information is used in such activities. In addition, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prevent either party from entering into negotiations or business relationships with any third party, even if such third party is a competitor of a party to this Agreement.\n9. No Licenses or Joint Venture. No party acquires any intellectual property rights under this Agreement (including patent, copyright, or trademark rights). Neither party shall make any use of the trademarks, trade names, or service marks of the other party without express written consent.\n10. Liability of the parties. A Party defaulting under this Agreement will reimburse the other Party for any loss resulting from disclosure or unlawful use of Confidential Information. Losses will be reimbursed according to the law of Singapore.\n11. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that improper disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to the Discloser, and that remedies at law for any such breach could be inadequate. In the event of a breach or threatened breach, Discloser has the right to seek injunctive relief (in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or equity) without the need to post a bond or other security or demonstrate the confidential nature of its Confidential Information. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement is entitled to its reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in connection with any dispute arising under this Agreement.\n12. No Obligation to Disclose. This Agreement does not obligate any party to disclose Confidential Information. By disclosing Confidential Information, however, the Discloser represents and warrants that it has all rights necessary to make the disclosure.\n13. Duration of Obligations. Recipient\u2019s obligations under this Agreement end five (5) years after the date of first disclosure hereunder.\n14. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such assignment or transfer without written consent will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.\n15. Notices. All notices under this Agreement must be in writing and delivered by hand, overnight delivery, or certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Contacts for Legal Notice and Business Information Exchange identified above.\n16. Governing Law. The terms of this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by 3 (three) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Singapore, Singapore. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Parties from applying for a preliminary or injunctive remedy available under applicable laws for any purpose.\n17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, with respect to such subject matter.\n18. Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will be severed with the rest of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect.\n"","

"      PURCHASING & SUPPLY GROUP\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made effective as of the [\u25cf] day of [\u25cf], 201[\u25cf] by and between Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP (\u201cCGSH\u201d), a limited liability partnership with registered offices at 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20006 (the \u201cPremises\u201d), and [\u25cf] (the \u201cSupplier\u201d) with registered office at [\u25cf] (each a \u201cParty,\u201d and, together, the \u201cParties\u201d). For the purposes of this Agreement, CGSH includes its wholly owned subsidiaries, as well as its affiliates, branches, and offices both in and outside the United States, and the Premises includes all offices of the foregoing.\nIn consideration of CGSH hiring the Supplier to perform [\u25cf] services (the \u201cServices\u201d), including as may be set forth in an agreement between the Parties (the \u201cServices Agreement\u201d), and since the Supplier may be provided with or come into contact with confidential and proprietary information belonging to CGSH or its clients (each a \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and together the \u201cDisclosing Parties\u201d) in connection with its provision of Services, the Supplier hereby agrees as follows:\n1. SUPPLIER\u2019S DUTY OF NON-DISCLOSURE\nA. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all confidential, proprietary, or non-public information of the Disclosing Parties (however recorded or preserved) that is disclosed or made available, directly or indirectly, by CGSH or its respective employees, officers, representatives or advisors to the Supplier or its affiliates, representatives, employees or agents, relating to the business of such Disclosing Party or that otherwise by its nature would be reasonably understood as confidential, whether provided in written or oral form and in any manner whatsoever. Without limiting the foregoing, Confidential Information may include confidential or proprietary information owned by a third party and used under license by a Disclosing Party.\nB. The Supplier agrees that it may only access and interact with any Confidential Information made available to it to the extent necessary for it to perform the Services. The Supplier further agrees that, as a recipient of Confidential Information: (i) except as expressly permitted by an applicable Services Agreement, it shall not, for any purpose, use, disclose, reproduce, transfer or reduce to writing or otherwise record the Confidential Information; (ii) it shall maintain in confidence the Confidential Information and shall, with respect to such Confidential Information, use the same degree of care and exercise reasonable efforts to protect such Confidential Information as it uses and exercises with respect to protecting its own similar confidential and/or proprietary information, but in all events no less than reasonable efforts and care; (iii) it shall only disclose Confidential Information to those of its or its affiliates\u2019 employees (a) to whom it is necessary to disclose such Confidential Information for performance of the Services, (b) to whom it has advised of the terms of this Agreement, and (c) who have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement; (iv) it shall cause the employees to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed pursuant to Section 1.B(iii) to comply with the terms of this Agreement, and it shall be responsible for such compliance and fully liable for any failure to comply; and (v) except as set forth in Section 1.B(iii), it shall not disclose or in any way disseminate or make available any Confidential Information disclosed or otherwise made available to it or in its possession to any other party.\nC. The Supplier shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it and its affiliates, and their respective representatives, employees and agents, and shall take all reasonable measures to prevent such parties from using, disclosing, reproducing, transferring, reducing to writing or otherwise recording the Confidential Information as prohibited by this Agreement. If it becomes known to the Supplier that (i) it or its affiliates, representatives, employees or agents have breached any of the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) facts and/or circumstances exist that could be reasonably expected to result in disclosure of any Confidential Information, the Supplier shall in each case immediately notify CGSH of such breach, facts and/or circumstances, and, in the case of (ii), shall use its best efforts to remedy the facts and/or circumstances that would lead to such disclosure (to the extent such facts and/or circumstances may be within the Supplier\u2019s control upon such exercise of best efforts).\nD. The Supplier agrees that the restrictions on use and disclosure of Confidential Information under this Agreement shall not apply to the Supplier for information that: (i) is now or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of the Supplier, generally known or available to the public other than through a breach of an obligation of confidentiality to CGSH; (ii) was known to the Supplier prior to encountering such information from the performance of its Services; (iii) was lawfully obtained by the Supplier from third parties, provided that such third parties were not restricted or obligated to keep such information confidential; or (iv) is required to be disclosed by law, any order of court or any competent regulatory authority, subject to the further provisions of this clause. In the event that the Supplier is required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the requirements of applicable law, rules, regulations, court or other governmental authority, the Supplier shall provide prompt advance notice (in writing, if practical) to CGSH in order to enable CGSH to contest such requirement of disclosure or seek an appropriate protective order, and shall disclose such Confidential Information only to the extent the Supplier reasonably determines it is legally compelled to disclose such Confidential Information and with respect to which it agrees to exercise its best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded therefor.\nE. Confidential Information disclosed or made available under this Agreement and any intellectual property or proprietary rights therein are and shall remain the property of CGSH. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to imply the grant of any license to make, use or sell or otherwise commercialize any Confidential Information. Further, the Supplier acknowledges that any Confidential Information disclosed or made available to it is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and that EACH DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, CORRECTNESS OR COMPLETENESS OF SUCH CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES.\nF. Upon the termination of the Services for any reason or at the written request of a Disclosing Party at any time, the Supplier shall destroy (and promptly deliver a certification of such destruction) or promptly deliver to each Disclosing Party, or to the requesting Disclosing Party as the case may be, all tangible embodiments of such Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information in the Supplier\u2019s or its employees\u2019 possession, including but not limited to copies, notes, packages, pictures, diagrams, computer memory media and all other tangible embodiments of, or materials containing, any portion of the Confidential Information.\n2. DATA PROTECTION\nEach Party shall (and shall procure that each of its relevant affiliates shall), and shall use reasonable endeavors to procure that any third party subcontractors shall, comply with their respective obligations under all applicable law regarding data protection in relation to all Personal Data and Confidential Information (together, \u201cProtected Data\u201d) that is processed by it in the course of performing its obligations under this Agreement, and take such steps as are reasonably required by the other Party to ensure that the other Party is able to comply with such law. This includes maintaining a valid and up to date registration or notification under applicable law relating to data protection. \u201cPersonal Data\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d and \u201cprocessed\u201d (when used in the context of Personal Data) have the meanings given to those terms in the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the applicable implementing legislation in any country including the Data Protection Act 1998 (the \u201cData Protection Laws\u201d).\nCGSH acknowledges that, to the extent the Supplier is a data processor within the meaning of the Data Protection Laws, the Supplier shall (and shall use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that its sub-contractors shall) (i) only process Confidential Information, including any client data, in accordance with CGSH\u2019s instructions and (ii) bring into effect and maintain all reasonable technical and organizational measures to maintain security, prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to or processing of Personal Data, and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing the measures, so as to ensure a level of security appropriate to: (A) the harm that may result from breach of those measures; and (B) the nature of the Personal Data to be protected.\nFurther, the Data Protection Laws make it mandatory that CGSH obtain contractual guarantees from all third parties who will be given access to or who become aware of Protected Data during the course of their visits to the Premises in order that they may undertake the role of a service provider. The Data Protection Laws also require CGSH to ensure they have measures in place to prevent the unauthorized or unlawful use of Protected Data and to prevent accidental loss, destruction or damage to any personal information. The Supplier must therefore ensure, by way of written contract between it and its employees, subcontractors and individuals visiting the Premises on the Supplier\u2019s behalf (each a \u201cContractor\u201d and, together, the \u201cContractors\u201d), that if at any time a Contractor becomes aware of Protected Data the Supplier or its Contractors will not (i) share this information with anyone outside of CGSH, (ii) take any information away from the Premises, and/or (iii) duplicate or copy any Protected Data.\n3. SURVIVAL; REMEDY\nA. This Agreement and the obligations herein shall survive indefinitely, regardless of whether or not the Supplier is still providing Services at the Premises.\nB. The Supplier acknowledges that the unauthorized use or disclosure of a Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information or any breach of this Agreement by the Supplier may cause such Disclosing Party to suffer irreparable injury not compensable by monetary damages and for which such Disclosing Party may not have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the Supplier agrees that CGSH will have the right to seek, without the posting of any bond or security or the giving of any undertaking as to damages or otherwise, specific performance or other injunctive or equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary or desirable to prevent, curtail or remedy any such unauthorized use or disclosure, whether threatened or actual. The rights of CGSH set forth in this paragraph shall be in addition to, and without prejudice to, any other rights that CGSH may have hereunder, whether at law or in equity.\n4. MISCELLANEOUS\nA. To the extent any applicable Services Agreement contains terms with respect to confidentiality that conflict with, or are less restrictive with respect to the Supplier\u2019s obligations than, those set forth in Sections 1-3 herein, the terms of this Agreement govern.\nB. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The Parties hereby agree and consent to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the County and State of New York with respect to claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement.\nC. All notices, requests, consents, demands and other communications provided for by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and received when sent by first class mail at any general or branch post office enclosed in a registered or certified postpaid envelope, addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth at the beginning of this Agreement, with a copy to the attention of the respective Parties as follows:\nCGSH: Purchasing & Supply Group\nSupplier: [e.g. General Counsel,]\nor to such changed address as such Parties may have fixed by notice; provided, however, that any notice of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule, law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, such provision shall be construed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting and reducing such provision so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent under applicable law and consistent with the original intent of the Parties. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties as to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind and every nature between the Parties. Any and all prior arrangements, representations, promises, understandings and conditions in connection with such matter, and any representations, promises or conditions not expressly incorporated herein or expressly made a part hereof shall not be binding upon any Party. This Agreement shall not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between the Parties and shall not be construed to create any obligation on the part of either Party to retain the services of or to compensate the other Party in any manner. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the day and year first above written.\n[Signature page follows]\nCleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP [\u25cf]\nBy: By:\n(Signature) (Signature)\nName: Name:\n(type or print) (type or print)\nTitle: Title:\n(type or print) (type or print)\n"","

Equitable Relief. The Receiving Company acknowledges and agrees that Owner may be irreparably injured, such that money damages alone may not be adequate remedy, and will be entitled to equitable relief (including, without limitation, the granting of specific performance and injunctive relief in Owner\u2019s favor), if the Receiving Company or any person to whom the Receiving Company discloses any Confidential Information breaches or threatens to breach the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Company agrees that equitable relief is not exclusive of other remedies to which Owner may be entitled at law or in equity. The Receiving Company further agrees to waive, and cause its Representatives to waive, any requirement for securing or posting any bond in connection with the pursuit of any such remedy.\n9.

Nothing in this Agreement shall in any manner obligate either Party to proceed with the Transaction, whether on the terms suggested by the Receiving Company, or on any other terms.

The Receiving Company\u2019s obligation to maintain the Confidential Information confidential as provided in this Agreement shall survive any decision by Owner not to proceed with the Transaction, or to proceed with a party other than the Receiving Company.\n10. Access to Employees.

Each party, as a Receiving Party, agrees that it will:\n(a) not use, or authorize the use of, such Confidential Information for any purpose other than for the evaluation, negotiation and, if applicable, consummation of the Potential Transaction;\n(b) other than as permitted by Section 4 of this Agreement, hold such Confidential Information in strict confidence and protect such Confidential Information with the same degree of care (but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care) such party normally uses to protect its own information that is similar in type or nature to the Confidential Information;\n(c) not disclose such Confidential Information to any person other than to those of its and/or its affiliated companies\u2019 respective employees, stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers, advisors, agents, accountants, attorneys, representatives and/or consultants (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), in each case, who (i) need to know such Confidential Information to facilitate the evaluation, negotiation and, if applicable, consummation of the Potential Transaction, and (ii) are advised of the confidential and proprietary nature of such Confidential Information and are bound by confidentiality obligations (which may be contained in such Representatives\u2019 engagement agreements) that limit the further use and disclosure of such Confidential Information;\n(d) not copy or reproduce all or any part of such Confidential Information in any medium, except as may be strictly necessary to facilitate the use of Confidential Information as permitted by this Agreement; and\n(e) not decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer all or any part of such Confidential Information.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any use of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information by any Representative of the Receiving Party must be in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting any obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breaches of this Agreement by its Representatives.\n4. Disclosure Compelled by Law or Judicial Proceeding. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose any portion of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party (i) by operation of law or in connection with a judicial or governmental proceeding or arbitration (whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process), (ii) pursuant to the rules or regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (or any other applicable securities regulatory body) or (iii) pursuant to the rules or regulations of any securities exchange on which the Receiving Party\u2019s or its parent company\u2019s securities are listed or similar self-regulatory body, then such disclosure will be permissible only if and after the Receiving Party promptly notifies the Disclosing Party of such requirement (to the extent legally permitted) so that the Disclosing Party (at its sole cost and expense) may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In no event will the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives oppose any action by the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or assurance of confidential treatment to preserve the confidentiality of any such Confidential Information. If as a result of any such requirement the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information or the existence, content or status of negotiations relating to the specific transactions contemplated by the Potential Transaction, the Receiving Party may furnish, without liability hereunder, that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information which it is required to disclose.\n5. Ownership of Confidential Information. All rights in, and title to, the Confidential Information supplied by a Disclosing Party remain in such Disclosing Party. Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure of any Confidential Information will be construed as granting to the Receiving Party (either expressly, by implication or estoppel, or otherwise) any license or immunity under any copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, or other intellectual property right now or hereafter owned or controlled by the Disclosing Party, or any right to use, exploit or further develop the same, except solely to effectuate the evaluation of the Potential Transaction.\n6. No Further Obligations; No Violation; Export Controls. This Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create, any obligation to enter into any other agreement with respect to the Confidential Information or the Potential Transaction. Neither party shall be under any obligation hereunder to continue any discussions or negotiations regarding the Potential Transaction and either party may terminate such discussions or negotiations at any time without liability hereunder. Moreover, unless and until a definitive written agreement is entered into, neither party nor any of either party's Representatives shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a transaction except for the matters specifically set forth in this Agreement. Additionally, this Agreement does not constitute or create any obligation of either party to provide any Confidential Information or other information to the other party, rather it merely defines the duties and obligations of each party and its Representatives with respect to the Confidential Information to the extent Confidential Information may be disclosed or made available. Under no circumstances is either party obligated to disclose or make available any information to the other party, including any Confidential Information, which in its sole and absolute discretion it determines not to disclose. Each party acknowledges and understands that the other party does not need or desire to receive any Confidential Information that is government classified information, or is otherwise restricted information, the receipt, disclosure, use or retention of which is made a crime by any provision of applicable statute or the rules and regulations thereunder. The parties accordingly agree that such information will not be provided, either orally, in writing or otherwise. Neither party will transmit nor export, directly or indirectly, any technical data received from the other party, or any product utilizing any such data, in violation of applicable data export laws and regulations.\n7. Competitive Activities. Each party understands that either party may have, or in the future may enter into, relationships with third parties having pre-existing relationships with the other party. Provided that each party complies with its obligations contained herein, and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not in any way limit, restrict or preclude either party from pursuing any of its present or future business activities or interests or from entering into any agreement or transaction with any person, regardless of whether such business activities or interests are competitive with the business activities and interests of the other party and regardless of whether the subject matter of any such agreement or transaction is in any way similar to or different from the transactions considered and evaluated by the parties.\n8. Concurrent/Future Development. Each Disclosing Party understands and agrees that (x) the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives is currently or may become engaged in lines of business the same as or similar to those of the Disclosing Party and that, wholly independent of the information provided hereunder, the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives may currently or in the future be developing internally, or receiving from third parties, information that coincidentally may be similar to portions of the information provided hereunder and/or otherwise competitive with the Disclosing Party's actual or future projects or business, and (y) wholly independent development by the Receiving Party and its affiliates and their respective Representatives of media content, products, programs, services, goods, concepts, opportunities, documents or information that are coincidentally similar to (but not, in whole or part, based upon) any information provided hereunder will not be deemed to violate this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8 is intended to relieve either party from any of its obligations of confidentiality contained in this Agreement.\n9. Material, Non-public Information. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed as to the matters which are the subject of this Agreement, that the United States securities laws may prohibit any person who has received from an issuer any material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n10. No Warranties. EACH RECEIVING PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER RELATING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

Such return, erasure or destruction shall be certified in writing to the other party by an authorized officer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the parties and their Representatives may each retain Confidential Information to the extent required pursuant to legal or regulatory requirements (including internal compliance procedures instituted to satisfy regulatory obligations), and (ii) because electronic systems may retain information for archival purposes or pursuant to automated computer backup procedures, neither party nor its Representatives shall be required to erase electronically stored Confidential Information that has been saved to a back-up file in accordance with such party or its Representatives\u2019 ordinary electronic back-up practices; provided, that any such information so retained shall be held in compliance with the terms of this Agreement.\n13.

Assignment. This Agreement and all rights, duties and obligations hereunder are personal to the undersigned parties and may not be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred by either party, or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any other attempt by either party to assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation herein is void and without effect and will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement and each and every provision hereof will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.\n16. Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information could cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm and that money damages may be inadequate to compensate the Disclosing Party for such harm. Accordingly, in addition to any other available remedies, the Disclosing Party will, subject to the provisions of Section 19, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and/or specific performance.\n17. Publicity Restrictions. Without the other party\u2019s prior written approval, neither party will (a) make or provide any public or private statement or disclosure to any other person (other than its Representatives) concerning the existence of or any aspect of this Agreement, whether the parties have shared or made available any Confidential Information with each other, or the discussions between the parties, except to the extent such disclosure would be permitted pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement; or (b) use the name, likeness or trademarks of the other party or its Representatives, employees or affiliates to express or imply any relationship or affiliation between the parties, or any endorsement of any product or service.

All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof and/or the scope of the provisions of this Section 19 other than actions or proceedings seeking equitable relief (a \u201cProceeding\u201d) shall be submitted to JAMS (\""JAMS\"") for binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less (as applicable, the \u201cRules\u201d) to be held solely in Los Angeles County, California, U.S.A., in the English language in accordance with the provisions below.\n(a) Each arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitral tribunal (the \u201cArbitral Board\u201d) consisting of a single arbitrator who shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge with at least ten (10) years experience in commercial matters. The parties shall be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with Section 1283.05 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, provided that (a) the Arbitral Board must authorize all such discovery in advance based on findings that the material sought is relevant to the issues in dispute and that the nature and scope of such discovery is reasonable under the circumstances, and (b) discovery shall be limited to depositions and production of documents unless the Arbitral Board finds that another method of discovery (e.g., interrogatories) is the most reasonable and cost efficient method of obtaining the information sought.\n(b) There shall be a record of the proceedings at the arbitration hearing and the Arbitral Board shall issue a Statement of Decision setting forth the factual and legal basis for the Arbitral Board's decision. If neither party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the Arbitral Board's decision shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Company, such other court having jurisdiction over Company, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. If either party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the award of the Arbitral Board shall be appealed to three (3) neutral arbitrators (the \""Appellate Arbitrators\""), each of whom shall have the same qualifications and be selected through the same procedure as the Arbitral Board. The appealing party shall file its appellate brief within thirty (30) days after its written notice requesting the appeal and the other party shall file its brief within thirty (30) days thereafter. The Appellate Arbitrators shall thereupon review the decision of the Arbitral Board applying the same standards of review and all of the same presumptions) as if the Appellate Arbitrators were a California Court of Appeal reviewing a judgment of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, except that the Appellate Arbitrators shall in all cases issue a final award and shall not remand the matter to the Arbitral Board. The decision of the Appellate Arbitrators shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Company, such other court having jurisdiction over Company, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. The party appealing the decision of the Arbitral Board shall pay all costs and expenses of the appeal, including the fees of the Appellate Arbitrators and the reasonable outside attorneys' fees of the opposing party, unless the decision of the Arbitral Board is reversed, in which event the costs, fees and expenses of the appeal shall be borne as determined by the Appellate Arbitrators.\n(c) Subject to a party's right to appeal pursuant to the above, neither party shall challenge or resist any enforcement action taken by the party in whose favor the Arbitral Board, or if appealed, the Appellate Arbitrators, decided. Each party acknowledges that it is giving up the right to a trial by jury or court. The Arbitral Board shall have the power to enter temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the Arbitral Board\u2019s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Board or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section. All arbitration proceedings (including proceedings before the Appellate Arbitrators) shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with any claim of breach hereunder, each party hereby irrevocably waives any right or remedy to seek and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief or any order with respect to, and/or to enjoin or restrain or otherwise impair in any manner, the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of any motion picture, television or other audio-visual production related to the other party, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, or the use, publication or dissemination of any advertising in connection with such production; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit a party from seeking or obtaining injunctive or other equitable relief or any order based on a claim that such production uses the other party\u2019s Confidential Information to infringe upon such party's intellectual property rights.\n20.

Either party may terminate discussions at any time.\n9. Remedies. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that money damages might not be a sufficient remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives.

In connection with the Authorized Purpose, certain trade secrets and business information proprietary to the Disclosing Party, and which the Disclosing Party considers confidential, may be provided to the Recipient.\n2. Definition. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information, technical data, or know-how (including, but not limited to, information relating to research, products, software, services, development, inventions, processes, engineering, marketing, techniques, customers, pricing, internal procedures, business and marketing plans or strategies, finances, employees and business opportunities) disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient, either directly or indirectly, in any form whatsoever (including, but not limited to, in writing, in machine readable or other tangible form, orally or visually): (i) that is a trade secret under applicable law; (ii) that has been marked as \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d or similar legend; (iii) whose confidential nature has been made known by the Disclosing Party, orally or in writing, to the Recipient; (iv) that due to its character and nature, a reasonable person under like circumstances would treat as confidential; or (v) discussions relating to such information whether these discussions occur prior to, concurrent with, or following disclosure of such information.\n3. Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include, or shall cease to include, information or material that the Recipient can demonstrate by then-contemporaneous written records: (i) is in the Recipient\u2019s possession at the time of disclosure as shown by the Recipient\u2019s files and records immediately prior to the time of disclosure; (ii) before or after it has been disclosed to Recipient, becomes part of public knowledge or literature, not as a result of any action or inaction of the Recipient; (iii) is approved for release by written authorization of the Disclosing Party; (iv) is disclosed to the Recipient by a third party not in violation of any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to Confidential Information.\n4.

The Recipient and its Representatives shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Disclosing Party in seeking to prevent or limit disclosure; and, in the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Recipient will limit disclosure to the Confidential Information actually required to be disclosed, provided the Recipient exercises its reasonable efforts to obtain reasonable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.

Whereas the Parties wish to explore and enter into certain business transactions (the \u201cSubject Matter\u201d) in connection with which each Party has disclosed and/or may further disclose its Confidential Information (as defined in Section 1.1) to the other Party. This Agreement is intended to allow the protection of each Party\u2019s Confidential Information (including any Confidential Information previously disclosed to the other Party) against unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIn consideration of the above premises and the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information.\n1.1. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information or data, of any kind or nature whatsoever, relating to or otherwise pertaining to a disclosing Party (the \u201cDiscloser\u201d) and/or any of the Discloser\u2019s subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, assigns or representatives, the Discloser\u2019s activities, employees, customers, subscribers, business, affairs, operations systems, software and any other information disclosed and/or otherwise made available to the other Party (the \u201cRecipient\u201d), in any form whatsoever, including any and all analyses, compilations, studies, reports or other documents prepared by the Discloser, or by its directors, officers, employees, advisers, affiliates, agents or representatives, all information relating to or otherwise pertaining to any trade secret, invention, idea, know-how, technical, financial and business information, business plans or processes, information provided by third parties to the Discloser under an obligation of confidentiality, and all information which the Recipient has been exposed to in connection with the Subject Matter. For greater certainty, all information exchanged between the Parties is to be considered Confidential Information, unless specifically stated otherwise. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d will also include this Agreement.\n1.2. The provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to information which (i) is already known to the Recipient, having been disclosed to the Recipient by a third party without such third party having an obligation of confidentiality to the Discloser; (ii) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of the Recipient, its employees, officers, directors or agents; (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder; (iv) is approved for release (and only to the extent so approved) by the Discloser; or (v) subject to Section 3, is disclosed pursuant to the lawful requirement of a court or governmental agency or where required by operation of law.\n2. Non-Disclosure and Non-Use Undertakings.\n2.1. All Confidential Information will be maintained in confidence by the Recipient, will not be disclosed to any person or entity in any way except as provided in this Agreement, and will be protected with the same degree of care the Recipient normally uses in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no case with any less degree than reasonable care.\n2.2. The Confidential Information may be disclosed by the Recipient only to those employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Recipient having the need to receive such Confidential Information for the Subject Matter, provided the recipients of such Confidential Information are already bound by written confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations similar to those undertaken by the Recipient pursuant to this Agreement. The Recipient shall immediately give notice to the Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The Recipient agrees to assist the Discloser in remedying any such unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information.\n2.3. The Recipient will not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Subject Matter and will not use any Confidential Information for obtaining any intellectual property rights for the Recipient or to divert or attempt to divert any business, supplier or customer of the Discloser.\n2.4. The Confidential Information shall not be mechanically copied or otherwise reproduced by the Recipient without the express prior written permission of the Discloser, except for such copies as the Recipient may be required to provide the Subject Matter. All copies shall contain, on reproduction by the Recipient, the same proprietary and confidential notices and legends which appear on the original Confidential Information, unless expressly authorized otherwise by the Discloser prior to reproduction.\n3. Restrictions. To the extent the Recipient is required to disclose any Confidential Information pursuant to a valid subpoena or other applicable order by a governmental agency or judicial body or by operation of law, the Recipient will promptly notify the Discloser in writing of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such disclosure so that the Discloser may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority. The Recipient agrees to cooperate with the Discloser in seeking such order or remedy. The Recipient further agrees that if the Recipient is required to disclose any Confidential Information, the Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable, written assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information.\n4. Other Matters.\n4.1. Neither this Agreement, nor either Party\u2019s performance under this Agreement, will transfer to the Recipient, or be construed to grant the Recipient, any proprietary right, license title, interest, licence or claim in or to any of the Confidential Information, other than the right to use the same strictly for the Subject Matter in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Discloser is and shall remain the full and exclusive owner or licensee of the Confidential Information and the intellectual property rights thereto, including but not limited to derivatives, alterations, modifications and other changes thereto, whether made by the Discloser or the Recipient.\n4.2. The Recipient shall not use the name or any trademark of the Discloser in any manner, including, without limitation, in any press release or other advertising materials of the Recipient or any of its affiliates, without the prior written consent of the Discloser, which consent may be rejected or withdrawn at the Discloser\u2019s sole discretion. For the removal of doubt, an Authorization to Use Corporate Logos shall constitute written consent.\n4.3. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it has the legal power and authority to enter into and perform under this Agreement.\n4.4. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any obligation or any expectation on either Party to enter into a business relationship with the other Party, or an obligation to refrain from entering into a business relationship with any third party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership or employment relationship between the Parties, it being understood that the Parties are independent contractors vis-\u00e0-vis one another. Except as specified herein, no Party shall have the right, power or implied authority to create any obligation or duty, express or implied, on behalf of any other Party hereto.\n5. Equitable Relief. The Recipient agrees that, in the event of any breach of any provision hereof, the Discloser may, or will, not have an adequate remedy in money or damages. The Recipient therefore agrees that, in such event, the Discloser shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against such breach in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such injunctive relief will in no way limit the Discloser\u2019s right to obtain other remedies available at law or in equity.

Term.\nThis Agreement shall remain in effect for a two-year term (subject to a one year extension if the parties are still discussing and considering the Transaction at the end of the second year).

The parties further acknowledge and agree that they each reserve the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to reject any and all proposals and to terminate discussions and negotiations with respect to a Transaction at any time. This Agreement does not create a joint venture or partnership between the parties.

Potential Purchaser recognizes and acknowledges that the Evaluation Materials may contain confidential and/or proprietary information regarding the Company. Potential Purchaser shall maintain the confidentiality of those portions of the Evaluation Materials that contain confidential and/or proprietary information, and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, disclose, those portions of the Evaluation Materials to any third party, except as otherwise set forth herein. Potential Purchaser may disclose the Evaluation Materials to its parents, subsidiaries, parents\u2019 subsidiaries, or affiliates (collectively, the \u201cAffiliated Entities\u201d) and Potential Purchaser\u2019s and/or the Affiliated Entities\u2019, directors, officers, employees, partners, consultants, potential financing sources, joint-venture partners, bankers, accountants, lenders, investors, insurance consultants and/or brokers, attorneys, agents and financial and legal advisors (collectively, such entities or persons to whom Potential Purchaser or an Affiliated Entity discloses the Evaluation Materials, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) who may need access to the Evaluation Materials, in Potential Purchaser\u2019s discretion, for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction. Potential Purchaser shall (i) inform in writing all of its Representatives who receive any portion of the Evaluation Materials of the confidential and proprietary nature thereof and of this Agreement and (ii) direct all such Representatives in writing to comply with the confidentiality and non-use terms of this Agreement. Potential Purchaser shall keep those portions of the Evaluation Materials confidential, as hereinabove provided.\n2. Potential Purchaser shall not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Potential Purchaser and its Affiliated Entities and Representatives may invest in or consider or manage investments in companies that compete either directly or indirectly with the Company and that this Agreement shall in no way be construed to prohibit or restrict Potential Purchaser\u2019s or its Affiliated Entities or Representatives\u2019 ability to make or manage or consider such investments.\n3.

In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not timely obtained, or the Company waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, Potential Purchaser, its Affiliated Entities, and/or its Representatives may furnish and disclose any or all of the Evaluation Materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to the Company shall not be required where disclosure is in connection with a routine audit or examination by, or a blanket document request from, a governmental or regulatory authority having or claiming to have authority to regulate or oversee Potential Purchaser\u2019s business, provided that Potential Purchaser informs such governmental or regulatory authority of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Materials.\n5. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof by the Company preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power and privilege hereunder. It is further understood and agreed that money damages alone may not constitute a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives, and that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief, as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies available to the Company for a breach of this Agreement by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the Company at law or in equity.\n6.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Potential Purchaser, its Affiliated Entities, and its Representatives may retain one or more copies of the Evaluation Materials for the purpose of defending any claim related to this Agreement or any transaction related hereto, or as may be required in accordance with Potential Purchaser\u2019s, its Affiliated Entities, or its Representatives\u2019 respective legal, compliance, computer programs, server, software, and/or automated backup archiving practices.\n7. Potential Purchaser understands that the Company will endeavor to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to the Company which the Company believes to be relevant for the purpose of Potential Purchaser\u2019s evaluation of the Proposed Transaction. Potential Purchaser further understands and acknowledges that the Company does not make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials or any portion thereof. Potential Purchaser agrees that neither the Company nor its agents shall have any liability to Potential Purchaser or any of its Representatives resulting from the use of the Evaluation Materials by Potential Purchaser or its Representatives by virtue of this Agreement.\n8. Unless and until a definitive binding agreement is entered into between the Company and Potential Purchaser (or any of its affiliates) with respect to the Proposed Transaction, none of the parties hereto will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever to consummate, or otherwise with respect to, any Proposed Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such definitive binding agreement, neither party hereto shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.\n9.

Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity to the Disclosing Party.\n8.

Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to, personal data as defined in this Agreement or by applicable law, whichever is broader, and personal data shall not be required to be marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d to be treated as Confidential Information under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, \u201cpersonal data\u201d means any information relating: (i) to an identified; or (ii) to a directly or indirectly identifiable, natural person.

Except as provided herein, the parties agree that any disclosures contemplated hereunder, and any discussions or communications between the parties relating thereto, shall not restrict either party\u2019s right to take whatever future actions such party unilaterally determines to be in its best interests, including the right to discontinue discussions with the other party at any time or to undertake similar discussions or to enter into agreements or relationships with third parties covering subjects related to the matters covered herein. All provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision or part thereof is deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then such term shall be construed to reflect the closest lawful interpretation of the parties\u2019 original intent, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid, enforceable and binding.

In any such event, the Receiving Party shall help the Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to regain possession of the Confidential Information and/or Notes and shall prevent any further unauthorized disclosure or use. This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except for the foregoing, neither party may assign this Agreement or any of their rights and obligations hereunder or delegate the performance thereof to a third party without the prior written consent of the other party. Except as stated herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any benefit to any third party or any right to enforce any term of this Agreement. Any failure by a party hereto to enforce the other party\u2019s strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that party\u2019s right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.\n8.

Principal and Surviving Corporation have accordingly entered into an Employment and Consulting Agreement dated August 6, 2003 (the \""EMPLOYMENT AND CONSULTING AGREEMENT\"").\nE. Principal owns approximately 38% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, and will receive considerable financial benefit when the Merger becomes effective.\nF. The Merger Agreement requires that Principal, Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition enter into this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties agree as follows (unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Merger Agreement):\n1. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Agreement shall take effect on the Merger Effective Date.\n2. NON-COMPETITION. In order to induce Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition to enter into the Merger Agreement and to pay the valuable consideration required thereunder, to create a valuable independent asset of PFG Acquisition, to preserve and protect the goodwill thereof, and to enhance the going concern value and earnings of PFG Acquisition in future years, Principal undertakes and agrees as follows:\n(a) Commencing on the effective date hereof and continuing thereafter until December 31, 2005 (the \""RESTRICTION PERIOD\""), Principal shall not, within the United States (the \""TERRITORY\""), create, seek or accept employment or compensation of any kind or character from any enterprise, or person associated with any enterprise that is engaged or planning to engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture, sale, marketing, promotion or sale of products in the brown shoe market segment of the men's footwear business (a \""COMPETING ENTERPRISE\""); provided, however, that Principal may accept employment as a salesman or as a sales representative with any such Competing Enterprise without violating the foregoing.\n(b) During the Term, neither Principal nor any entity in which Principal may be interested (as a principal, owner, partner, joint venturer, trustee, director, officer, shareholder, option holder, security holder, lender, creditor, guarantor, advisor, member or in any other capacity other than solely as a salesman or as a sales representative) shall, within the Territory, engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity that, directly or indirectly, manufactures, markets, promotes or engages in the sale of products in the brown shoe market segment of the men's footwear business; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to prevent Principal from investing in securities if (i) such class of securities in which the investment so made is listed on a national securities exchange or is issued by a company registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, so long as such investment holdings do not, in the aggregate, constitute more than five percent (5%) of the voting power of the entity issuing such securities; and (ii) any other securities so long as such investment holdings do not constitute more than two percent (2%) of the voting power of the entity issuing such securities.\n(c) During the Term, without the Company's written consent, Principal shall not, either in his individual capacity or as an agent for another: (i) hire or offer to hire any of Company's, Phoenix Footwear's or PFG Acquisition's officers, employees, or agents; (ii) entice away or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade any of Company's, Phoenix Footwear's or PFG Acquisition's officers, employees, or agents to discontinue their relationship with Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition; (iii) contract, solicit, divert, or attempt to divert from Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition any business whatsoever by influencing or attempting to influence any customer of Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition with whom Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition has engaged in sales discussions prior to the termination of this Agreement; or (iv) contract, solicit, divert, or attempt to divert from Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition any supplier or vendor.\n(d) The covenants set forth in this Section 2 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants covering their subject matter in each of the separate states within the Territory and, except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms to the covenant set forth above in this Section 2. To the extent that any such covenant shall be judicially unenforceable in any one or more of such states, such covenant shall not be affected with respect to each of the other states in the Territory. Each covenant with respect to each such state in the Territory shall be construed as severable and independent.\n(e) Phoenix Footwear, PGG Acquisition and Principal acknowledge and recognize that these covenants not to compete are integral to the Merger Agreement, that without the protection of such covenants, Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition would not have entered into the Merger Agreement, that the consideration paid by Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition under the Merger Agreement bears no relationship to the damages Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition may suffer in the event of any breach of the covenants, and that such covenants contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of activity to be restrained necessary to protect Phoenix Footwear's and PFG Acquisition's business interests. If this Section 2 shall for any reason be held excessively broad as to time, duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be enforceable to the extent compatible with then-applicable laws.\n3. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that:\n(i) The Company assets being merged into PFG Acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement include confidential and proprietary information of Company and, in the course of his employment for PFT Acquisition, Principal may develop and obtain access to confidential and proprietary information of Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition (collectively, the \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\""), which Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, all of the following materials and information of Company, Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition (whether or not reduced to writing and whether or not patentable or protected by copyright): trade secrets, product specifications, proprietary software systems, sources of data, databases, know-how, formulae, inventions and ideas, designs, sketches, photographs, graphs, drawings, samples, selling and pricing information, procedures, research methodologies, customer lists, business and marketing plans, current and anticipated customer requirements, market studies, supplier lists, operational methods, product development plans and personnel plans. The parties hereto agree that the failure of any Confidential Information to be marked or otherwise labeled as confidential or proprietary information shall not affect its status as Confidential Information.\n(ii) The Confidential Information is confidential and proprietary, and the development and protection of the Confidential Information represents a substantial investment having a great economic and commercial value to Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition.\n(iii) Phoenix Footwear and PFG Acquisition would be irreparably damaged if any of the Confidential Information was disclosed to, or used or exploited on behalf of, any person other than Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition.\n(b) Principal covenants and agrees that he shall not, at any time, during the Restrictions Period, directly or indirectly, use, exploit, or disclose to any person or entity, without the prior written consent of Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition, any Confidential Information, except as expressly authorized by Phoenix Footwear or PFG Acquisition during the performance of Principal's duties for and with PFG Acquisition.\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Principal may use, exploit, or disclose Confidential Information, but only to the extent that such Confidential Information (i) is or becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of Principal; or (ii) is disclosed pursuant to the requirement of a governmental agency or a court of law or otherwise required by operation of law, provided that Principal gives PFG Acquisition and Phoenix Footwear prompt written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure.\n4. REASONABLENESS OF RESTRICTIONS. PRINCIPAL HAS CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDERED THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 2 AND 3 HEREOF AND, HAVING DONE SO, HEREBY AGREES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN SUCH SECTIONS ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE AND ARE REASONABLY REQUIRED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF PHOENIX FOOTWEAR AND PFG Acquisition.\n5.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\"" means any and all information and material disclosed by SABI to Victorinox (before or after the signing of this Agreement, and whether orally or in writing, graphic, electronic or any other form) that is marked or described as, identified orally or in writing as, or provided under circumstances indicating it is, confidential, proprietary or not otherwise available to the general public at the time of such disclosure.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE AND LIMITED USE.\nVictorinox shall hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party. Victorinox shall disclose the Confidential Information only to its employees and agents who need to know such information and who are bound by restrictions regarding disclosure and use of such information comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth herein. Victorinox shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the unauthorized use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Confidential Information. The obligations of this Section 2 with respect to any item of Confidential Information shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n3. SCOPE.\nThe obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall not apply with respect to any Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is\nor becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the Victorinox, or to the extent that disclosure of such Confidential Information is required by law.\n4. REMEDIES.\nVictorinox agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information will cause irreparable harm and significant injury to SABI, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Victorinox agrees that SABI, in addition to any other available remedies, shall have the right to an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, without the necessity of posting any bond or other security.\n5. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS.\nVictorinox hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and it will advise its employees and agents to whom it discloses Confidential Information, that the United States securities laws generally prohibit persons who receive from an issuer material, non-public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to purchase or sell such securities.\n6. MISCELLANEOUS.\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized signatories of both parties. The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of or default under the same or any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver of any right or remedy. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreements.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n1 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation. Commencing on the date hereof and ending on the last day of the Restricted Period (as defined below), Ermilio covenants and agrees that he will not, without the Purchaser's prior written consent, directly or indirectly, either on behalf of himself or on behalf of any business venture, as an employee, consultant, partner, principal, stockholder, officer, director, trustee, agent, or otherwise (other than on behalf of the Purchaser or its Affiliates):\n(A) be employed by, engage or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or act in any advisory, expert, consulting or other capacity for, any entity or individual that competes with the Purchaser or its Affiliates in the areas of pension administration, insurance product sales, investment advisory services and other retirement products, in the following territory: in Pennsylvania - the counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia; and in New Jersey - the counties of Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer and Salem;\n(B) solicit or divert any business or any customer from the Purchaser or its Affiliates or assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so or attempting to do so;\n(C) cause or seek to cause any person, firm or corporation to refrain from dealing or doing business with the Purchaser or its Affiliates or assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so; or\n(D) hire, solicit or divert from the Purchaser or its Affiliates any of their respective employees, consultants or agents who have, at any time during the immediately preceding one (1) year period from the date hereof or the Restricted Period, been engaged by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, nor assist any person, firm, corporation or other entity in doing so.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Affiliates\"" shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under the common control of the Purchaser. For the purpose of this Agreement, \""control\"" shall mean the direct or indirect ownership of fifty (50%) percent or more of the outstanding shares or other voting rights of an entity or possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of management and policies of an entity.\nAs used in this Agreement, \""Restricted Period\"" means the period commencing on the date hereof and ending as follows: If the Purchaser or SHRA does not offer Ermilio an extension (\""Extension\"") of his employment agreement, of even date herewith, with SHRA beyond the expiration date of the original one-year term (\""Expiration Date\""), then the Restricted Period shall be one (1) year from the date hereof. If the Purchaser or SHRA offers Ermilio an Extension, then the Restricted Period shall extend until the later of (i) two (2) years from the date hereof and (ii) one (1) year from the date of his termination of employment with the SHRA, or any Affiliate of SHRA, for any reason.\n2 Nondisclosure. Ermilio understands and agrees that the business of the Purchaser and its Affiliates is based upon specialized work and Confidential Information (as hereinafter defined). Ermilio agrees that during the Restricted Period, he shall keep secret all such Confidential Information and that he will not, directly or indirectly, use for his own benefit or for the benefit of others nor Disclose (as hereinafter defined), without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, any Confidential Information. At any time upon the Purchaser's request, Ermilio shall turn over to the Purchaser all books, notes, memoranda, manuals, notebooks, records and other documents made, compiled by, delivered to, or in the possession or control of Ermilio containing or concerning any Confidential Information, including all copies thereof, in any form or format, including any computer hard disks, wherever located, containing any such information, it being agreed that the same and all information contained therein are at all times the exclusive property of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Confidential Information\"" means any information or compilation of information not generally known to the public or the industry, that is proprietary or confidential to the Purchaser, its Affiliates and/or those doing business with the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, including but not limited to know-how, process, techniques, methods, plans, specifications, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, supplier lists, customer lists, mailing lists, financial information, business plans and/or policies, methods of operation, sales and marketing plans and any other information acquired or developed by Ermilio in the course of his past, present and future dealings with the Purchaser and its Affiliates, which is not readily available to the public.\n\""Confidential Information\"" does not include any information, datum or fact: (a) currently available to the public as of the date hereof; (b) after it becomes available to the public other than as a result of a breach hereof or other wrongful conduct by Executive; (c) after it becomes available to Executive on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company or its Affiliates or a person or entity breaching his or its confidentiality agreement or other relationship of confidence with the Company or its Affiliates; or (d) developed independently by Executive without any reference to or use whatsoever of any Confidential Information of the Company or its Affiliates.\nAs used in this Agreement, the term \""Disclose\"" means to reveal, deliver, divulge, disclose, publish, copy, communicate, show, allow or permit access to, or otherwise make known or available to any third party, any of the Confidential Information.\n3 Blue Pencil Doctrine.

If Ermilio shall breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of Section 1 and/or Section 2, in addition to and without limiting any other remedies available to the Purchaser at law or in equity, the Purchaser shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in any court to restrain any such breach or threatened breach and to enforce the provisions of Section 1 and/or Section 2, as the case may be. Ermilio acknowledges and agrees that there is no adequate remedy at law for any such breach or threatened breach and, in the event that any proceeding is brought seeking injunctive relief, Ermilio shall not use as a defense thereto that there is an adequate remedy at law.\n5 Reasonableness of Covenants. Ermilio acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are a necessary inducement to Purchaser purchasing Ermilio's ownership interests in the Companies, and that the scope (geographic and otherwise) and period of duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are both fair and reasonable and that the interests sought to be protected by the Purchaser are legitimate business interests entitled to be protected. Ermilio further acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser would not have purchased Ermilio's ownership interests in the Companies pursuant to the Purchase Agreement unless Ermilio entered into this Agreement.\n6 General Provisions.\n(A) Entire Agreement.

"      August 7, 1997\nMs. Donna M. Hitscherich\nVice President\nJ.P. Morgan Securities Inc.\n60 Wall Street\nNew York, New York 10260\nDear Ms. Hitscherich:\nCarpenter Technology Corporation (\""we\"", \""our\"" or \""us\"") has requested information regarding Talley Industries, Inc. (the \""Company\"", \""your\"" or \""you\"") in connection with our consideration of the possible acquisition of the Company (a \""Possible Transaction\""). In consideration of your furnishing us with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) we agree as follows:\nConfidentiality of Evaluation Materials\nWe will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either the Company or its financial advisor, J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated (\""JPM\""), or the Company's other representatives furnish to us in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by us, or by our representatives (as defined below) which contain or otherwise reflect such information or our review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the \""Evaluation Materials\""). We recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \""Evaluation Materials\"" includes information furnished to us orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \""confidential\"". The term \""Evaluation Materials\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by us or our representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to us on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to us by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by us.\nUse of Evaluation Materials\nWe will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. We and our representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may be disclosed to those of our directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \""our representatives\"") who we reasonably determine need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between us and the Company (it being understood that our representatives shall be informed by us of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by us, and shall each agree to treat such information confidentially) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither we nor our representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. We will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by our representatives. In the event that we or any of our representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, we or our representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) we or our representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which we are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise our best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) we shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by us or our representatives not permitted by this Agreement. Non-Disclosure\nThe disclosure of our possible interest in purchasing the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement of purchase and sale is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, we agree that prior to the execution of a Sale Agreement with respect to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, we will not, and we will direct our representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction between us and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof unless we are advised by counsel that we are required to make such disclosure. The term \""person\"" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.\nReturn of Documents\nUpon the Company's request, we shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials.\nNo Unauthorized Contact\nDuring the course of our evaluation, all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to JPM or employees or representatives of the Company specified by JPM. Accordingly, we agree not to directly or indirectly contact or communicate with any executive or other employee of the Company concerning a Possible Transaction, or to seek any information in connection therewith from such person, without the express consent of JPM, with the exception of direct communication between our chairman and the Company's chairman. We also agree not to discuss with or offer to any third party an equity participation in a Possible Transaction or any other form of joint acquisition by us and such third party without JPM's prior written consent provided that the foregoing undertaking shall not prevent us from soliciting, on a confidential basis, indications of intent from selected third parties for the purchase of portions of the Company.\nFor a period of two years following the date hereof, you will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any officer, director, or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or divisions with whom you have had contact or who became known to you in connection with your consideration of the Possible Transaction, except that you shall not be precluded from hiring any such employee who (i) initiates discussions regarding such employment without any direct or indirect solicitation by you, (ii) responds to any public advertisement placed by you, or (iii) has been terminated by the Company or its subsidiaries prior to commencement of employment discussions between you and such officer, director, or employee.\nStandstill\nWe agree that until two years from the date of this Agreement, we will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a \""group\"" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger.\nNo Representation or Warranty\nAlthough the Company and JPM have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of our investigation, we acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied hereunder, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, JPM or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to us or any other person hereunder resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by us or any of our representatives. Only those representations or warranties that are made to a purchaser in a definitive sale agreement for the Company (\""Sale Agreement\"") when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.\nWe also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for the sale of the Company shall be deemed to exist between us and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, and we hereby waive, in advance, any claims (including, without limitation, breach of contract) in connection with the sale of the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto. We also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and us with respect to the acquisition of the Company has been executed and delivered by us and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \""Sale Agreement\"" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by us.\nNo Solicitation\nDuring the period from acceptance of this agreement until the earlier of (a): the execution of a definitive agreement or (b) the date that is 45 days after the date of such acceptance, the Company and the officers, directors, employees and other representatives of the Company including JPM shall not directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage any offers or proposals for the acquisition of the Company, or of any of the capital stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, from third parties (an \""Acquisition Proposal\""). The Company may, however, participate in discussions or negotiations with, and provide confidential information to, a third party, if the Chairman of the Board of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice from the Company's financial advisor, that such third party has submitted a bona fide proposal or indication of interest that is, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal that is financially superior to the non-binding indication of interest contained in the letter of August 7, 1997 from Robert W. Cardy to Paul L. Foster; provided, however, that the Company agrees to inform us of the receipt of any such proposal.\nLegal Remedy\nWe understand and agree that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives and that the Company will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by us or our representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.\nOther\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.\nVery truly yours,\nCARPENTER TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION\nBy: /s/ G.

The parties acknowledge and agree that there is no adequate remedy at law for any such breach or threatened breach and, in the event that any proceeding is brought seeking injunctive relief, the breaching party shall not use as a defense thereto that there is an adequate remedy at law.\n6 Reasonableness of Covenants. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are a necessary inducement to Purchaser purchasing Seller's ownership interests in NIM and its subsidiaries, and that the scope (geographic and otherwise) and period of duration of the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement are both fair and reasonable and that the interests sought to be protected by NIM are legitimate business interests entitled to be protected. Seller further acknowledges and agrees that NIM would not have purchased Seller's ownership interests in the Companies pursuant to the Purchase Agreement unless Seller entered into this Agreement.

No Further Obligations or Agreements Hereunder. Neither party shall be under any obligation to enter into any further agreements with the other Party as a result of this Agreement.

NON-DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. (a) the Company shall (i) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction and for no other competitive or other purpose; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except for disclosures to its directors, officers, employees and representatives of its advisors (such as independent accountants, investment bankers and attorneys) acting on its behalf (such directors, officers, employees and representatives being referred to hereinafter collectively as its \""Representatives\"") who in each case, in the Company's reasonable judgment, need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction; provided, however, that prospective financing sources shall not be considered \""Representatives\"" to whom Confidential Information may be disclosed in accordance with this paragraph 1 unless specifically requested by the Company and consented to by MCI in writing; (iii) inform its Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and direct its Representatives to treat the Confidential Information confidentially; (iv) take all additional reasonable precautions necessary to prevent the disclosure of the Confidential Information by its Representatives to any third party; and (v) be responsible for any breach of this Agreement (the \""Agreement\"") by its Representatives.\n(b) If the Company or its Representatives is requested (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it is agreed that the Company will provide MCI with prompt notice of such request so that MCI may seek an appropriate protective order and/or waive the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.

You recognize and acknowledge the confidential and non-public nature of the Evaluation Materials, the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials, and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \""Evaluation Materials\"" includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection regarding the Company, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \""confidential\"". The term \""Evaluation Materials\"" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other\nPage 2\nthan as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you.\nUse of Evaluation Materials\nYou will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \""your representatives\"") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you, and shall each expressly agree, to treat such information confidentially in accordance with this Agreement), (ii) you may disclose Evaluation Materials that you have been advised by counsel are required to be disclosed under applicable securities laws; and (iii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure.

"      AGREEMENT FOR NON-DISCLOSURE OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND STANDSTILL\nThis Agreement, made as of this 13th day of March, 1997, by and between CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY, with a principal place of business located at 935 de La Gauchetiere St. W., Montreal, Province of Quebec, Canada, and ILLINOIS CENTRAL CORP., with a principal place of business located at 455 North Cityfront Plaza Drive, Chicago, State of Illinois, is to assure the protection and preservation of the confidential and proprietary nature of information to be disclosed or made available under this Agreement, and shall be governed by and enforceable under, the laws of the State of New York.\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the parties hereto (each referred to herein as a \""Party\"") are giving consideration to a possible transaction, including a possible business combination, joint venture or other possible arrangement involving the parties (a \""Business Arrangement\"") and in connection therewith it is expected that each Party furnish to the other Party certain Proprietary Information (as defined below);\nAND WHEREAS, each Party desires to assure the confidential and proprietary status of the Proprietary Information which may be disclosed hereunder;\nAND WHEREAS, the parties also desire that any Proprietary Information that is disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the other Party or, as permitted hereunder, to its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, representatives (including financial advisors, attorneys and accountants) or agents (collectively, \""Representatives\""), be used only for the purposes of evaluating a possible Business Arrangement;\nAGREEMENT\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged; the parties agree as follows:\n1. The Party receiving Proprietary Information (the \""Recipient\"") and its Representatives will protect all Proprietary Information received under this Agreement from any disclosure to third parties or the use of such Proprietary Information beyond that allowed under this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this Agreement, and will not engage in such disclosure or use without the prior express written permission of the Party disclosing such information (the \""Disclosing Party\"").\n2. Proprietary Information which may be supplied and is protected under this Agreement includes, but is not limited to: all business plans, specifications, reports, manuals, data books, computer programs, techniques, employment arrangements, and all other business practices or information of a private nature on any media whatsoever, and any derivatives of the foregoing, including, without limitation, any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, memoranda or other documents prepared by the Recipient, or its Representatives, which contain, reflect or are based on, in whole or in part, such proprietary information (collectively, \""Proprietary Information\""). Such Proprietary Information includes data transferred in the form of, but not limited to, oral, written, graphic or computer media including telephone, and meeting conversations, as well as all analyses, compilations, forecasts, studies or other documents which include any Proprietary Information. The term \""Proprietary Information\"" does not include confidential information which (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's Representatives, (ii) was available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to Recipient by Disclosing Party or its Representatives, (iii) is independently developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without the use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, or (iv) becomes available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Disclosing Party or its Representatives, provided that such source, to Recipient's knowledge, is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with Disclosing Party or its Representatives, or is otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to Recipient by a contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation. In the event that Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigation demand or other similar process) or required by the rules of any relevant stock exchange or other relevant regulatory authority to disclose any Proprietary Information, Recipient or its Representatives shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Disclosing Party, the Recipient or its Representatives are nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, required to disclose Proprietary Information, the Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which in the opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided that the Recipient or its Representatives attempt to preserve the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the Disclosing Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Proprietary Information.\n3. Recipient agrees to keep confidential or protect such Proprietary Information as it would its own confidential and proprietary information at the highest level of proprietary material. Disclosure of such Proprietary Information shall be restricted to those Representatives of Recipient who (i) have a need to know the information for the purpose of evaluating a possible Business Arrangement between the parties and (ii) are informed by the Disclosing Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party will cause its Representatives to observe the terms of this Agreement and the Disclosing Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n4. All Proprietary Information, including all applicable intellectual property rights residing in the Proprietary Information (including without limitation, patents, copyrights, industrial designs, trademarks and trade secrets), unless otherwise specified in writing by Disclosing Party, are and shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party, including any and all reproductions in any form of said Proprietary Information. All such Proprietary Information (whether prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives on its behalf) shall be returned or destroyed, at the election of Disclosing Party or upon request of Disclosing Party provided, however, that all notes, analyses, conditions, studies, interpretations, memoranda or other documents, to the extent that they contain, reflect or are based upon the Proprietary Information, may be destroyed (rather than delivered); provided further that Board or Board Committee minutes need neither be delivered nor destroyed. Upon the request of Disclosing Party, Recipient shall execute a certificate of destruction of such Proprietary Information when destroyed by Recipient, whether intentionally or accidentally, and transmit the same to Disclosing Party.\n5. Proprietary Information supplied under this Agreement shall only be reproduced when legitimately required for Recipient's purposes and in conformity with the provisions hereof.\n6. Recipient hereby agrees that it will not use the Proprietary Information for any reason or purpose other than to evaluate a possible Business Arrangement with the Disclosing Party and that the use of the Proprietary Information supplied hereunder shall be limited to Recipient's activities in connection therewith. For greater certainty nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as granting or conferring upon the Recipient or its Representatives, any rights by license or otherwise, for any invention, discovery or improvement made, conceived or acquired, prior to or after the date of this Agreement based in whole, or in part, upon Proprietary Information provided to the Recipient or its Representatives hereunder.\n7. Neither Party, nor any of their respective Representatives will, without the prior written consent of the other Party, disclose to any person the fact that the Proprietary Information exists or has been made available, that such Party is considering a proposed Business Arrangement with the other Party, or that discussions or negotiations are taking or have taken place concerning a proposed Business Arrangement or any term condition or other fact relating to a proposed Business Arrangement or such discussions or negotiations, including, without limitation, the status thereof, except if it has received legal advice that such disclosure is reasonably required under then existing circumstances pursuant to any securities or similar laws of any relevant state or country, or rules of any relevant stock exchange or other relevant authority of whatever nature; provided, however, that each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other before issuing an announcement or a public statement.\n8. In the event that Recipient violates this Agreement or Disclosing Party has reasonable cause to feel that its Proprietary Information is in danger of being disclosed or misused, either Party may at any time, in addition to all other recourse under law, terminate this Agreement and demand and be entitled to the return from Recipient of all Proprietary Information in all existing forms.\n9. It is further understood and agreed that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by Recipient and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctions and orders for specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to Disclosing Party.\n10. Neither Party, nor any of their Representatives or controlling persons within the meaning of Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder, and each Party agrees that no such person will have any liability relating to the Proprietary Information or for any errors therein or omissions therefrom. Each Party further agrees that neither Party shall be entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information and that each Party will be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties as may be included in any definitive agreement with respect to any agreement that may be entered into between the parties hereafter, subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be contained therein.\n11.

Each Party also agrees during such eighteen (18) month period not to (i) request the other Party or its Representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provisions of this paragraph (including this sentence) or (ii) take any initiative in respect of the other Party which would, upon the advice of counsel, reasonably require the other Party to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of such Party acquiring, with or without others, control of the other Party whether by means of business combination or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 11, Party shall include its parent and affiliated companies.\n12. If, at any time during the period prior to the time that either Party notifies the other of its decision not to proceed with any Business Arrangement, either Party is approached by, or commences discussions with, any third party concerning its or their participation in a transaction involving the other's securities or a significant portion of its assets or its significant businesses, the contacted Party will promptly inform the other of the nature of such contact and the parties thereto.\n13. This Agreement shall supersede all prior oral and written agreements, communications and documents between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and no modification to this Agreement shall be effective unless approved in writing by both parties. A waiver of any term of this Agreement shall, to be effective, be evidenced in writing by the waiving Party. Each Party agrees that, unless and until a definitive agreement between each of the Parties with respect to a Business Arrangement has been executed and delivered, neither of us will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by the Party's Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \""definitive agreement\"" shall not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement unless and to the extent it expressly states that it is to be legally binding. The agreement set forth in this paragraph may be modified or waived only by a separate writing by each of us expressly so modifying or waiving such agreement.\n14. Nothing in this Agreement shall grant to either Party the right to make commitments of any kind for or on behalf of the other Party.\n15. The provisions of this Agreement pertaining to Proprietary Information disclosed under this Agreement shall continue and survive for a period of three (3) years after the termination of this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.\nCANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY COMPANY\nBY: /s/ Jean Pierre Ouellet\nITS: Chief Legal Officer & Corporate\nSecretary\nILLINOIS CENTRAL CORP.\nBY:\nITS:\n"","

"      CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT (\""Agreement\"") is made as of January 31, 2001 by and between Sunglass Hut International, Inc., a Florida corporation (\""Sunglass Hut\""), and Luxottica Group S.p.A, an Italian corporation (\""Luxottica\"") (Sunglass Hut and Luxottica are collectively referred to herein as the \""Parties\"").\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to provide for the disclosure of information relating to Sunglass Hut and maintenance of the confidentiality thereof with respect of the evaluation by Luxottica of a possible transaction (the \""Possible Transaction\"");\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, for good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n1. DEFINITIONS. The following terms are defined as follows:\n(a) \""Evaluation Material\"" means any oral or written information concerning Sunglass Hut, its subsidiaries, business, markets, products, prospects or finances furnished by it (in such capacity, the \""Provider\"") or any of its Representatives (as defined below) to Luxottica (in such capacity, the \""Recipient\"") or any of its Representatives, except information which: (i) is or becomes generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by the Recipient or any of its Representatives who received such information pursuant hereto); (ii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or any of its Representatives on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Provider or any of its Representatives; provided, that such source is not and was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other similar obligation to, the Provider of which the Recipient or any of its Representatives are aware; or (iii) has been independently acquired or developed by the Recipient or any of its Representatives without violating any of its obligations under this Agreement.\n(b) A \""Representative\"" of a Party includes any officer, director, shareholder, employee, advisor, attorney, consultant or agent of such Party.\n2. USE OF EVALUATION MATERIAL. Any Evaluation Material provided to the Recipient hereunder will be used by the Recipient and its Representatives solely for the purpose of evaluating the Possible Transaction and will not be used by the Recipient in any way detrimental to the Provider or its stockholders. The Recipient will maintain the strict confidentiality of any Evaluation Material provided to it or any of its Representatives by the other Party or any of the other Party's Representatives and will not disclose any part of it to any other person; provided, however, that it may disclose any such Evaluation Material or portions thereof to those of its Representatives who need to know such information in order to assist the Recipient in evaluating the advisability of entering into the Possible Transaction and it may disclose any such Evaluation Material in accordance with Paragraph 5 hereof.\n3. REPRESENTATIVES. The Recipient will (a) provide the other Party with a list of its Representatives who are given access to any Evaluation Material, (b) inform each such Representative of the terms of this Agreement, and (c) obtain the agreement of each such Representative to abide by the terms of this Agreement. Each Party will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n4. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Party will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities and costs that any other Party may sustain or incur as a result of any breach of this Agreement by such Party or any of its Representatives.\n5. SUBPOENAS, ETC. If the Recipient or any of its Representatives becomes required by law or applicable legal process (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Evaluation Material furnished by the Provider, the Recipient will provide the Provider with prompt prior written notice of such requirement and the terms of and circumstances surrounding such requirement so that the Provider may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and the Recipient will provide such cooperation with respect to obtaining a protective order or other remedy as the Provider may reasonably request. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Provider is required to waive compliance with the provisions hereof, Recipient will furnish only that portion of such Evaluation Material which, as it is advised in a written opinion by its counsel, is legally required to furnish and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment, if available, will be accorded such Evaluation Material.\n6. TERMINATION. If any Party decides that it does not wish to proceed with a Possible Transaction, it will promptly advise the other Parties of that decision. In such event, the Recipient promptly will return to the Provider all copies of any Evaluation Material in its possession or in the possession of any of its Representatives furnished by such Provider or any of its Representatives, and the Recipient will destroy all analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by it or any of its Representatives or for their use containing or reflecting any Evaluation Material, whether in digital, written or other form. Any destruction required pursuant to this Paragraph 6 will be certified in writing to the Provider by an authorized officer supervising such destruction.\n7. NON-DISCLOSURE. Without the prior written consent of the other Party, each Party will not, and will direct its Representatives not to, disclose to any person that any investigations, discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction, that such Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any Possible Transaction, including the status thereof.\n8. NO SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Each Party covenants that for a period of two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, such Party will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any employee of the other Party or any of the other Party's subsidiaries with whom such Party has had contact or who became known to such Party in connection with its consideration of the Possible Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision will not prevent a Party from employing any employee of the other Party who contacts the prospective employer Party on his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the prospective employer Party, or prevent a general solicitation conducted in the ordinary course of business and not directed specifically at the employees of the other Party.\n9. ACCURACY OF MATERIALS. The Provider does not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials provided or to be provided by it or any of its Representatives. Neither the Provider nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Recipient or any person resulting from the Recipient's use of any Evaluation Material provided by the Provider or any of its Representatives or the contents thereof or from any action taken or any inaction occurring in reliance thereon.\n10. NO COMMITMENT. No contract or agreement providing for any transaction or other arrangement between the Parties exists. Neither Party nor any of their respective stockholders or owners will have any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any transaction or other arrangement by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to any transaction or other arrangement except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Each Party will be free to conduct or terminate the process whereby it may enter into any transaction or other arrangement as such Party in its sole discretion will determine. No Party will have any claims whatsoever against the other Party or any of the other Party's Representatives arising out or relating to any transaction or other arrangement. Neither this Paragraph 10 nor any other provision in this Agreement can be waived or amended except by written consent of both Parties.\n11. COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. Each Party acknowledges that it is aware (and that its Representatives who are apprised of a Proposed Transaction have been, or upon being so apprised will be, advised) of the restrictions imposed by certain securities laws on a person possessing material non-public information about certain companies and agrees to comply with such laws.\n12. EQUITABLE REMEDIES. The Parties acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate remedy for breach of this Agreement because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of damage that will be suffered in the event that this Agreement is breached. Therefore, each Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other Party or any of its Representatives, in addition to all other remedies available to such Party at law or in equity.\n13. NO WAIVERS. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.\n14. INTEGRATION. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, agreements and understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n15. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. All Parties' obligations under this Agreement will expire one year from the date of this Agreement. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first hereinabove written.\nSUNGLASS HUT INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nBy: /s/ James N.

Participant acknowledges and affirms that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by it and that Originator shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Participant has breached this Agreement, then Participant shall be liable for and shall pay to Originator the reasonable legal fees and expenses and court costs incurred by Originator in connection with any such litigation, including any appeal therefrom.\n9.

Selling Shareholder agrees that the restrictions, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement are (i) reasonable in all respects (including, without limitation, geographic area and duration), (ii) necessary to protect the value of Dollar Tree, and (iii) are not unduly harsh upon Selling Shareholder's ability to earn a livelihood. Selling Shareholder represents that upon careful review, Selling Shareholder knows of no reason why any agreement, covenant, or restriction contained in this Agreement is not reasonable and enforceable.\n8.2 If any provision of this Agreement shall be found by any arbitration panel or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be replaced by such panel or court by a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of the invalid or unenforceable provision and, as modified, shall be enforced as any other provision hereof, all other provisions continuing in full force and effect to the maximum extent possible.

"      NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (this \""AGREEMENT\"") is entered into as of September 20, 1999 (the \""EFFECTIVE DATE\"") by and between Premisys Communications, Inc. (\""PREMISYS\"") and Zhone Corporation (\""RECIPIENT\"").\nThe parties desire to pursue certain business discussions solely for the purpose (the \""BUSINESS PURPOSE\"") of evaluating a possible business transaction between themselves, including discussions regarding (i) the strategic importance and value of Premisys or any of its products or technology to Recipient's business, and (ii) the possible structures of any business transaction between Premisys and Recipient. In connection with such discussions, Premisys may elect to make available and disclose to Recipient certain of its confidential information solely for the Business Purpose.\nAccordingly, in consideration of the disclosure of any such confidential information by Premisys to Recipient, and the mutual agreements of the parties set forth in this Agreement, and in order to facilitate the evaluation of the possible business transaction described above, the parties agree as follows:\n1. DEFINITION OF \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. As used in this Agreement, \""CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\"" means all information disclosed by Premisys or its agents to Recipient (or to Recipient's attorneys, accountants or other professional advisors, collectively, its \""REPRESENTATIVES\"") in connection with the Business Purpose, including without limitation, information regarding Premisys' products, computer software, technology, agreements, customers, suppliers, financial condition, business plans or strategies and also includes all information contained in any notes, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations or other documents prepared by Recipient or its Representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, the information furnished by Premisys or its agents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Confidential Information will NOT include information that:\n(a) is as of the Effective Date, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of Recipient, generally known or readily ascertainable through proper means to persons knowledgeable in the relevant industry;\n(b) was acquired by Recipient by proper means without restriction as to use or disclosure BEFORE receiving such information from Premisys;\n(c) is hereafter rightfully furnished to Recipient by a third party, without restriction as to use or disclosure; or\n(d) was independently developed by Recipient without use of Premisys' Confidential Information.\n2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE. Recipient agrees: (a) to hold Premisys' Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties (other than on a confidential basis to its Representatives in furtherance of the Business Purpose); and (c) not to use any Confidential Information for any purpose except for the Business Purpose. Recipient may disclose Premisys' Confidential Information to its employees with a bona fide need to know, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to carry out the Business Purpose. Recipient agrees to instruct all such employees that they may not use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Business Purpose and (except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement) not to disclose such Confidential Information to third parties, including consultants, without the prior written consent of Premisys.\n3. NON-DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTION. Recipient will not, without the prior written consent of Premisys, disclose to any third party (except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement) the fact that any Confidential Information has been disclosed hereunder, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the parties or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Recipient (and its Representatives) may make such disclosure if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for such party, such disclosure is required by law, regulation or any stock exchange or the Nasdaq National Market.\n4. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. In the event that Recipient or any of its Representatives is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information of Premisys, Recipient shall provide Premisys with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that Premisys may seek a protective order, confidential treatment or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order, confidential treatment or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Premisys, Recipient or its Representatives are requested or required to make the disclosure and, in the reasonable opinion of legal counsel for Recipient, legally compelled to disclose Premisys' Confidential Information to any court, tribunal or agency or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Recipient or its Representatives may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal or agency only that portion of Premisys' Confidential Information which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed, provided that Recipient and its Representative exercise their best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of Premisys' Confidential Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with Premisys to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded Premisys' Confidential Information by such tribunal or agency.\n5.
